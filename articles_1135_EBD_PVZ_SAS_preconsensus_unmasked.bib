  abstract={Background context: 
Vertebral compression fractures secondary to low bone mass are responsible for almost 130,000 inpatient admissions and 133,500 emergency department visits annually, totaling over $5 billion of direct inpatient costs. Although most vertebral compression fractures heal within a few months with conservative therapy, a significant portion fail to improve with conservative treatment and require long-term care, conservative treatment, or both. Fractures that fail conservative therapy are treated with vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs) such as vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP). Two large randomized clinical trials published in 2009 questioned the efficacy of VP in treatment of VAPs.
Purpose: 
This study aimed to investigate trends in utilization of VP and KP between 2005 and 2010 to capture the impact of the 2009 literature on utilization of VAPs. The study also compares patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes between VP and KP to further delineate the risks of each procedure.
Study design: 
Retrospective analysis of national utilization rates, clinical outcomes, patient demographics, and patient comorbidities using a large national inpatient database.
Patient sample: 
A total of 63,459 inpatient admissions from 46 states and more than 1,000 different hospitals were included in the analysis.
Outcome measures: 
Length of stay (LOS), total direct cost, mortality, postoperative complications.
Methods: 
Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample database for the period between 2005 and 2010. National Inpatient Sample is the largest publicly available all payer inpatient database in the United States. Patients undergoing VP and KP were identified via corresponding the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision procedure codes. National utilization trends were estimated using weights supplied as part of the National Inpatient Sample dataset. Information on patient comorbidities and demographics was collected. A series of univariate and multivarariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant differences in patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as cost and LOS between patients undergoing VP versus KP.
Results: 
A total of 307,050 inpatient VAPs were performed in the United States between 2005 and 2010. Of those procedures, 225,259 were KP and 81,790 were VP. Kyphoplasty utilization showed an increasing trend between 2005 and 2007, increasing from 27 to 33 procedures per 100,000 capita older than 40 years. During the same time period, VP utilization remained constant at approximately nine procedures per 100,000 capita older than 40 years. After 2007, utilization of both VP and KP decreased. The most precipitous decrease in VAP utilization occurred in 2009. Patients undergoing VP were on average older (76.7 vs. 77.8, p<.0001), more frequently women (74.48% vs. 73.15%, p=.00083), and black (1.77% vs. 1.55%, p=.004059). Patients undergoing VP had on average more comorbidities then those undergoing KP. Patients undergoing VP had a higher rate of postoperative anemia secondary to acute bleeding and higher rate of venous thromboembolic events. Those undergoing KP had a greater rate of cardiac complications; however, this difference was not statistically significant when taking into account patient age and comorbidity burden. Vertebroplasty was associated with higher mortality (0.93% vs. 0.60%, p<.001), longer LOS (6.78 vs. 5.05 days, p<.0001), and lower total cost ($42,154 vs. $46,101, p<.0001).
Conclusions: 
Overall, KP was associated with lower complication rates, shorter LOS, and a higher total direct cost compared with VP. Utilization rates showed a significant decrease since 2009 in both VP and KP, suggesting that both procedures were impacted by the two randomized controlled trials published in 2009 that suggested poor efficacy of VP.},

  abstract={Background: 
Few references are available describing the epidemiology of pediatric spine injuries. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence, risk factors and trends during the period from 1997 to 2009 of pediatric spine injuries in the United States using a large national database.
Methods: 
Data was obtained from the Kid's Inpatient Database (KID) developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), for the years 1997-2009. This data includes >3 million discharges from 44 states and 4121 hospitals on children younger than 20 years. Weighted variables are provided which allow for the calculation of national prevalence rates. The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), HCUP. net, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data were used for verification and comparison.
Results: 
A prevalence of 107.96 pmp (per million population) spine injuries in children and adolescents was found in 2009, which is increased from the 77.07 pmp observed in 1997. The group 15 to 19 years old had the highest prevalence of all age groups in (345.44 pmp). Neurological injury was present in 14.6% of the cases, for a prevalence of 15.82 pmp. The majority (86.7%) of these injuries occurred in children >15 years. Motor vehicle collisions accounted for 52.9% of all spine injuries, particularly in children >15 years. Between 1997 and 2009 the hospital length of stay decreased, but hospital charges demonstrated a significant increase.
Conclusions: 
Pediatric Spine Injuries continue to be a relevant problem, with rates exceeding those of other industrialized nations. Teenagers >15 years of age were at greatest risk, and motor vehicle collisions accounted for the most common mechanism. An increase in prevalence was observed between 1997 and 2009, and this was matched by a similar increase in hospital charges.
Level of evidence:

  abstract={Background context: 
The clinical outcome of patients with ankylosing spinal disorders (ASDs) sustaining a spinal fracture has been described to be worse compared with the general trauma population.
Purpose: 
To investigate clinical outcome (neurologic deficits, complications, and mortality) after spinal injury in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) compared with control patients.
Study design: 
Retrospective cohort study.
Patient sample: 
All patients older than 50 years and admitted with a traumatic spinal fracture to the Emergency Department of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, a regional level-1 trauma center and tertiary referral spine center.
Outcome measures: 
Data on comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity score), mechanism of trauma, fracture characteristics, neurologic deficit, complications, and in-hospital mortality were collected from medical records.
Methods: 
With logistic regression analysis, the association between the presence of an ASD and mortality was investigated in relation to other known risk factors for mortality.
Results: 
A total of 165 patients met the inclusion criteria; 14 patients were diagnosed with AS (8.5%), 40 patients had DISH (24.2%), and 111 patients were control patients (67.3%). Ankylosing spinal disorder patients were approximately five years older than control patients and predominantly of male gender. The Charlson comorbidity score did not significantly differ among the groups, but Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity were more prevalent among DISH patients. In many AS and DISH cases, fractures resulted from low-energy trauma and showed a hyperextension configuration. Patients with AS and DISH were frequently admitted with a neurologic deficit (57.1% and 30.0%, respectively) compared with controls (12.6%; p=.002), which did not improve in the majority of cases. In AS and DISH patients, complication and mortality rates were significantly higher than in controls. Logistic regression analysis showed the parameters age and presence of DISH to be independently, statistically significantly related to mortality.
Conclusions: 
Many patients with AS and DISH showed unstable (hyperextension) fracture configurations and neurologic deficits. Complication and mortality rates were higher in patients with ASD compared with control patients. Increasing age and presence of DISH are predictors of mortality after a spinal fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Kyphoplasty has been proven to be an efficient method to relieve patient suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Because of its technological superiority, unilateral kyphoplasty consumes less operative time and bone cement than traditional bilateral kyphoplasty. However, there is controversy about which method is most efficient in the treatment of OVCFs. Thus, an overall analysis should be performed to shed light on the facts corroborating both procedures.
Objective: 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in treating OVCFs.
Study design: 
Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials focusing on comparing unilateral versus bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs. The exclusion criteria contained infection, neoplastic etiology, traumatic fracture, neural compression, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, long-term use of steroids, and kyphoplasty with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment. Retrospective studies, reviews, technology introductions, and biochemical trials were also excluded.
Settings: 
The PubMed MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematic searched. Only randomized controlled trials published up to June 2015 comparing unilateral kyphoplasty with bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs were identified.
Methods: 
Two researchers independently screeded the works for inclusion and data extraction. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the methodological quality and evidence synthesis.
Results: 
Six articles with 563 patients were enrolled in this study. Results showed that the unilateral approach required less surgical time (MD, -23.19; 95% CI, [-27.08, -19.31]; P < 0.00001) and cement consumption (MD, -2.07; 95% CI, [-2.23, -1.91]; P < 0.00001), as well as a reduced cement leakage ratio (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, [0.35, 0.99]; P < 0.05) and improved short-term general health (MD, 1.48; 95% CI, [0.02, 2.93], P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the visual analog scale score (short-term and long-term), Oswestry Disability Index score (mid-term and long-term) kyphotic angle reduction, restoration rate of anterior vertebral height, vertebral height loss rate, postoperative adjacent-level fractures, or in other assessments of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey parameters (short-term and long-term).
Limitations: 
Only 6 studies were included, so that the sample size was still relatively small and publication bias could not be revealed in this study. Observation time of some data was inconsistent. All of these problems could influence the reliability of the results.
Conclusion: 
Both unilateral kyphoplasty and bilateral kyphoplasty are safe and effective treatments for OVCFs. However, when operative time, cement volume, cement leakage, short-term general health, radiation dose, and hospitalization costs are taken into consideration, unilateral kyphoplasty may be the better choice. Yet, more high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required to make the final conclusion.Key words: Kyphoplasty, unilateral approach, bilateral approach, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, meta-analysis.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) and open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) in the treatment of single level of thoracolumbar fracture.
Methods: 
Databases including Pubmed, Embasem, CNKI were searched to collect clinical trials of the clinical safety and efficiency of PPSF and OPSF for single level of thoracolumbar unstable fracture, relevant proceedings and references were also retrieved manually. Studies from 1990 to 2014 that met the inclusion and exclusion standards were researched. The data were extracted and the methods from the studies were also evaluated. Data analysis was conducted with the Review Manager 5.3 software. Observation targets included operation time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative bleeding, hospitalization time, the bed time, postoperative vertebral Cobb angle, vertebral body height, pain score and the length of incision operation.
Results: 
Fifteen papers were finally studied, including 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 13 case-control studies, involving 789 patients. Compared with OPSF, the PPSF in treating thoracolumbar fracture had shorter operation time, smaller operation incision, less intraoperative and postoperation bleeding, shorter hospitalization days, fewer pain (P<0.00001), the less improvement in the change of Cobb angle (P=0.0006). There was no significant difference in the improvement of vertebral body height (P=0.36), the bed time from operation to exercise (P=0.38) between OPSF and PPSF.
Conclusion: 
Compared with OPSF, PPSF is better, safer, and has fewer pain. But there is no evidence that the PPSF is better in the recovery of the spinal height, and they have the same effect in the long-term follow-up for thoracolumbar fractures. PPSF brines minimally invasive to patients with better effect. It is worth further study and clinical research.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) can increase bone strength as well as alleviate the pain caused by vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), and both procedures rely on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement injected into the fractured vertebra for mechanical stabilization of the VCFs. However, there is debate over which of these 2 surgical procedures can give better short-term and long-term outcomes. A lot of studies and meta-analysis were designed to assess the advantages and drawbacks of PKP and PVP in the treatment of VCFs, but most of them didn't consider the effect of VCF levels on the treatment outcome, which can influence the results.
Objective: 
To assess the safety and efficacy of PKP compared to PVP in the treatment of single level osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF).
Study design: 
Studies with the following criteria were included: patients with VCFs due to osteoporosis; PKP comparing PVP; study design, RCT or prospective or retrospective comparative studies. Furthermore, the studies which reported at least one of the following outcomes: subjective pain perception, quality of life evaluation, incidence of new adjacent vertebral fracture, bone cement leakage, and post-operative kyphotic angle. Articles were excluded in our meta-analysis if they had a neoplastic etiology (i.e., metastasis or myeloma), infection, neural compression, traumatic fracture, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, severe degenerative diseases of the spine, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, and PKP or PVP with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment.
Setting: 
University hospital.
Methods: 
A systematic search of all articles published through May 2014 was performed by Medline, EMASE, OVID, and other databases. All the articles that compared PKP with PVP on single level OVCF were identified. The evidence quality levels of the selected articles were evaluated by Grade system. Data about the clinical outcomes and complications were extracted and analyzed.
Results: 
Eight studies, encompassing 845 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the results indicated that there were significant differences between the 2 groups in the short-term visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the long-term Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), short- and long-term kyphosis angle, the kyphosis angle improvement, the injected cement, and the cement leakage rates. However, there were no significant differences in the long-term VAS scores, the short-term ODI scores, the short- and long-term SF-36 scores, or the adjacent-level fracture rates.
Limitations: 
Statistical efficacy can be improved by more studies, low evidence based non-RCT articles are likely to induce various types of bias, no accurate definition of short-term and long-term outcome time points.
Conclusion: 
PKP and PVP are both safe and effective surgical procedures in treating OVCF. PKP has a similar long-term pain relief, function outcome (short-term ODI scores, short-and long-term SF-36 scores), and new adjacent VCFs in comparison to PVP. PKP is superior to PVP for the injected cement volume, the short-term pain relief, the improvement of short- and long-term kyphotic angle, and lower cement leakage rate. However, PKP has a longer operation time and higher material cost than PVP. To confirm this evaluation, a large multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) should be conducted.},

  abstract={Background: 
Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment of a stable burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction in neurologically intact patients have not shown a meaningful difference at early follow-up. To our knowledge, longer-term outcome data have not before been presented.
Methods: 
From 1992 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were evaluated and randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative treatment (posterior or anterior arthrodesis) or nonoperative treatment (a body cast or orthosis). We previously reported the results of follow-up at an average of forty-four months. The current study presents the results of long-term follow-up, at an average of eighteen years (range, sixteen to twenty-two years). As in the earlier study, patients at long-term follow-up indicated the degree of pain on a visual analog scale and completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Work and health status were obtained, and patients were evaluated radiographically.
Results: 
Of the original operatively treated group of twenty-four patients, follow-up data were obtained for nineteen; one patient had died, and four could not be located. Of the original nonoperatively treated group of twenty-three patients, data were obtained for eighteen; two patients had died, and three could not be located. The average kyphosis was not significantly different between the two groups (13° for those who received operative treatment compared with 19° for those treated nonoperatively). Median scores for pain (4 cm for the operative group and 1.5 cm for the nonoperative group; p = 0.003), ODI scores (20 for the operative group and 2 for the nonoperative group; p <0.001) and Roland and Morris scores (7 for the operative group and 1 for the nonoperative group; p = 0.001) were all significantly better in the group treated nonoperatively. Seven of eight SF-36 scores also favored nonoperative treatment.
Conclusions: 
While early analysis (four years) revealed few significant differences between the two groups, at long-term follow-up (sixteen to twenty-two years), those with a stable burst fracture who were treated nonoperatively reported less pain and better function compared with those who were treated surgically.},

  abstract={Background: 
The surgical results of treating thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were reported to be comparable between patients with and without fusion in an intermediate-term follow-up. To our knowledge, no prior report has compared the results of fusion and non-fusion with long-term follow-up.
Methods: 
This study was designed to provide long-term evaluation of patients with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine treated with short-segment fixation who were randomly assigned to a fusion or non-fusion group. Patients older than sixty years of age at the time of injury and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough Low-Back Outcome Score and the visual analog scale for back pain. Radiographic outcomes were focused on the vertebral body height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the regional segmental motion.
Results: 
Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the non-fusion group, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the fusion group. The average follow-up period was 134 months (range, 121 to 161 months). The average preoperative kyphotic angle was 16.4° for the non-fusion group and 19.5° for the fusion group. The average postoperative kyphotic angle was 1.5° for the non-fusion group and 4.0° for the fusion group. At the time of the latest follow-up, the average kyphotic angle was 13.8° for the non-fusion group and 14.7° for the fusion group. The average kyphotic angle between the two groups was similar at all follow-up times. A progressive decrease of the kyphotic angle was significant (p < 0.05) with time, regardless of fusion. The radiographic outcomes were similar between these two groups at all follow-up times, as were functional outcomes. More patients in the non-fusion group underwent additional surgery to remove implants. Regional segmental motion was preserved in the non-fusion group, with a mean motion (and standard deviation) of 4.2° ± 1.9°.
Conclusions: 
The long-term results of short segmental fixation with and without fusion for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were comparable. Regional segmental motion could be preserved without fusion, and bone graft donor site complications could be eliminated.

  abstract={Background: 
In the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, vertebral body stenting with an expandable scaffold inserted before application of the bone cement was developed to impede secondary loss of vertebral height encountered in patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether there are relevant differences between balloon kyphoplasty and vertebral body stenting with regard to perioperative and postoperative findings.
Methods: 
In a two-armed randomized controlled trial, patients with a total of 100 fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with either balloon kyphoplasty or vertebral body stenting. The primary outcome was the post-interventional change in the kyphotic angle on radiographs. The secondary outcomes were the maximum pressure of the balloon tamp during inflation, radiation exposure time, perioperative complications, and cement leakage.
Results: 
The mean reduction (and standard deviation) of kyphosis (the kyphotic correction angle) was 4.5° ± 3.6° after balloon kyphoplasty and 4.7° ± 4.2° after vertebral body stenting (p = 0.972). The mean pressures were 24 ± 5 bar (348 ± 72 pounds per square inch [psi]) during vertebral body stenting and 16 ± 6 bar (233 ± 81 psi) during balloon kyphoplasty (p = 0.014). There were no significant differences in radiation exposure time.None of the patients underwent revision surgery, and postoperative neurologic sequelae were not observed. Cement leakage occurred at twenty-five of the 100 vertebral levels without significant differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.230). Intraoperative material-related complications were observed at one of the fifty vertebral levels in the balloon kyphoplasty group and at nine of the fifty levels in the vertebral body stenting group.
Conclusions: 
No beneficial effect of vertebral body stenting over balloon kyphoplasty was found among patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures with regard to kyphotic correction, cement leakage, radiation exposure time, or neurologic sequelae. Vertebral body stenting was associated with significantly higher pressures during balloon inflation and more material-related complications.},

  abstract={Background: 
Fracture is the major complication of osteoporosis, and it allows the identification of individuals needing medical intervention for osteoporosis. After nonvertebral fracture, patients often do not receive osteoporosis medical treatment despite evidence that this treatment reduces the risk of subsequent fracture. In this pre planned analysis of the results of the three-year, placebo-controlled FREEDOM trial, we evaluated the effect of denosumab administration on fracture-healing to address theoretical concerns related to initiating or continuing denosumab therapy in patients presenting with a nonvertebral fracture.
Methods: 
Postmenopausal women aged sixty to ninety years with osteoporosis were randomized to receive 60 mg of denosumab (n = 3902) or a placebo (n = 3906) subcutaneously every six months for three years. Investigators reported complications associated with a fracture or its management and with fracture-healing for all nonvertebral fractures that occurred during the study. Delayed healing was defined as incomplete fracture-healing six months after the fracture.
Results: 
Six hundred and sixty-seven subjects (303 treated with denosumab and 364 who received a placebo) had a total of 851 nonvertebral fractures (386 in the denosumab group and 465 in the placebo group), including 199 fractures (seventy-nine in the denosumab group and 120 in the placebo group) that were treated surgically. Delayed healing was reported in seven subjects (two in the denosumab group and five in the placebo group), including one with subsequent nonunion (in the placebo group). Neither delayed healing nor nonunion was observed in any subject who had received denosumab within six weeks preceding or following the fracture. A complication associated with the fracture or intervention occurred in five subjects (2%) and twenty subjects (5%) in the denosumab and placebo groups,respectively (p = 0.009).
Conclusions: 
Denosumab in a dose of 60 mg every six months does not seem to delay fracture-healing or contribute to other complications, even when it is administered at or near the time of the fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Anterior screw fixation has been widely adopted for the treatment of type II dens fractures. However, there is still controversy regarding whether one- or two-screw fixation is more appropriate.
Questions::Purposes: 
We addressed three questions: (1) Do one- and two-screw fixation techniques differ regarding shear stiffness and rotational stiffness? (2) Can shear stiffness and rotational stiffness after screw fixation be restored to normal? (3) Does stiffness after screw fixation correlate with bone mineral density (BMD)?
Methods: 
We randomly assigned 14 fresh axes into two groups (seven axes each): one receiving one-screw fixation and another receiving two-screw fixation. Shear and torsional stiffness were measured using a nondestructive low-load test in six directions. A transverse osteotomy then was created at the base of the dens and fixed using one or two screws. Shear and torsional stiffness were tested again under the same testing conditions.
Results: 
Mean stiffness in all directions after screw fixation was similar in both groups. The stiffness after one- and two-screw fixation was not restored to normal: the mean shear stiffness restored ratio was less than 50% and the mean torsional stiffness restored ratio was less than 6% in both groups. BMD did not correlate with mean stiffness after screw fixation in both groups.
Conclusions: 
One- and two-screw fixation for type II dens fractures provide similar stability but neither restores normal shear or torsional stiffness.
Clinical relevance: 
One-screw fixation might be used as an alternative to two-screw fixation. Assumed BMD should not influence surgical decision making.},

  abstract={Background: 
Anterior C2/3 discectomy and interbody fusion (ACDF) with plating is increasingly performed as the primary treatment of unstable Hangman's fracture; however, plate-related complications, such as screw back-out, plate fracture and soft-tissue injury, is not uncommon. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage has now been developed to provide initial stability before fusion; however, whether and how ACDF with PEEK cage offer better clinical results compared with ACDF with plating in management of Hangman's fracture remains unknown. This study compares the efficacy of ACDF with plating to that of ACDF with PEEK cage in management of type II/IIA Hangman's fractures (according to Levine and Edwards classification) retrospectively.
Methods: 
From February 2006 to March 2012, a total of 21 patients with type II/IIA Hangman's fractures combined with intervertebral disc injury underwent ACDF with PEEK cage, and 28 patients underwent ACDF with plating. Perioperative parameters were compared. The average follow-up period was 50.3 months (range 27-76 months). The clinical outcome (visual analog scale (VAS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale, and clinical post-traumatic neck score (PTNC)) and radiological outcome (translation of C2, local kyphotic angle (LKA), and fusion status of C2/3) was compared retrospectively.
Results: 
The operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the ACDF with cage group compared with that in the ACDF with plating group (P < 0.05). All patients showed neurological recovery and achieved solid fusion. There were no significant differences in the clinical and radiological outcomes at final follow-up between groups, except in the LKA and the correction loss rate of LKA which were higher in the ACDF with plating group (P < 0.05). Donor-site pain occurred in two patients (10.1%) within 6 months after operation in the ACDF with plating group and none in the ACDF with cage group. All patients recovered without any adverse effects.
Conclusions: 
ACDF with PEEK cage is effective and reliable in management of type II/IIA Hangman's fractures and is more cost-effective due to shorter operative time and less blood loss requirements.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE Type II odontoid fracture is a common injury among elderly patients, particularly given their predisposition toward low-energy falls. Previous studies have demonstrated a survival advantage following early surgery among patients older than 65 years, yet octogenarians represent a medically distinct and rapidly growing population. The authors compared operative and nonoperative management in patients older than 79 years. METHODS A single-center prospectively maintained trauma database was reviewed using ICD-9 codes to identify octogenarians with C-2 cervical fractures between 1998 and 2014. Cervical CT images were independently reviewed by blinded neurosurgeons to confirm a Type II fracture pattern. Prospectively recorded outcomes included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), additional cervical fracture, and cord injury. Primary end points were mortality at 30 days and at 1 year. Statistical tests included the Student t-test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier test, and Cox proportional hazard. RESULTS A total of 111 patients met inclusion criteria (94 nonoperative and 17 operative [15 posterior and 2 anterior]). Mortality data were available for 100% of patients. The mean age was 87 years (range 80-104 years). Additional cervical fracture, spinal cord injury, GCS score, AIS score, and ISS were not associated with either management strategy at the time of presentation. The mean time to death or last follow-up was 22 months (range 0-129 months) and was nonsignificant between operative and nonoperative groups (p = 0.3). Overall mortality was 13% in-hospital, 26% at 30 days, and 41% at 1 year. Nonoperative and operative mortality rates were not significant at any time point (12% vs 18%, p = 0.5 [in-hospital]; 27% vs 24%, p = 0.8 [30-day]; and 41% vs 41%, p = 1.0 [1-year]). Kaplan-Meier analysis did not demonstrate a survival advantage for either management strategy. Spinal cord injury, GCS score, AIS score, and ISS were significantly associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality; however, Cox modeling was not significant for any variable. Additional cervical fracture was not associated with increased mortality. The rate of nonhome disposition was not significant between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Type II odontoid fracture is associated with high morbidity among octogenarians, with 41% 1-year mortality independent of intervention-a dramatic decrease from actuarial survival rates for all 80-, 90-, and 100-year-old Americans. Poor outcome is associated with spinal cord injury, GCS score, AIS score, and ISS.},

  abstract={Background context: 
There has been no study regarding the comparison between vertebroplasty and conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture.
Purpose: 
To compare the results of vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation with that of conservative treatment alone.
Study design: 
A case-control study.
Methods: 
The vertebroplasty group included 40 consecutive patients with primary osteoporotic burst fracture who underwent vertebroplasty using calcium phosphate cement, and the control group was made up of 40 patients given conservative treatment alone who were matched for age, gender, the injury level, and the type of fracture. Two groups of patients who had no neural deficit were prospectively examined. Clinical and radiological outcomes of these two groups were compared blindly. The authors do not report any conflict of interest in this study.
Outcome measures: 
Outcome measures included visual analog scale (VAS) of the back pain, analgesic requirements, and mobility; in a lateral radiograph, the deformity index was measured and expressed as the ratio of the vertebral body (VB) height (sum of measurements at anterior, middle, and posterior regions of VB) to the longitudinal diameter of VB. Anteroposterior height comparison was expressed as the percentage of VB height at the anterior region compared with the height at the posterior region. Each recovery rate was calculated as a percentage by the formula: (value at the examination-value before treatment)/value before treatment × 100.
Results: 
The duration of follow-up was more than 12 months (mean; 22.5 months). The mean VAS at 12 months after injury was 2.17 cm in the conservative group and 0.61 cm in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0002). The mean duration of analgesic medication required was 157.2 days in the conservative group and 21.3 days in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0048). The mean deformity index at 12 months after injury was 1.66 in the vertebroplasty group and 1.38 in the control group, and the mean recovery rate was +7.3% and -18.4%, respectively (p<.0001). Anteroposterior height comparison at 12 months after injury was 49.1% in the conservative group and 71.2% in the vertebroplasty group, and the mean recovery rate was -26.4% and +30.1%, respectively (p<.0001). One fracture in the vertebroplasty group showed delayed union until 6 months after injury. In the control group, there were six delayed union including four pseudoarthroses at over 6 months after injury that caused leg pain and were treated by conservative therapy.
Conclusions: 
We conclude that vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation provided a better clinical and radiological result than conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is the leading cause of disability and morbidity in elderly people. Treatment of this condition remains a challenge. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can be managed with various approaches, but each has limitations. In this study, we compared the clinical outcomes obtained using short-segment fixation with intravertebral expandable pillars (I-VEP) to those obtained with percutaneous kyphoplasty in patients who had suffered vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
The study included 46 patients with single-level osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures. Twenty-two patients in Group I underwent short-segment fixation with I-VEP and 24 patients in Group II underwent kyphoplasty. All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively using a visual analogue scale, anterior height of the fractured vertebra, and kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra. The latter 2 radiological parameters were measured at the adjacent segments as well.
Results: 
There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender or fracture level, but the mean age was greater in Group II patients (p = 0.008). At the 1-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in the visual analogue scale scores, anterior height of the fractured vertebra, or the value representing anterior height above the fractured vertebra and kyphotic angle below the fractured vertebra, after adjusting for the patients' gender, fracture level, and age. When considered separately, the anterior height below the fractured vertebra was significantly higher and the kyphotic angle above the fractured vertebra was significantly smaller in Group I than in Group II (p = 0.029 and p = 0.008, respectively). The kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra was significantly smaller in Group II than in Group I (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
In older individuals with vertebral compression fractures, kyphoplasty restored and maintained the collapsed vertebral body with less kyphotic deformity than that induced by short-segment fixation with I-VEP. Short-segment fixation with I-VEP was more effective in maintaining the integrity of adjacent segments, which prevented the domino effect often observed in patients with osteoporotic kyphotic spines.},

  abstract={To enhance the fusion of graft bone in thoracolumbar vertebrae and minimize the postoperative loss of correction, short-segment pedicle screw fixation was reinforced with posterior morselized bone grafting in vertebrae for spinal fusion in patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures. Seventy patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures were treated by short-segment pedicle screw fixation and were randomly divided into two groups. Fractures in group A (n=20) were reinforced with posterior morselized bone grafting in vertebrae for spinal fusion, while patients group B (n=50) did not receive the morselized bone grafting for bone fusion. The two groups were compared in terms of kyphotic deformity, anterior vertebral height, instrument failure and neurological functions after the treatment. Frankel grading system was used for the evaluation of neurological evaluation and Denis scoring scale was employed for pain assessment. The results showed that the kyphosis correction was achieved in both group A and group B (group A: 6.4 degree; group B: 5.4 degree)/ At the end of follow-up, kyphosis correction was maintained in group A but lost in group B (P=0.0001). Postoperatively, greater anterior height was achieved in group A than in group B (P<0.01). During follow-up study, anterior vertebral height was maintained only in Group A (P<0.001). Both group A and group B showed good Denis pain scores (P1 and P2) but group A outdid group B in terms of control of severe and constant pain (P4 and P5). By Frankel criteria, the changes in neurological functions in group A was better than those of group B (P<0.001). It is concluded that reinforcement of short-segment pedicle fixation with morselized bone grafting for the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture could achieve and maintain kyphosis correction, and it may also increase and maintain anterior vertebral height. Morselized bone grafting in vertebrae offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures, decreases the instrument failure and provides better postoperative pain control than without the morselized bone grafting.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the effective of short-segment pedicle instrumentation with bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting in injured vertebra and cross segment pedicle instrumentation with bone grafting in injured vertebra for treating thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 40 patients with thoracolumbar fracture who were in accordance with the inclusive criteria between June 2010 and June 2012. Of 40 patients, 20 received treatment with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation with bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting in injured vertebra in group A, and 20 received treatment with cross segment pedicle instrumentation with bone grafting in injured vertebra in group B. There was no significant difference in gender, age, affected segment, disease duration, Frankel grade, Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior verterbral height, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score between 2 groups before operation (P > 0.05). The operation time, blood loss, Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior vertebral height, loss of disc space height, Frankel grade, VAS and JOA scores were compared between 2 groups.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in the operation time and blood loss between 2 groups (P > 0.05). Primary healing of incision was obtained in all patients, and no early complication of infection or lower limb vein thrombus occurred. Forty patients were followed up 12-16 months (mean, 14.8 months). No breaking or displacement of internal fixation was observed. The improvement of Frankel grading score was 0.52 +/- 0.72 in group A and 0.47 +/- 0.63 in group B, showing no significant difference (t = 0.188, P = 0.853) at 12 months after operation. The Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior verterbral height, and VAS score at 1 week and 12 months, and JOA score at 12 months were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones in 2 groups (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in Cobb angle, disc space height, VAS score, and JOA score between 2 groups at each time point (P > 0.05), but the compression rate of anterior verterbral height in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (P < 0.05). The loss of disc space height next to the internal fixation or the injured vertebra was observed in 2 groups at 12 months, but showing no significant difference (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Compared with cross segment pedicle instrumentation, short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation with bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting in injured vertebra can recover and maintain the affected vertebra height in treating thoracolumbar fractures, but it could not effectively prevent degeneration of adjacent segments and the loss of kyphosis correction degree.},

  abstract={Background context: 
When used to fixate traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures, pedicle screw constructs may fail in the presence of severe vertebral body comminution as the intervertebral disc can creep through the fractured endplates leading to insufficient anterior column support. Balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and subsequent calcium phosphate cement augmentation may prevent this event by restoring the disc space boundaries. The results of the first studies using BAER after pedicle screw fixation are encouraging, showing good fracture reduction, few complications, and minimal loss of correction at 2 years of follow-up.
Purpose: 
To present the clinical and radiological outcome of 20 patients treated for traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures with pedicle screws and BAER after a minimum of 6 years follow-up.
Study design: 
Prospective trial.
Patient sample: 
Twenty consecutive neurologically intact adult patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were included.
Outcome measures: 
Radiological parameters (wedge/Cobb angle on plain radiographs and mid-sagittal anterior/central vertebral body height on magnetic resonance imaging scans) and patient reported parameters (EQ-5D and Oswestry Disability Index) were used.
Methods: 
All patients had previously undergone pedicle screw fixation and BAER with calcium phosphate cement augmentation. The posterior instrumentation was removed approximately 1.5 years after index surgery. Radiographs were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, after removal of the pedicle screws, and at final follow-up (minimum 6 years post-trauma). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained preoperatively, 1 month after index surgery, and 1 month after pedicle screw removal. Health questionnaires were filled out during the last outpatient visit.
Results: 
The pedicle screw instrumentation was removed uneventfully in all patients and posterolateral fusion was observed in every case. The mean wedge and Cobb angle converged to almost identical values (5.3° and 5.8°, respectively) and the mid-sagittal anterior and central endplates were reduced to approximately 90% and 80% of the estimated preinjury vertebral body height, respectively; this reduction was sustained at follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes showed favorable results in 79% of the patients. One patient required (posterior) reoperation due to adjacent osteoporotic vertebral body collapse after pedicle screw removal.
Conclusions: 
Balloon-assisted endplate reduction is a safe and low-demanding adjunct to pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. It may help achieve minimal residual deformity and reduce the number of secondary (anterior) procedures. Despite these positive findings, one in five patients experienced daily discomfort and disability.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Percutaenous Vertebroplasty (PVP) is effective in alleviating pain and facilitating early mobilization following vertebral compression fractures. The relatively high risk of extravertebral leakage due to uncontrolled delivery of low viscosity bone cement is an inherent limitation of the technique. The aim of this research is to investigate the ability of controlled cement delivery in decreasing the rate of such complications by applying radiofrequency heating to regulate cement viscosity.
Method and material: 
Thirty two vetebrae were treated in 28 patients as part of an Ethics Committee approved multicenter clinical trial using RadioFreqency assisted Percutaenous Vertebral Augmentation (RF-PVA) technique. This technique is injecting low viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement using a pressure controlled hydraulic pump and applying radiofrequency heating to increase cement viscosity prior to entering the vertebral body. All patients were screened for any cement leakage by X-ray and CT scan. The intensity of pain was recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the level of physical activity on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) prior to, one day, one month and three months following procedure.
Results: 
All procedures were technically successful. There were no clinical complication, intraspinal or intraforaminal cement leakage. In nine cases (29%) a small amount of PMMA entered the intervertebral space through the broken end plate. Intensity of pain by VAS was reduced from a mean of 7.0 to 2.5 and physical inactivity dropped on the ODI from 52% to 23% three months following treatment.
Conclusion: 
In this small series controlled cement injection using RF-PVA was capable of preventing clinically hazardous extravertebral cement leakage while achieving outcomes similar to that of conventional vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Background: 
The treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has historically been limited to several weeks of bed rest, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, calcitonin injections, or external bracing. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body) is a relatively new procedure used to treat these fractures. There is increasing interest to examine the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty and to study the possibility of a placebo effect or whether the pain relief is from local anesthetics placed directly on the bone during the vertebroplasty procedure.
Methods::Designs: 
Our goal is to test the hypothesis that patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who undergo vertebroplasty have less disability and pain at 1 month than patients who undergo a control intervention. The control intervention is placement of local anesthesia near the fracture, without placement of cement. One hundred sixty-six patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures will be recruited over 5 years from US and foreign sites performing the vertebroplasty procedure. We will exclude patients with malignant tumor deposit (multiple myeloma), tumor mass or tumor extension into the epidural space at the level of the fracture. We will randomly assign participants to receive either vertebroplasty or the control intervention. Subjects will complete a battery of validated, standardized measures of pain, functional disability, and health related quality of life at baseline and at post-randomization time points (days 1, 2, 3, and 14, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12). Both subjects and research interviewers performing the follow-up assessments will be blinded to the randomization assignment. Subjects will have a clinic visit at months 1 and 12. Spine X-rays will be obtained at the end of the study (month 12) to determine subsequent fracture rates. Our co-primary outcomes are the modified Roland score and pain numerical rating scale at 1 month.
Discussion: 
Although extensively utilized throughout North America for palliation of pain, vertebroplasty still has not undergone rigorous study. The study outlined above represents the first randomized, controlled study that can account for a placebo effect in the setting of vertebroplasty.

  abstract={Introduction: 
Kyphoplasty and percutaneous vertebroplasty are two effective procedures for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, but there have been few publications on their use in non-osteoporotic forms. B-Twin(®) vertebral body reconstruction is a new minimally invasive vertebral body reconstruction technique developed for non-osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and lumbar spine.
Objectives: 
The present study describes this novel technique and assessed efficacy compared to a conservative method.
Patients and methods: 
Inclusion criteria were: Magerl type A1.2 non-osteoporotic thoracolumbar or lumbar spinal compression fractures in patients aged over 18 years, free of neurologic compromise. Patients were randomized to management by corset (group 1) or by the B-Twin(®) spacer (group 2). Follow-up used a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and, on radiology, the vertebral (VK) and regional (RK) kyphosis angles and anterior and medial height indices at baseline, 3 months and 12 months.
Results: 
Group 1 comprised 26 patients; group 2 comprised 24 patients, with 44 implants. In group 1, mean VK was 10.7° (± 1.73°) at baseline, 11.9° (± 1.56°) at 3 months and 12.3° (± 1.6°) at 12 months. Mean RK was respectively 9.7° (± 0.97°), 11.10° (± 1.07°) and 11.8° (± 1.27). Mean medial height (medial-to-posterior [MH/PH] height ratio was respectively 0.75 [±0.05], 0.70 [±0.06] and 0.65 [±0.04]). Mean anterior height (anterior-to-posterior [AH/PH] height ratio) was respectively 0.79 [± 0.06], 0.76 [± 0.05] and 0.73 [± 0.05]). Mean VAS score was respectively 8.6 (± 0.52), 3.8 (± 0.82) and 2.3 (± 0.83). In group 2, mean VK was 13.8° (± 0.47°) at baseline, 4.88° (± 0.65°) at 3 months and 4.88° (± 0.65°). Mean RK was respectively 9.82° (± 1.67°), 4.47° (± 0.86°) and 4.82° (± 0.98°). Mean MH/PH ratio was respectively 0.69 (± 0.05), 0.86 (± 0.03) and 0.86 (± 0.03). Mean AH/PH ratio was respectively 0.73 (± 0.04), 0.90 (± 0.03) and 0.90 (± 0.03). Mean VAS score was 8.88 (± 0.47) at baseline, 2 (± 1) at 1-day post-surgery, 1.71 (± 0.88) at 3 months and 1.12 (± 0.23) at 12 months. The increase in vertebral body height in patients managed by B-Twin(®) was maintained at 6 and 12 months (P<0.0001). The study showed better results with the vertebral spacer than on conservative treatment, with a 95% reduction in bed-rest: 4-6 weeks in the conservative group vs. 2-3 days in the surgical group.
Conclusions: 
The vertebral body reconstruction technique provided anatomic vertebral body reconstruction and quick return to household activity without resort to a corset. Deformity was durably reduced. At 12-month follow-up, pain reduction and stasis were achieved. The risk of injected cement leakage was slight.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate bone metabolism, bone density (BMD) and vertebral fractures in morbidly obese individuals.
Subjects and methods: 
Case series of 29 premenopausal obese patients, 15 of whom had been submitted to bariatric surgery. Serum calcium, albumin, PTH and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) were measured as well as bone densitometry of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, and lateral spine x-rays.
Results: 
High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were recorded in 46.6% of the surgical patients and in 21.4% of the non-surgical patients (p = 0.245); 26.7% of the former and 28.6% of the latter revealed levels 25OHD < 30 ng/mL (p = 1.000). Calcium intake was higher in the surgical group (p = 0.004) along with lower serum calcium concentrations (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences in bone mineral density (BMD) or in the prevalence of vertebral fractures between groups.
Conclusion: 
In premenopausal women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass there is important intestinal calcium mal absorption which seems to be the main factor causing secondary hyperparathyroidism.},

Patients with age of 16-60 years, complete radiographs, early surgical treatment surgery, and follow-up (F/U) > 18 months were included and strict exclusion criteria applied. Regional and thoracolumbar kyphosis angles (RKA and TLA) were measured preoperatively and at final F/U, as were parameters of the spinopelvic sagittal alignment. Clinical outcomes were assessed using validated measures. Results. 36 patients with age mean age of 39 years and F/U of 69 months were included. 61% of patients were treated with bisegmental posterior instrumentation (POST-I) and 39% with combined posteroanterior instrumented fusion (PA-F). At F/U, several indicators for clinical outcomes showed a significant correlation with radiographic measures in the overall cohort with inferior clinical outcomes corresponding with increasing residual deformity and sagittal malalignment. Statistical analysis failed to reach level of significance for the differences between POST-I and PA-F group at final F/U. Only a strong trend towards better restoration of the thoracolumbar alignment was observed for the PA-F group in terms of the RKA and TLA. Conclusions.

  abstract={A review of the current literature reveals no systematic analyses of the results of surgical correction of spinal deformity after pediatric organ transplantation. We therefore evaluated clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal deformity correction after solid organ transplantation in childhood and adolescence. All 211 cases of heart, liver, and kidney transplantations performed in children in our country were reviewed. Six patients had undergone surgical correction of spinal deformity at a mean age 14.6 (range 12-17) years. Clinical data of the patients were evaluated. Radiographs of the whole spine were taken preoperatively, immediately after, at 2-year, and final follow-up visits. The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) questionnaire was completed and a physical examination was performed at the final follow-up visit. The mean follow-up after spinal surgery was 4.9 years (range 2-7.6 years). Four patients developed scoliosis after organ transplantation without any evidence of scoliosis prior to organ transplantation. One patient with congenital scoliosis was operated on after kidney transplantation. One boy had osteoporosis and severe local kyphosis due to vertebral compression fractures. Four patients underwent anterior and posterior surgery, two posterior only. The mean preoperative Cobb angle of the thoracic curve was 54 degrees (range 42-69 degrees) in the patients with scoliosis. The postoperative values were 30 degrees (26-38 degrees) immediately after instrumentation and 39 degrees (34-42 degrees) at the final follow-up visit. The patient with vertebral compression fractures and progressive kyphosis had 70 degrees curve before surgery, 23 degrees immediately after the operation, and 60 degrees at the final check up. The mean total score on the SRS questionnaire was 95.5 (range 90-101). There is a relatively high incidence (2.8%) of spinal deformities needing operative treatment after solid organ transplantation. Possible etiologies for spinal deformities are growth disturbance and muscle weakness due to the basic disease. The other important factors are related to immunosuppressive medication, especially glucocorticoids needed after transplantation. Primary correction of these deformities was satisfactory, but during follow-up, a certain amount of recurrence of the curves was evident. Poor bone quality may explain some of the loss of correction.},

  abstract={Background: 
The objectification of pain is essential for evaluation, treatment plan and follow-up; therefore, it is necessary to find reliable clinical parameters.
Objective: 
The goal of the study was the preoperative screening of a neuropathic component in patients with vertebral compression fracture (WKF), herniated disc (NPP) or spinal cord compression (SKS).
Material and methods: 
Depending on the preoperative condition on admittance, patients were classified into three groups: group 1 WKF, group 2 NPP and group 3 SKS. To characterize the pain we used the painDETECT questionnaire, the Oswestry questionnaire and further questionnaires. All patients were surgically treated according to the diagnosis, e.g. radiofrequency kyphoplasty, nucleotomy or spondylodesis.
Results: 
We evaluated the data from 139 patients (45% WKF, 34% NPP and 21% SKS). There were no differences in preoperative pain intensity (median ordinal scale 0-10) with a mean preoperative score of 7 for all groups. The total score of the painDETECT questionnaire showed significantly higher results in group 2 (median 18) and in group 3 (median 14) than in group 1 (median 9). There was even a significant difference between groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.03). The highest pain intensity was detected in group 1 with a median visual analog scale (VAS) of 71 mm. The total scores in the painDETECT questionnaire and the scores in the Oswestry questionnaire correlated in groups 2 and 3.
Conclusion: 
The painDETECT questionnaire was shown to be a very suitable instrument for evaluating the neuropathic pain component in patients with dorsalgia. This could be very useful in planning further therapy.},

  abstract={Background: 
Up to one third of BKP treated cases shows no appreciable height restoration due to loss of both restored height and kyphotic realignment after balloon deflation. This shortcoming has called for an improved method that maintains the height and realignment reached by the fully inflated balloon until stabilization of the vertebral body by PMMA-based cementation. Restoration of the physiological vertebral body height for pain relief and for preventing further fractures of adjacent and distant vertebral bodies must be the main aim for such a method. A new vertebral body stenting system (VBS) stabilizes the vertebral body after balloon deflation until cementation. The radiographic and safety results of the first 100 cases where VBS was applied are presented.
Methods: 
During the planning phase of an ongoing international multicenter RCT, radiographic, procedural and followup details were retrospectively transcribed from charts and xrays for developing and testing the case report forms. Radiographs were centrally assessed at the institution of the first/senior author.
Results: 
100 patients (62 with osteoporosis) with a total of 103 fractured vertebral bodies were treated with the VBS system. 49 were females with a mean age of 73.2 years; males were 66.7 years old. The mean preoperative anterior-middle-posterior heights were 20.3-17.6-28.0 mm, respectively. The mean local kyphotic angle was 13.1°. The mean preoperative Beck Index (anterior edge height/posterior edge height) was 0.73, the mean alternative Beck Index (middle height/posterior edge height) was 0.63. The mean postoperative heights were restored to 24.5-24.6-30.4 mm, respectively. The mean local kyphotic angle was reduced to 8.9°. The mean postoperative Beck Index was 0.81, the mean alternative one was 0.82. The overall extrusion rate was 29.1%, the symptomatic one was 1%. In the osteoporosis subgroup there were 23.8% extrusions. Within the three months followup interval there were 9% of adjacent and 4% of remote new fractures, all in the osteoporotic group.
Conclusions: 
VBS showed its strengths especially in realignment of crush and biconcave fractures. Given that fracture mobility is present, the realignment potential is sound and increases with the severity of preoperative vertebral body deformation.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To examine the incidence and characteristics of key spinopelvic parameters that are correlated with sacral fracture development after lumbosacral fusion.
Summary of background data: 
Sacral fracture is a possible complication of instrumented lumbosacral fusion and this has recently been documented in the literature. Preoperative awareness of risk factors concerning spinopelvic parameters and sacral fracture may aid in surgical planning to prevent its occurrence.
Methods: 
All patients who underwent instrumented lumbosacral fusion from L2 or above, between 2010 and 2011 at Gakkentoshi Hospital, were included.
Results: 
A total of 116 patients (47 men and 69 women) were evaluated in this study. Average age at surgery was 71 years, and the average follow-up period was 19 months. The average number of fixed segments was 5, and the average time interval between index surgery and sacral fracture development was 42 days. Notably, sacral fractures were identified in 5 patients (4.3%), all of whom were women. We, therefore, compared the 2 groups of female patients (fracture group, n = 5 vs. nonfracture group, n = 64). The fracture group had a substantially higher mean pelvic incidence (PI) than the nonfracture group (72° ± 8° vs. 51° ± 12°, respectively, P < 0.01). The fracture group also had a larger postoperative lumbar lordosis (LL)-PI mismatch than the nonfracture group (-26° ± 7° vs. -7° ± 18°, respectively, P < 0.01).
Conclusion: 
The current review of our patients informs appropriate preoperative planning in cases involving lumbosacral fusion for postmenopausal women with a high PI. Surgeons should plan to achieve large increases in LL to restore not only spinopelvic harmony but also to avoid postoperative sacral fracture. For such patients, because it is difficult to consistently achieve a sufficiently large LL, we recommend prophylactic iliosacral fixation to protect the sacrum.

  abstract={Background: 
Improved understanding of rod fracture (RF) in adult spinal deformity could be valuable for implant design, surgical planning, and patient counseling.
Objective: 
To evaluate symptomatic RF after posterior instrumented fusion for adult spinal deformity.
Methods: 
A multicenter, retrospective review of RF in adult spinal deformity was performed. Inclusion criteria were spinal deformity, age older than 18 years, and more than 5 levels posterior instrumented fusion. Rod failures were divided into early (≤12 months) and late (>12 months).
Results: 
Of 442 patients, 6.8% had symptomatic RF. RF rates were 8.6% for titanium alloy, 7.4% for stainless steel, and 2.7% for cobalt chromium. RF incidence after pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) was 15.8%. Among patients with a PSO and RF, 89% had RF at or adjacent to the PSO. Mean time to early RF (63%) was 6.4 months (range, 2-12 months). Mean time to late RF (37%) was 31.8 months (range, 14-73 months). The majority of RFs after PSO (71%) were early (mean, 10 months). Among RF cases, mean sagittal vertical axis improved from preoperative (163 mm) to postoperative (76.9 mm) measures (P<.001); however, 16 had postoperative malalignment (sagittal vertical axis>50 mm; mean, 109 mm).
Conclusion: 
Symptomatic RF occurred in 6.8% of adult spinal deformity cases and in 15.8% of PSO patients. The rate of RF was lower with cobalt chromium than with titanium alloy or stainless steel. Early failure was most common after PSO and favored the PSO site, suggesting that RF may be caused by stress at the PSO site. Postoperative sagittal malalignment may increase the risk of RF.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective case-control study.
Objective: 
To determine the association of Hounsfield unit (HU) measurements with adjacent segment fractures after spinal fusion.
Summary of background data: 
Adjacent segment fracture is a potentially devastating complication after spinal fusion surgery in osteoporotic patient. Recently, a technique for assessing bone mineral density using HU measurements from computed tomography was described and correlated with both dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-assessed bone mineral density and compressive strength in an osseous model.
Methods: 
Patients with adjacent segment fractures after spinal fusion were identified from a prospectively collected patient database and matched 1:1 with nonfracture controls on the basis of age, sex, and fusion construct. Minimum follow-up was 6 months. Patients with metabolic bone disease other than osteoporosis or those taking medications known to negatively alter bone strength were excluded. HU assessment was done according to the previously published protocol using the preoperative computed tomography.
Results: 
Twenty patients had complete imaging data and could be matched to nonfracture controls. The groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, body mass index, and number of levels fused. Following the index surgical procedure, the fracture group had more positive sagittal balance than the control group (10.7 cm vs. 9.1 cm). Analysis of HU values at the fracture level showed a significantly lower value in the fracture group than in the controls (145.6 vs. 199.4, P = 0.006). Similarly, global assessment of HU across the thoracic and lumbar spines was significantly lower in the fracture group (139.9 vs. 170.1, P = 0.032).
Conclusion: 
HU was significantly lower both locally and globally in the fracture cohort. Because computed tomographic scans are frequently part of preoperative planning for spinal fusion, this information should be incorporated in preoperative planning. Studies to prospectively validate HU as a predictor of adjacent segment fracture risk and to assess the effect of increasing HU preoperatively with medications for osteoporosis are needed.

Prospective trial of virtual endoscopy in spinal surgery.
Objective: 
To investigate the utility of virtual endoscopy of the spine in conjunction with spinal surgery.
Summary of background data: 
Several studies have described clinical applications of virtual endoscopy to visualize the inside of the bronchi, paranasal sinus, stomach, small intestine, pancreatic duct, and bile duct, but, to date, no study has described the use of virtual endoscopy in the spine.
Methods: 
Virtual endoscopy is a realistic 3-dimensional intraluminal simulation of tubular structures that is generated by postprocessing of computed tomographic data sets. Five patients with spinal disease were selected: 2 patients with degenerative disease, 2 patients with spinal deformity, and 1 patient with spinal injury.
Results: 
Virtual endoscopy software allows an observer to explore the spinal canal with a mouse, using multislice computed tomographic data. Our study found that virtual endoscopy of the spine has advantages compared with standard imaging methods because surgeons can noninvasively explore the spinal canal in all directions.
Conclusion: 
Virtual endoscopy of the spine may be useful to surgeons for diagnosis, preoperative planning, and postoperative assessment by obviating the need to mentally construct a 3-dimensional picture of the spinal canal from 2-dimensional computed tomographic scans.},

Spinal surgeons must become familiar with the vertebral morphometry of patients with SCD and to that aim we have examined the morphometry of the thoracolumbar spine in these patients. A cohort of 100 patients with SCD was examined using plain thoraco lumbar anteroposterior/lateral radiographs and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Vertebral morphometry (vertebral body diameters, pedicle, spinal canal and deformity) was assessed for different age groups. Results were compared to published studies of healthy subjects. The vertebral dimensions for the 16-20-year and the 21+-year-old groups were significantly smaller for females than males at most spinal levels, while measurements in the 6-10 years and 11-15 years age groups were similar across both sexes at most levels. No significant statistical difference was found between the diameters of the right and left pedicles. With the exception of the sagittal diameter, most of the dimensions of the vertebral bodies measured in SCD patients were less than those of healthy individuals; multiple deformities were also observed. Low bone density was noted in 32 patients. Our data highlight the differences in vertebral bone mineral density, anatomy and deformities in patients with SCD compared to healthy individuals. When considering surgical intervention for patients with SCD, it is important that pre-operative radiography and planning is undertaken, and that the surgeon is familiar with the geometry of the pedicles of the thoracolumbar vertebrae necessary for the safe insertion of pedicle screws. Osteoporosis must be considered when planning surgical interventions in these patients.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The success of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) depends greatly on preprocedural evaluation of the patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of preprocedural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the indications of PVP.
Materials and methods: 
A retrospective review of 122 osteoporotic compression fractures in 63 patients who underwent preprocedural gadolinium-enhanced MRI and PVP was performed. Based on the extent of contrast enhancement on preprocedural MRI, each case was classified into one of two groups: group 1, which represented more than 50% of the vertebral body enhanced; and group 2, which represented less than 50% of the vertebral body enhanced. The most enhancing level was evaluated in multilevel PVP sessions. We evaluated the difference of pre- and postprocedural pain scales between groups 1 and 2 using Mann-Whitney's U-test.
Results: 
There was a trend toward higher preoperative pain score in group 1, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.0537). In addition, the postoperative pain score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 (P = 0.0007). The difference between the pre- and postoperative pain scores was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0.0001).
Conclusion: 
Contrast enhancement on MRI indicates a painful lesion and extensive contrast enhancement predicts better pain relief after PVP.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which bone cement is injected into a fractured vertebra. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a variation of this approach, in which an inflatable balloon tamp is placed in the collapsed vertebra prior to cement injection.
Objectives: 
To systematically evaluate and appraise the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PVP and percutaneous BKP in reducing pain and disability in people with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in England and Wales.
Data sources: 
A systematic review was carried out. Ten databases including MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception to November 2011, and supplemented by hand-searching relevant articles and contact with an expert. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with painful osteoporotic VCFs with a group receiving PVP or BKP. In addition, lead authors of identified RCTs were contacted for unpublished data.
Review methods: 
Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life; back-specific functional status/mobility; pain/analgesic use; vertebral body height and angular deformity; incidence of new vertebral fractures and progression of treated fracture. A manufacturer provided academic-in-confidence observational data indicating that vertebral augmentation may be associated with a beneficial mortality effect, and that, potentially, BKP was more efficacious than PVP. These data were formally critiqued. A mathematical model was constructed to explore the cost-effectiveness of BKP, PVP and operative placebo with local anaesthesia (OPLA) compared with optimal pain management (OPM). Six scenario analyses were conducted that assessed combinations of assumptions on mortality (differential beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; equal beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; and no effect assumed) and derivation of utility data (either mapped from visual analogue scale pain score data produced by a network meta-analysis or using direct European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions data from the trials). Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted on each of the six scenarios. This report contains reference to confidential information provided as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence appraisal process. This information has been removed from the report and the results, discussions and conclusions of the report do not include the confidential information. These sections are clearly marked in the report.
Results: 
A total of nine RCTs were identified and included in the review of clinical effectiveness. This body of literature was of variable quality, with the two double-blind, OPLA-controlled trials being at the least risk of bias. The most significant methodological issue among the remaining trials was lack of blinding for both study participants and outcome assessors. Broadly speaking, the literature suggests that both PVP and BKP provide substantially greater benefits than OPM in open-label trials. However, in double-blinded trials PVP was shown to have no more benefit than local anaesthetic; no trials of BKP compared with local anaesthesia have been conducted. A formal analysis of observational mortality data undertaken within this report concluded that it was not possible to say with certainty if there is a difference in mortality between patients undergoing BKP and PVP compared with OPM. Results from the cost-effectiveness analyses were varied, with all of BKP, PVP and OPLA appearing the most cost-effective treatment dependent on the assumptions made regarding mortality effects, utility, hospitalisation costs and OPLA costs.
Limitations: 
Data on key parameters were uncertain and/or potentially confounded, making definitive conclusions difficult to make.
Conclusion: 
For people with painful osteoporotic VCFs refractory to analgesic treatment, PVP and BKP perform significantly better in unblinded trials than OPM in terms of improving quality of life and reducing pain and disability. However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that either procedure performs better than OPLA. The uncertainty in the evidence base means that no definitive conclusion on the cost-effectiveness of PVP or BKP can be provided. Further research should focus on establishing whether or not BKP and PVP have a mortality advantage compared with OPLA and on whether or not these provide any utility gain compared with OPLA.

To date, there has been ongoing debate over whether intravertebral vacuum cleft (IVC) has the effect of therapeutic efficacy in percutaneous vertebral augmentation (PVA) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Objective: 
The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate a pooled estimate of the IVCs on the effect of therapeutic efficacy of PVA for the treatment of OVCFs.
Methods: 
A systematic electronic literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library; the databases were searched from the earliest available records up to June 2016. Pooled risk ratio (RR) or a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The RevMan 5.2 was used to analyze the data.
Results: 
In the immediate postoperative period, pooled results showed that vertebral height and VAS scores of the IVC patients were significantly lower than those of the non-IVC patients. However, pooled results showed there was no significant difference in kyphotic angle and ODI indices between the two groups. At final follow-up period, significant difference was observed in all the radiological and clinical parameters for the IVC patients with compared to the non-IVC patients in our pooled results. Pooled results showed significant difference with respect to the rate of cement leakage between the two groups.
Conclusion: 
The IVCs had an important effect of therapeutic efficacy in PVA for the treatment OVCFs. Therefore, we strongly recommend its strict observation and follow-up for the IVCs patients.},

  abstract={Aims: 
Loosening of pedicle screws is a major complication of posterior spinal stabilisation, especially in the osteoporotic spine. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of cement augmentation compared with extended dorsal instrumentation on the stability of posterior spinal fixation.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 12 osteoporotic human cadaveric spines (T11-L3) were randomised by bone mineral density into two groups and instrumented with pedicle screws: group I (SHORT) separated T12 or L2 and group II (EXTENDED) specimen consisting of T11/12 to L2/3. Screws were augmented with cement unilaterally in each vertebra. Fatigue testing was performed using a cranial-caudal sinusoidal, cyclic (1.0 Hz) load with stepwise increasing peak force.
Results: 
Augmentation showed no significant increase in the mean cycles to failure and fatigue force (SHORT p = 0.067; EXTENDED p = 0.239). Extending the instrumentation resulted in a significantly increased number of cycles to failure and a significantly higher fatigue force compared with the SHORT instrumentation (EXTENDED non-augmented + 76%, p < 0.001; EXTENDED augmented + 87%, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
The stabilising effect of cement augmentation of pedicle screws might not be as beneficial as expected from biomechanical pull-out tests. Lengthening the dorsal instrumentation results in a much higher increase of stability during fatigue testing in the osteoporotic spine compared with cement augmentation.

  abstract={Purpose: 
To compare clinical and radiological outcomes between short (SSPF) and long-segment (LSPF) posterior fixation for thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Retrospective review of adult patients, with single-level, TLJ (T11-L2) fractures, treated with posterior fixation between 2007 and 2014 at a regional spinal centre. SSPF and LSPF were defined as transpedicular screw fixation at one and two levels above and below the fractured vertebra, respectively. Construct failure was defined as instrument breakage or screw pull-out requiring operative intervention. Two independent assessors measured the kyphotic Cobb angle at up to six months.
Results: 
A total of 28 patients were included with a median age of 38 years (range 20-76 years) and median follow-up period of 14 months (4-41 months). All patients sustained traumatic fractures and the male to female ratio was 19:9. AO fracture classes were: A (29%), B (50%) and C (21%). SSPF and LSPF were performed in 17 (61%) and 11 (39%) patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in age (Fisher's exact, p > 0.99), AO fracture class (chi-squared, p = 0.510), preop TLICS score (independent t-test, p = 0.668) and length of stay (independent t-test, p = 0.106) between the groups. Construct failure occurred in three SSPF cases (3-14 months postop) and was associated with an increased mean loss of correction. By six months, the Cobb angle had increased significantly in the SSPF group (paired t-test, p = 0.049), but not the LSPF group (paired t-test, p = 0.157).
Conclusions: 
Our data identified a trend towards better clinical and radiological outcomes in the LSPF, compared to the SSPF group. Although supported by some studies, these findings should be evaluated in future clinical trials.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of anterior screw fixation and posterior temporary-fixation in the treatment of Anderson-D'Alonzo type II odontoid fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Posterior C1-C2 temporary-fixation can spare the motion of C1-C2 in the treatment of odontoid fractures. However, it is unknown whether it can achieve the same outcomes as anterior screw fixation.
Methods: 
Data of 20 patients who underwent posterior temporary-fixation due to Anderson-D'Alonzo type II odontoid fractures with intact transverse ligament were retrospectively reviewed. Another 20 patients undergoing anterior screw fixation were randomly selected as the control group. The range of motion (ROM) in rotation of C1-C2 measured on functional computed tomography (CT) scan and outcomes evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS) for neck pain, neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and neck disability index (NDI) were compared between two groups at the final follow-up.
Results: 
At the final follow-up, 19 cases in each groups achieved facture healing. Total C1-C2 ROM in rotation on both sides in the posterior temporary-fixation group was 32.4 ± 12.5°, smaller than 40.0 ± 13.0 in the anterior fixation group. However, there was no statistical difference between two groups. And there was no significant difference between two groups in functional outcomes evaluated by VAS for neck pain, neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and NDI.
Conclusion: 
Posterior temporary-fixation can spare the motion of C1-C2 and achieve same good clinical outcomes as anterior screw fixation in the treatment of Anderson-D'Alonzo type II odontoid fractures. It was an ideal alternative strategy to anterior screw fixation.

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture difficulty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture.
Introduction: 
This study is to evaluate the application and clinical outcomes of unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral PKP in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF).
Methods: 
A total of 56 cases with two levels thoracolumbar OVCF were randomly assigned for treatment with unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral PKP. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiologic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with mainly the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose and bone cement distribution.
Results: 
The operation was completed successfully in 56 cases. In the unilateral level, the operation time, the volume of the injected cement, and radiation dose were significantly less than bilateral level. All patients had significantly improvement on VAS score after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period. In the bilateral level, 7 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and effective treatments for patients with painful OVCF. But unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, offered a higher degree of deformity correction, and resulted in less complication than bilateral.},

  abstract={Background: 
Despite the known demographic shift with expected doubled rate of vertebral body fractures by the year 2050, a standardized treatment concept for traumatic and osteoporotic incomplete burst fracture of the truncal spine does not exist. This study aims to determine whether minimally invasive fracture care for incomplete osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures using intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages is a suitable procedure and may provide improved safety in terms of cement-associated complications in comparison to kyphoplasty procedure.
Methods: 
In 2011/2012, 15 patients (10 women, 5 men; mean age 77) with 15 incomplete osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures (T10 to L4) were stabilized using intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages (OsseoFix®) as part of a prospective study. X-ray, MRI and bone density measurements (DXA) were performed preinterventionally. The clinical and radiological results were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively and after 12 months according to the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), X-ray (Beck Index, Cobb angle) and CT analyses. Wilcoxon rank sum test, sign test and Fischer's exact test were used for statistical evaluation.
Results: 
A significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) from preoperative 8.0 to 1.6 after 12 months and significant improvement in activity level (ODI) from preoperative 79.0 to 30.5 % after 12 months were revealed. Radiologically, the mean kyphotic angle according to Cobb showed significant improvements from preoperative 9.1° to 8.0° after 12 months. A vertebral body subsidence was revealed in only one case (6.7 %). No changes in the position of the posterior wall were revealed. No cement leakage or perioperative complications were seen.
Conclusion: 
As a safe and effective procedure, the use of intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages presents a valuable alternative to usual intravertebral stabilization procedures for incomplete osteoporotic burst fractures and bears the potential to reduce cement-associated complications.

To review the research progress of the diagnosis and treatment of Hangman fracture.
Methods: 
The original articles about the diagnosis and treatment of Hangman fracture were extensively reviewed and analyzed.
Results: 
Not only X-ray, but also MRI and CT scans are necessory for the diagnosis and assessment of Hangman fractures. The treatment of unstable Hangman fracture included posterior C2, C3 fixation, anterior C2, C3 fixation, and anterior C2, C3 fixation combined with posterior C2 pedicle screw fixation. The anterior surgical fixation is used by the anterior retropharyngeal approach or subaxial anterior approach, and it has the advantages of directly resecting the injured C2, C3 discs, getting a satisfactory cervical spine alignment, and avoiding the postoperative axial pain. However, posterior surgical fixation using C2 pedicle screw has the risks of neurovascular injuries.
Conclusion: 
The surgical technique of Hangman fracture should be determined based on the patient's injury and surgeon's experience. Randomized control trials of different surgical techniques should be performed.},

Posterior C1-C2 temporary-fixation technique can spare the range of motion (ROM) of the atlantoaxial joint after odontoid fracture healing. However, few studies analyze the difference in clinical outcome between this technique and posterior C1-C2 fusion technique for new odontoid fracture.
Objective: 
To verify whether the clinical outcome of the posterior C1-C2 temporary-fixation technique is superior to that of the posterior C1-C2 fusion technique in the treatment of a new odontoid fracture.
Methods: 
Twenty-one of 22 patients who underwent posterior C1-C2 temporary fixation of an odontoid fracture achieved fracture healing and regained motion of the atlantoaxial joint. The functional outcomes of these 21 patients were compared with that of a control group, which consisted of 21 randomly enrolled cases with posterior C1-C2 fixation and fusion. The differences between the 2 groups in the visual analog scale score for neck pain, neck stiffness, Neck Disability Index, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and time to fracture healing were analyzed.
Results: 
Significantly better outcomes were observed in the temporary-fixation group for visual analog scale score for neck pain, Neck Disability Index, and neck stiffness. The outcomes in the temporary-fixation group was superior to those in the fusion group in all dimensions of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. There were no significant differences in fracture healing rate and time to fracture healing between the 2 techniques.
Conclusion: 
Functional outcomes were significantly better after posterior C1-C2 temporary fixation than after fusion. Temporary fixation can be used as a salvage treatment for an odontoid fracture with an intact transverse ligament in cases of failure of, or contraindication to, anterior screw fixation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Debate remains over the role of surgical treatment in minimally displaced lateral compression (Young-Burgess, LC, OTA 61-B1/B2) pelvic ring injuries. Lateral compression type 1 (LC1) injuries are defined by an impaction fracture at the sacrum; type 2 (LC2) are defined by a fracture that extends through the posterior iliac wing at the level of the sacroiliac joint. Some believe that operative stabilization of these fractures limits pain and eases mobilization, but to our knowledge there are few controlled studies on the topic.
Questions::Purposes: 
(1) Does operative stabilization of LC1 and LC2 pelvic fractures decrease patients' narcotic use and lower their visual analog scale pain scores? (2) Does stabilization allow patients to mobilize earlier with physical therapy?
Methods: 
This retrospective study of LC1 and LC2 fractures evaluated patients treated definitively at one institution from 2007 to 2013. All patients treated surgically, all nonoperative LC2, and all nonoperative LC1 fractures with complete sacral injury were included. In general, LC1 or LC2 fractures with greater than 10 mm of displacement and/or sagittal/axial plane deformity on static radiographs were treated surgically. One hundred fifty-eight patients in the LC1 group (107 [of 697 screened] nonoperative, 51 surgical) and 123 patients in the LC2 group (78 nonoperative, 45 surgical) met inclusion criteria. The surgical and nonoperative groups were matched for fracture type. To account for differences between patients treated surgically and nonoperatively, we used propensity modeling techniques incorporating treatment predictors. Propensity scores demonstrated good overlap and were used as part of multiple variable regression models to account for selection bias between the surgically treated and nonoperative groups. Patient-reported pain scores and narcotic administration were tallied in 24-hour increments during the first 24 hours of hospitalization, at 48 hours after intervention, and in the 24 hours before discharge. Time from intervention to mobilization out of bed was recorded; intervention was defined as the date of definitive surgical intervention or the day the surgeon determined the patient would be treated without surgery.
Results: 
There was no difference in the narcotics distributed to any of the groups with the exception that the patients with surgically treated LC2 fractures used, on average (mean [95% confidence interval]) 40.2 (-72.9 to -7.6) mg morphine less at the 48-hour mark (p = 0.016). In general, there were no differences between the groups' pain scores. The surgically treated patients with LC1 fractures mobilized 1.7 (-3.3 to -0.01) days earlier (p = 0.034) than their nonoperative counterparts. There was no difference in the LC2 cohort in terms of time to mobilization between those treated with and without surgery.
Conclusions: 
There were few differences in pain scores and morphine use between the surgical and nonoperative groups, and the differences observed likely were not clinically important. We found no evidence that surgical stabilization of certain LC1 and LC2 pelvic fractures improves patients' pain, decreases their narcotic use, and improves time to mobilization. A randomized trial of patients with similar fractures and similar degrees initial displacement would help remove some of the confounders present in this study.
Level of evidence: 
Level III, therapeutic study.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
There is a general consensus that unstable vertebral body fractures of the thoracolumbar junction with a B type fracture or a high load shear index need to be surgically stabilized, primarily by a dorsal approach. The authors believe that there are indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in cases of reduction loss or a relevant intervertebral disc lesion in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 weeks after dorsal stabilization. However, in cases of unstable vertebral fractures it remains unclear if a delayed anterior spondylodesis will lead to unacceptable loss of initial reduction.
Material and methods: 
A total of 59 patients were included in this study during 2013 and 2014. All patients suffered from a traumatic vertebral fracture of the thoracolumbar junction and were initially treated with a dorsal short segment stabilization. All vertebral body fractures had a load shear index of at least 5 or were B type fractures. An x-ray control was carried out after 2 and 6 weeks and MRI was additionally performed after 6 weeks. An additional ventral spondylodesis was recommended in patients showing a reduction loss of at least 5° and in patients with relevant intervertebral disc lesions. The extent of the reduction loss was analyzed. Other parameters of interest were the fracture level, fracture classification, patient age and surgical technique (e.g. implant, index screw, laminectomy and cement augmentation).
Results: 
The patient collective consisted of 23 women and 36 men (average age 51 years ± 17 years). The mean reduction loss was 5.1° (± 5.2°) after a mean follow-up of 60 days (± 56 days). The reduction loss was significantly higher when polyaxial implants were used compared to monoaxial dorsal fixators (10.8° versus 4.0°, p < 0.001). There was a significantly higher reduction loss in those patients who received a laminectomy (11.3° versus 4.3°, p = 0.01) but there were no significant differences if an index screw was used (4.5° versus 5.3°). Additionally, there was a significantly lower reduction in the subgroup of patients 60 years or older who were stabilized using cement-augmented screws (3.9° versus 11.3°, p = 0.02). The mean reduction loss was 2.8° (± 2.5°) in patients treated with a monoaxial implant, cement-augmented if 60 years or older and without laminectomy (n = 39). There was no significant correlation between reduction loss and the other parameters of interest, such as fracture morphology with classification according to the working group on questions of osteosynthesis (AO) and McCormack or fracture level.
Conclusion: 
Delayed indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures and initial dorsal stabilization will cause no relevant reduction loss if monoaxial implants are used and laminectomy can be avoided. Additionally, cement augmentation of the pedicle screws seems to be beneficial in patients 60 years of age or older.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Thoracolumbar junction burst fractures remain a challenging problem due to controversy over the treatment choice of short- or long-segment posterior fixation. The aim of the present study was to compare life quality and sexual function of patients after short- and long-segment posterior fixations in the treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.
Methods: 
In this prospective, randomized study, 24 sexually active male patients diagnosed with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures were randomly assigned to either the short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) group or the long-segment posterior fixation group (LLPF). The exclusion criteria were rheumatological disease and spinal surgery history. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index or smoking habits between the groups. The life quality score of EQ-5D and the International Index of erectile function (IIEF-5) score of male patients and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score of female partners were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.
Results: 
The mean age of patients in the SSPF and LSPF groups was 44.58 and 42.92 years, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the preoperative EQ-5D and IIEF-5 scores of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners. Postoperatively, the EQ-5D scores (p = 0.011) and IIEF-5 scores (p = 0.000) of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners (p = 0.001) were better in the short-segment group.
Conclusions: 
Patients treated with SSPF have better sexual function and life quality with their partners compared to those treated with LSPF. The main clinical relevance of this study is that the impact of the choice of short or long-segment treatment on postoperative sexual function and life quality should be considered by surgeons when performing posterior fixation after thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) typically involves conventional lower-viscosity cement injection via bipedicular approach. Limited evidence is available comparing the clinical outcomes and complications in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with PVP using high-viscosity cement through unipedicular or bipedicular approach.
Methods and design: 
Fifty patients with OVCFs were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unipedicular or bipedicular PVP. The efficacy of unipedicular and bipedicular PVP was assessed by comparing operation time, X-ray exposure time, incidence of complications, vertebral height restoration, and improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey scores.
Results: 
The mean operative and exposure time to X-rays in the unipedicular PVP group was less than that of the bipedicular group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the VAS score, ODI score, SF-36 score, cement leakage rate or vertebral height restoration between the two groups (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Unipedicular and bipedicular PVP are safe and effective treatments for OVCF. Compared with bipedicular PVP, unipedicular PVP entails a shorter surgical time and lower X-ray irradiation.},

  abstract={Object: 
Long-term follow-up study is required for verifying whether the clinical outcomes of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are altered. The authors' findings showed only subtle differences between these operations within a 5-year period. However, they still suggest the use of vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty in view of the treatment costs. In their previous study, the authors performed a short-term prospective comparison between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Vertebroplasty was recommended instead of kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) because of the subtle differences between this procedure and kyphoplasty and the treatment costs. To determine whether these clinical outcomes persist in the long term, they continued to observe the patients from their short-term study over a longer-term period. METHODS :One hundred cases of VCF were assigned randomly to either the kyphoplasty or the vertebroplasty group. In cement augmentation, the authors used polymethylmethacrylate as bone filler. Pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS). For each patient, vertebral body height and wedge angle were measured from reconstructed CT images.
Results: 
The duration of the follow-up period was 5 years. Vertebral body height, kyphotic wedge angle, and VAS score were not evidently altered. Eight patients in the kyphoplasty group had an adjacent fracture after the procedure, whereas 7 patients in the vertebroplasty group had an adjacent fracture after the procedure. These adjacent fractures occurred within 1 year of surgery in both treatment groups except in 1 kyphoplasty-treated patient in whom the adjacent fracture was noted 16 months after treatment. Three patients in the vertebroplasty group had a nonadjacent fracture, and 4 patients in the kyphoplasty group had a nonadjacent fracture. The link between angular correction and the occurrence of adjacent fracture was statistically significant in the vertebroplasty group.
Conclusions: 
Excessive angular correction is a critical concern in the risk of adjacent fracture after vertebroplasty. Given the subtle differences between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty observed over the course of 5 years, vertebroplasty remains the preferred option in view of the costs.},

  abstract={Background: 
With increasing human longevity there is increasing prevalence of osteoporosis and of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Most vertebral fractures do not require medical therapy for pain, but a minority are associated with severe pain and disability. Vertebroplasty has been used increasingly for painful acute osteoporotic fractures. The best available evidence for vertebroplasty is provided by two placebo controlled trials which showed no significant clinical benefit of vertebroplasty over placebo. These were not acute fracture trials with the majority of fractures in both trials being well beyond the acute time frame of 6 weeks. There is evidence from an open label randomized controlled trial of vertebroplasty versus conservative therapy in acute fractures suggesting clinical efficacy in acute vertebral fractures.
Methods: 
This is a blinded trial of Vertebroplasty for Acute Painful Osteoporotic fractURes - the VAPOUR trial. Patients greater than 60 years in age with new severe onset of back pain and osteoporotic vertebral fractures of less than 6 weeks duration will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive either vertebroplasty or a placebo procedure. Data regarding pain, disability, and quality of life will be collected over a 6-month period. The enrolled patients and the outcome assessors will remain blinded for the duration of the trial.
Discussion: 
The VAPOUR trial will apply similar methodology to the previous blinded trials but in a patient group with exclusively acute fractures and the most severe pain.

  abstract={Study design: 
The KAST (Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial) study was a pivotal, multicenter, randomized control trial for evaluation of safety and effectiveness in the treatment of patients with painful, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).
Objective: 
The objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of the Kiva system to balloon kyphoplasty (BK) with respect to the composite primary endpoint.
Summary of background data: 
Annual incidence of osteoporotic VCFs is prevalent. Optimal treatment of VCFs should address pain, function, and deformity. Kiva is a novel implant for vertebral augmentation in the treatment of VCFs.
Methods: 
A total of 300 subjects with 1 or 2 painful osteoporotic VCFs were randomized to blindly receive Kiva (n = 153) or BK (n = 147). Subjects were followed through 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite at 12 months defined as a reduction in fracture pain by at least 15 mm on the visual analogue scale, maintenance or improvement in function on the Oswestry Disability Index, and absence of device-related serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints included cement usage, extravasation, and adjacent level fracture.
Results: 
A mean improvement of 70.8 and 71.8 points in the visual analogue scale score and 38.1 and 42.2 points in the Oswestry Disability Index was noted in Kiva and BK, respectively. No device-related serious adverse events occurred. Despite significant differences in risk factors favoring the control group at baseline, the primary endpoint demonstrated noninferiority of Kiva to BK. Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed superiority with respect to cement use and site-reported extravasation and a positive trend in adjacent level fracture warranting further study.
Conclusion: 
The KAST study successfully established that the Kiva system is noninferior to BK based on a composite primary endpoint assessment incorporating pain-, function-, and device-related serious adverse events for the treatment of VCFs due to osteoporosis. Kiva was shown to be noninferior to BK and revealed a positive trend in several secondary endpoints.

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). But high cement leakage rate caused by a low-viscosity cement and high injection pressure has limited its general use. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and high-viscosity cement vertebroplasty (HVCV) are 2 modifications of vertebroplasty designed to decrease cement leakage.
Objective: 
To assess the safety and efficacy of HVCV compared with BKP.
Study design: 
A prospective cohort study.
Setting: 
Department of Spine Surgery, an affiliated hospital of a medical university.
Method: 
One hundred seven patients suffering from painful OVCFs were randomly assigned into HVCV or BKP groups. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), cement leakage, and vertebral height restoration were evaluated. All occurring complications and injected cement volumes were recorded. The follow-up time was one year.
Results: 
VAS and ODI scores improved in both groups, and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. More cement was used in the BKP group than in HVCV group (4.22 vs. 3.31 mL, P < 0.0001). The incidence of cement leakage in the HVCV group was lower than that of the BKP group (13.24% vs 30.56%, P < 0.05). No symptomatic cement leakages occurred in the HVCV group. In the BKP group, one patient experienced discogenic back pain related to a disc leak, and another patient had asymptomatic cement emboli in the lung related to venous leakage. The mean compression rate before the procedure was 29.98% in the HVCV group and 28.67% in the BKP group (P = 0.94). The vertebral height was improved significantly and maintained at one-year follow-up in both groups. BKP was more effective in vertebral height restoration than HVCV (44.87% vs. 23.93%, P < 0.0001). There was one case of a new adjacent vertebral fracture in the HVCV group (2%), and 4 cases of new nonadjacent vertebral fractures in the BKP group (7.84%) (P = 0.18).
Limitations: 
A single-center and relatively small-sample size study.
Conclusion: 
HVCV and BKP are safe and effective in improving quality of life and relieving pain. HVCV has a lower cement leakage rate, whereas BKP is more effective in vertebral height restoration. Subsequent fractures are not different between the 2 groups.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) affect 20% of people over the age of 70 with increasing incidence. Kypho-/vertebroplasty as standard operative procedures are associated with limitations like cement leakage, limited reduction capabilities, and risk for adjacent fractures. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new minimal invasive cementless VCF fixation technique.
Methods: 
Four patients (72.3 years, range 70-76) with VCFs type AO/Müller A1.3 and concomitant osteoporosis were treated by minimal invasive transpedicular placement of two intervertebral mesh cages for fracture reduction and maintenance. Follow-up included functional/radiological assessment and clinical scores and averaged 27.7 months (24-28).
Results: 
Endplate reduction was achieved in all cases (mean surgery time: 28.5 minutes). Kyphotic (KA) and Cobb angle revealed considerable improvements postoperatively (KA 14.5° to 10.7°/Cobb 10.1° to 8.3°). Slight loss of vertebral reduction (KA: 12.6°) and segment rekyphosis (Cobb: 10.7°) were observed for final follow-up. Pain improved from 8.8 to 2.8 (visual analogue scale). All cases showed signs of bony healing. No perioperative complications and no adjacent fractures occurred.
Conclusion: 
Preliminary results in a small, selected patient collective indicate the ability of bony healing for osteoporotic VCFs. Cementless fixation using intravertebral titanium mesh cages revealed substantial pain relief, adequate reduction, and reduction maintenance without complications.

  abstract={Study design: 
A randomized, controlled clinical trial.
Objective: 
This randomized controlled clinical trial was aimed at comparing the clinical outcomes of combined posteroanterior (P-A) fusion and transforaminal thoracic interbody fusion (TTIF) in cases of thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation.
Summary of background data: 
The optimal treatment strategy for thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation remains controversial.
Methods: 
Sixty-one patients presenting with acute fracture-dislocation of the thoracolumbar joint between March 2010 and December 2011 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the P-A or TTIF group. The radiological outcome was assessed by acquiring radiographs in the standing position and computed tomographic scans. The clinical outcome was measured in terms of the American Spinal Injury Association score, visual analogue scale score, and Oswestry Disability Index. Moreover, we assessed the severity of overall morbidity and morbidity at the donor site in the 2 patient groups. The Student t and χ tests were used for the analysis of independent variables and categorical data, respectively.
Results: 
Only 57 of the enrolled patients were available for the required 24-month follow-up period, 27 underwent TTIF and 30 underwent P-A fusion. Both treatments were similar with respect to the fusion rate, extent of decompression, loss of correction, rate of instrumentation failure, American Spinal Injury Association score, visual analogue scale score, and Oswestry Disability Index (P > 0.05). However, the blood loss, operating time, and rate of perioperative complications were greater in the P-A group than in the TTIF group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The clinical and radiological outcomes were similar for both the treatment procedures. However, our findings suggest that TTIF allows for safe interbody fusion and circumferential decompression, requires only a posterior approach, and is associated with a lower incidence of surgery-related complications.

Vertebral fracture load and stiffness from a metastatic vertebral defect model were predicted using nonlinear finite element models (FEM) and validated experimentally.
Objective: 
The study objective was to develop and validate an FEM-based tool for predicting polymer-augmented lytic vertebral fracture load and stiffness and the influence of metastatic filling materials.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty has the potential to reduce vertebral fracture risk affected with lytic metastases by providing mechanical stabilization. However, it has been shown that the mismatch in mechanical properties between poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and bone induces secondary fractures and intervertebral disc degeneration. A biodegradable copolymer, poly(propylene fumarate-co-caprolactone) (P(PF-co-CL)), has been shown to possess the appropriate mechanical properties for bone defect repair.
Methods: 
Simulated metastatic lytic defects were created in 40 cadaveric vertebral bodies, which were randomized into 4 groups: intact vertebral body (intact), simulated defect without treatment (negative), defect treated with P(PF-co-CL) (copolymer), and defect treated with PMMA (PMMA). Spines were imaged with quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and QCT/FEM-subject-specific, nonlinear models were created. Predicted fracture loads and stiffness were identified and compared with experimentally measured values using Pearson correlation analysis and paired t test.
Results: 
There was no significant difference between the measured and predicted fracture loads and stiffness for each group. Predicted fracture loads were larger for PMMA augmentation (3960 N [1371 N]) than that for the copolymer, negative and intact groups (3484 N [1497 N], 3237 N [1744 N], and 1747 N [702 N]). A similar trend was observed in the predicted stiffness. Moreover, predicted and experimental fracture loads were strongly correlated (R=0.78), whereas stiffness showed moderate correlation (R=0.39).
Conclusion: 
QCT/FEM was successful for predicting fracture loads of metastatic, polymer-augmented vertebral bodies. Overall, we have demonstrated that QCT/FEM may be a useful tool for predicting in situ vertebral fracture load resulting from vertebroplasty.

  abstract={Introduction: 
Randomized clinical trials have generated doubts regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of spinal kyphoplasty to reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with vertebral fractures. There is a paucity of data on the influence of kyphoplasty on spinal range of motion. To quantify early postoperative changes following kyphoplasty in spinal motion, a noninvasive, radiation-free measurement method was used and results related to clinical and radiological parameters.
Methods: 
The study group included 30 patients with an overall number of 54 symptomatic pathological vertebral compression fractures. All patients were treated with balloon kyphoplasty. Clinical results were recorded using the visual analog scale, SF 36, Roland Morris Score and the Oswestry Disability Index, at three time points; preoperative, 2 days postoperative, and at 12 weeks postoperative. The kyphosis angle/sagittal index were determined with biplanar X-rays. Amplitude/velocity of motion in extension/flexion was measured at each time point by use of the EpionicsSPINE(©) system (Epionics Medical GmbH; Potsdam, Germany) using two external sensor strips.
Results: 
Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans showed bone marrow edema in all vertebral bodies indicative of a recent, non-consolidated fracture. Pain and quality of life was significantly improved by kyphoplasty, both for the immediate postoperative period, as well as at 12 weeks postoperative. Radiological parameters also showed significant improvement following surgery. Total ROM did not significantly change 2 days after kyphoplasty, but amplitude and velocity were found to be increased 12 weeks postoperatively. Significant positive correlations were observed between increased range of motion and improved clinical/radiological scores.
Conclusion: 
Significant clinical and radiological improvement following kyphoplasty supports the rational for cement augmentation in patients with pathological vertebral body fractures. To the knowledge of the authors, no prior study has assessed the influence of preservation and improvement of spinal range of motion on clinical outcome following kyphoplasty.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The optimal treatment of intervertebral disk lesions accompanying thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. To evaluate short- and medium-term progression of intervertebral disk lesions accompanying vertebral fractures, MRI scans obtained after trauma were compared with scans obtained at an average follow-up of 1 year, by means of our clinically useful classification of traumatic intervertebral disk lesions.
Materials and methods: 
MRI scans of 54 disks in patients with trauma-induced single-level thoracolumbar fractures were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent posterior stabilization using a titanium internal fixator. Exclusion criteria were malignant vertebral collapse, spondylodiskitis, osteoporotic fractures, and degenerative disk disease in the uninjured disks. Morphologic changes and signal alterations of the adjacent disks were compared using routine MRI scans obtained after trauma and at an average follow-up of 1 year. Disks were divided according to their signals into four categories, from grade 0 to grade 3.
Results: 
Of the disks studied after trauma (n = 54), 27.8% were determined to be grade 0, 31.5% were grade 2, and 40.7% were grade 3. In the follow-up examination, MRI detected grade 0 in 13% of disks. Hence, more than 50% of the disks with grade 0 after trauma changed into grade 2 lesions, resulting in 46.3% grade 2 lesions. Grade 3 disk lesions (40.7%) remained the same without any sign of recovery.
Conclusion: 
In the current study, we found progressive disk degradation and creeping in instrumented and nonfused segments in thoracolumbar fractures. For further validation, randomized controlled long-term outcome investigations seem mandatory as the next step in future clinical research.},

  abstract={Background: 
While interspinous motion analysis is commonly used to determine the status of an anterior cervical fusion, the accuracy of this technique is unclear. We believed that three questions needed to be answered. What degree of image magnification is ideal? How much motion should be considered "adequate" for making dynamic radiographs? What is the optimal amount of interspinous motion for detecting pseudarthrosis?
Methods: 
We performed a retrospective study of 125 patients (109 fused segments and 153 pseudarthrotic segments) who had undergone reexploration with confirmation of fusion status. Interspinous motion at each operatively treated level and one superjacent level was measured by two independent investigators twice. Reliabilities of interspinous motion analysis at different magnification rates (25%, 100%, 150%, and 200%) were evaluated for fifty randomly selected segments to determine the optimal magnification, which we used for the remainder of the measurements. Fusion status was also determined on computed tomography (CT) by two other raters. We compared the intraoperative findings with those based on dynamic radiographs (with use of cutoff values of 1 and 2 mm of interspinous motion as the indication of pseudarthrosis) and CT.
Results: 
On radiographs, both 150% and 200% magnification yielded higher interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities compared with 25% and 100% magnification, and the reliabilities at 150% and 200% were similar to each other, so subsequent measurements were made at 150%. The cutoff value of interspinous motion for detecting pseudarthrosis was 0.9 mm as determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Compared with CT, interspinous motion of ≥ 1 mm showed relatively low sensitivity (79.5%) and negative predictive value (77.1%) and similar specificity (97.0%) and positive predictive value (97.4%). Using interspinous motion of ≥ 2 mm as the cutoff decreased the sensitivity and negative predictive value to 46.6% and 56.8%, respectively. Our evaluation of what constituted adequate dynamic motion for making the radiographs showed that, with use of interspinous motion of ≥ 1 mm as the cutoff for detecting pseudarthrosis, superjacent interspinous motion of ≥ 4 mm increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value (86.3% and 83.4%) compared with those associated with alternative cutoffs of superjacent interspinous motion (≥ 3.5, ≥ 5, and ≥ 6 mm), and the specificity (96.1%) and positive predictive value (96.9%) were reasonable.
Conclusions: 
Use of interspinous motion of ≥ 1 mm as the cutoff for detection of anterior cervical pseudarthrosis on radiographs magnified 150% and made with superjacent interspinous motion of ≥ 4 mm yielded accuracies comparable with those of CT.},

To evaluate the accuracy of computer-assisted sacral screw fixation compared with conventional techniques in the dysmorphic versus normal sacrum.
Design: 
Review of a previous study database.
Setting: 
Database of a multinational study with 9 participating trauma centers.
Patients: 
The reviewed group included 130 patients, 72 from the navigated group and 58 from the conventional group. Of these, 109 were in the nondysmorphic group and 21 in the dysmorphic group.
Intervention: 
Placement of sacroiliac (SI) screws was performed using standard fluoroscopy for the conventional group and BrainLAB navigation software with either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional (3D) navigation for the navigated group.
Main outcome measurements: 
Accuracy of SI screw placement by 2-dimensional and 3D navigation versus conventional fluoroscopy in dysmorphic and nondysmorphic patients, as evaluated by 6 observers using postoperative computerized tomography imaging at least 1 year after initial surgery. Intraobserver agreement was also evaluated.
Results: 
There were 11.9% (13/109) of patients with misplaced screws in the nondysmorphic group and 28.6% (6/21) of patients with misplaced screws in the dysmorphic group, none of which were in the 3D navigation group. Raw agreement between the 6 observers regarding misplaced screws was 32%. However, the percent overall agreement was 69.0% (kappa = 0.38, P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
The use of 3D navigation to improve intraoperative imaging for accurate insertion of SI screws is magnified in the dysmorphic proximal sacral segment. We recommend the use of 3D navigation, where available, for insertion of SI screws in patients with normal and dysmorphic proximal sacral segments.

  abstract={Study design: 
Biomechanical cadaver study.
Objective: 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate 2 different methods with respect to height restoration and preservation in a cadaver model under cyclic loading.
Summary of background data: 
Standard balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) represents a well-established treatment opportunity for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. BKP was developed to restore vertebral height and improve sagittal alignment. Its use has grown significantly over the last 2 decades. In contrast, distinct biomechanical data are missing. Within the last few years, several alternative techniques with regard to height restoration have emerged, such as radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK).
Methods: 
Twenty-five vertebral bodies of 2 female cadavers with secured osteoporosis were examined. Standardized vertebral wedge compression fractures were created. Afterward, 2 groups were randomly assigned: 12 vertebral bodies were treated with BKP and 13 vertebral bodies by RFK under a preload of 100 N. Then the vertebral bodies underwent cyclic loading (100,000 cycles, 100 to 600 N, 5 Hz). Anterior, central, and posterior vertebral body heights were evaluated by CT scans.
Results: 
Anterior height was reduced after fracture 6.3 mm (SD 3) for the BKP group and 7.2 mm (SD 3) in the RFK group (P>0.1). After treatment, the difference in the initial anterior height was 4.5 mm (SD 2) for the BKP group and 4.7 mm (SD 3) for the RFK group (P>0.1). After cyclic loading, the difference was 5.3 mm (SD 3) for the BKP group and 5.2 mm (SD 3) for the RFK group (P>0.1). The average cement volume used was 8.7 mL (SD 1) for the BKP group and 4.8 mL (SD 2) for the RFK group (P<0.0001).
Conclusions: 
On the basis of our results, the unipedicular RFK in osteoporotic compression fractures might represent a promising alternative for the clinical setting.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The impact of percutaneous internal fixation as a supplement to percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures in elderly patients is unclear. We conducted a clinical controlled trial to investigate the effect and outcomes of this technique in such patients.
Methods: 
Forty-three patients over 65 years old with thoracolumbar burst fractures without nerve injuries were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with simple PKP (control group, n = 22) or percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw internal fixation with PKP (treatment group, n = 21). The patients were followed for at least 2 years postoperatively and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.
Results: 
There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The treatment group had better VAS scores and greater postoperative improvement on the ODI compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Postoperative kyphosis angle correction in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group, and loss of correction postoperatively was significantly less (P < 0.05). In the control group, two patients suffered refractures of the injured vertebra postoperatively and one had a fracture in the adjacent vertebra. No postoperative complications needing management were noted in either group.
Conclusions: 
Compared with simple PKP, percutaneous internal fixation with PKP is a valuable surgical option for the treatment of selected elderly patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A novel randomized, controlled, unblinded clinical trial comparing 2 procedural interventions for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Objective: 
The primary study objective was to evaluate cement leakage for a cement directed kyphoplasty system (CDKS) with anteriorly biased cement flow and vertebroplasty. The secondary study objective was to compare adjacent level fracture rates and vertebral body height for these 2 intervention methods.
Summary of background data: 
Cement leakage remains a significant clinical problem associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Uncontrolled cement flow in the posterior direction can result in leakage into the vertebral veins or spinal canal, leading to potentially serious clinical complications.
Methods: 
Seventy-seven patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were enrolled. Patients were randomized 2:1 for treatment with CDKS (49 patients, 65 levels) or vertebroplasty (28 patients, 39 levels). Cement leakage was evaluated from radiographs and computed tomographic scans. Three- and 12-month follow-ups included additional radiographs and computed tomographic scans to assess changes in vertebral body height and the incidence of new fractures.
Results: 
Treatment with CDKS significantly reduced the number of levels with leaks and the total number of leaks per level, as compared with vertebroplasty (P = 0.0132 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Significantly, fewer lateral cortical and spinal canal leaks (posterior leaks) occurred in the CDKS group (P = 0.0050, P = 0.02260, respectively). Three adjacent level fractures occurred in the vertebroplasty group, as compared with 2 in the CDKS group. Vertebral body height maintenance was equivalent.
Conclusion: 
Cement directed kyphoplasty effectively reduces posterior cement leakage, reducing the risk of leakage related complications.
Level of evidence: 
2.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with and without interventional tumor removal (ITR) on malignant vertebral compression fractures and symptoms of neurological compression.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 52 patients with malignant vertebral compression fractures and symptoms of neurological compression were selected for PVP and ITR (n = 24, group A) or PVP alone (n = 28, group B). A 14-G needle and a guidewire were inserted into the vertebral body, followed by sequential dilatation of the tract with the working cannula until the last working cannula reached the distal pedicle of the vertebral arch. ITR was performed with marrow nucleus rongeurs. Then, 5-10 mL cement was injected into the extirpated vertebral body.
Results: 
PVP procedures with and without ITR were successful in all patients, except for one patient in group A. The clinical assessment obtained at the initial and final follow-up indicated that the rates of full recovery and improved neurological compression symptoms were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Treatment of malignant vertebral compression fractures with symptoms of neurological compression with PVP and ITR resulted in better intermediate-term clinical results in terms of improved neurological compression symptoms than the currently recommended approach of PVP.
Key points: 
• Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is now widely used for vertebral collapse due to malignancy • PVP can be coupled with interventional tumour removal (ITR) • PVP coupled with ITR provided better clinical results for neurological compression • PVP coupled with ITR provided better pain relief • PVP and ITR can remove tumour and helps prevent polymethyl methacrylate leakage.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To report our experience in percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) for tumours and insufficiency fractures of the sacrum.
Methods: 
Single-centre retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who underwent 67 PSPs for intractable pain from sacral tumours (84.5 %) or from osteoporotic fractures (15.5 %). The following data were assessed: visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after the procedure for global pain; short-term (1-month) clinical follow-up using a four-grade patient satisfaction scale (worse, unchanged, mild improvement and significant improvement); modification in analgesics consumption; referred short-term walking mobility. Minor and major complications were systematically assessed.
Results: 
The mean VAS score was 5.3 ± 2.0 in pre-procedure and 1.7 ± 1.8 in post-procedure. At 1-month follow-up, 34/58 (58.5 %) patients experienced a mild improvement; 15/58 (26 %) presented a significant improvement while 4/58 (7 %) and 5/58 (8.5 %) patients had unchanged or worse pain, respectively. Decreased analgesic consumption was observed in 34 % (20/58) of the patients. Eighty percent of patients with walking limitation experienced improvement, 16 % remained unchanged and 4 % were worse. We noted minor complications in 2/58 patients (3.4 %) and major complications in 2/58 patients (3.4 %).
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous sacroplasty for metastatic and osteoporotic fractures is a safe and effective technique in terms of pain relief and functional outcome.
Key points: 
• Percutaneous sacroplasty provides pain relief and functional improvement for insufficiency sacral fractures. • Percutaneous sacroplasty provides pain relief and function improvement for sacral tumours. • The major complication rate is acceptable (3.4 %), and is higher in sacral tumours. • Posterior wall/cortical sacral bone disruption is not statistically associated with more complications. • However, osteolytic tumours seem to be associated with higher risk of complications.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The method of free-hand pedicle screw placement is generally safe although it carries potential risks. For this reason, several highly accurate computer-assisted systems were developed and are currently on the market. However, these devices have certain disadvantages. We have developed a method of pedicle screw placement in the lumbar and sacral region using a multi-level drill guide template, created with the rapid prototyping technology and have validated it in a clinical study. The aim of the study was to manufacture and evaluate the accuracy of a multi-level drill guide template for lumbar and first sacral pedicle screw placement and to compare it with the free-hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision.
Materials and methods: 
In 2011 and 2012, a randomized clinical trial was performed on 20 patients. 54 screws were implanted in the trial group using templates and 54 in the control group using the fluoroscopy-supervised free-hand technique. Furthermore, applicability for the first sacral level was tested. Preoperative CT-scans were taken and templates were designed using the selective laser sintering method. Postoperative evaluation and statistical analysis of pedicle violation, displacement, screw length and deviation were performed for both groups.
Results: 
The incidence of cortex perforation was significantly reduced in the template group; likewise, the deviation and displacement level of screws in the sagittal plane. In both groups there was no significantly important difference in deviation and displacement level in the transversal plane as not in pedicle screw length. The results for the first sacral level resembled the main investigated group.
Conclusions: 
The method significantly lowers the incidence of cortex perforation and is therefore potentially applicable in clinical practice, especially in some selected cases. The applied method, however, carries a potential for errors during manufacturing and practical usage and therefore still requires further improvements.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Thoracoscopic surgery or video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) of the thoracic and lumbar spine has greatly evolved since it appeared less than 20 years ago. Nowadays, it is indicated in a large number of processes and injuries. The aim of this article, in its 2 parts, is to review the current status of VATS in treatment of the thoracic and lumbar spine in its entire spectrum.
Development: 
After reviewing the current literature, we develop each of the large groups of indications where VATS is used, one by one. This first part contains a description of general thoracoscopic surgical technique including the necessary prerequisites, transdiaphragmatic approach, techniques and instrumentation used in spine reconstruction, as well as a review of treatment and specific techniques in the management of spinal fractures.
Conclusions: 
Thoracoscopic surgery is in many cases an alternative to conventional open surgery. The transdiaphragmatic approach has made endoscopic treatment of many thoracolumbar junction processes possible, thus widening the spectrum of therapeutic indications. These include the treatment of fractures and deformities, as well as the reconstruction of injured spinal segments and decompression of the spinal canal in any etiological processes if the lesion placement is favourable to antero-lateral approach. Good clinical results of thoracoscopic surgery are supported by the growing experience reflected in a large number of articles. The degree of complications in thoracoscopic surgery is comparable to open surgery, with benefits in morbidity of the approach and subsequent patient recovery.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective, parallel-group, controlled comparative randomized study.
Objective: 
This study compares the efficacy in sagittal vertebral height and wedge deformity restoration, polymethylmethacrylate cement leakage safety, and functional outcome of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) versus KIVA (a novel vertebral augmentation technique) implant for the augmentation of fresh osteoporotic vertebral body fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures have been widely used to treat vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. The results of these trials are encouraging in augmenting the vertebra and reducing the wedge deformity. However, after BK, polymethylmethacrylate leakage remains common after A3.1 AO type fractures, with a frequency per vertebra into the epidural space up to 9.8% but less common (0.03%-5.6%) in A1.1 AO type fracture. KIVA is a novel percutaneous uniportal vertebral augmentation device that is designed to restore the vertebral body and reduce polymethylmethacrylate leakage.
Methods: 
From a total 190 patients with osteoporotic fractures who were initially enrolled in this prospective randomized study, 10 patients were excluded (5 met exclusion criteria, 5 with evidence of metastasis). This study examined 82 patients (69 ± 11 yr) with 133 fractures who received KIVA and 86 patients (72 ± 9 yr) with 122 fractures that were reinforced with BK. Anterior (anterior vertebral body height ratio [AVBHr]), midline (midline vertebral body height ratio [MVBHr]), and posterior (posterior vertebral body height ratio [PVBHr]) vertebral body height ratio and Gardner segmental vertebral wedge deformity were measured preoperatively to postoperatively. New fractures were recorded at the final observation. The baseline anthropometric and roentgenographic parameters did not differ between the 2 groups. Any cement leakage was examined on plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scan. All patients were followed for an average of 14 months (range, 13-15 mo) postoperatively. RESULTS.: At the final observation, both KIVA and BK restored significantly AVBHr, PVBHr, and MVBHr. However, only KIVA device reduced significantly the Gardner angle (P = 0.002). Residual kyphosis of more than 5° was measured significantly more (P < 0.001) in the BK than in KIVA spines. KIVA showed significantly lower (3%, χ2, P ≤ 0.05) leakage) [corrected] (paravertebral, intradiscal) rate per vertebra than BK (0.098%) in which because of intracanal leakage 2 patients developed acute paraplegia and were reoperated in emergency. New fracture rate was similar in both groups. Back pain scores (visual analogue scale), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (Physical Function and Mental Health domains), and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved significantly in the patients of both groups.
Conclusion: 
Both KIVA and BK restored in short-term similarly vertebral body height, but only KIVA restored vertebral body wedge deformity. KIVA was followed by significantly lower and harmless always extracanal leakage rate than BK. Longer observation is needed to show whether these radiological changes have any functional impact.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) requires relatively lengthy fluoroscopic guidance, which might lead to substantial radiation exposure to patients or operators. The two-fluoroscopic technique (two-plane radiographs obtained using two fluoroscopes) during PV can provide simultaneous two-planar projections with reducing operative time. However, the two-fluoroscopic technique may expose the operator or patient to increased radiation dose. The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of radiation exposure to the patient or operator that occurs during PV using one- vs. two-fluoroscopic technique.
Methods: 
Two radiation dosimeters were placed on the right flank of each patient and on the upper sternum of each operator during 26 single-level PV procedures by one senior surgeon. The use of two-fluoroscopic technique (13 patients) and one-fluoroscopic technique (13 patients) were allocated in a consecutive and alternative manner. The operative time and mean radiation dose to each patient and operator were monitored and compared between groups.
Results: 
Mean radiation dose to the patient was 1.97±1.20 mSv (95% CI, 0.71 to 3.23) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 0.95±0.34 mSv (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.23) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.031). Mean radiation dose to the operator was 0.27±0.12 mSv (95% CI, 0.17-0.56) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 0.25±0.14 mSv (95% CI, 0.06-0.44) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.653). The operative time was significantly different between groups: 47.15±13.48 min (range, 20-75) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 36.62±8.42 min (range, 21-50) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.019).
Conclusion: 
Compared to the one-fluoroscopic technique, the two-fluoroscopic technique used during PV provides not only shorter operative times but also reduces the radiation exposure to the patient. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regards to radiation exposure to the operator.},

  abstract={The study aim was to develop and apply an experimental technique to determine the biomechanical effect of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate (CaP) cement on the stiffness and strength of augmented vertebrae following traumatic fracture. Twelve burst type fractures were generated in porcine three-vertebra segments. The specimens were randomly split into two groups (n=6), imaged using microCT and tested under axial loading. The two groups of fractured specimens underwent a vertebroplasty procedure, one group was augmented with CaP cement designed and developed at Queen's University Belfast. The other group was augmented with PMMA cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK). The specimens were imaged and re-tested . An intact single vertebra specimen group (n=12) was also imaged and tested under axial loading. A significant decrease (p<0.01) was found between the stiffness of the fractured and intact groups, demonstrating that the fractures generated were sufficiently severe, to adversely affect mechanical behaviour. Significant increase (p<0.01) in failure load was found for the specimen group augmented with the PMMA cement compared to the pre-augmentation group, conversely, no significant increase (p<0.01) was found in the failure load of the specimens augmented with CaP cement, this is attributed to the significantly (p<0.05) lower volume of CaP cement that was successfully injected into the fracture, compared to the PMMA cement. The effect of the percentage of cement fracture fill, cement modulus on the specimen stiffness and ultimate failure load could be investigated further by using the methods developed within this study to test a more injectable CaP cement.},

  abstract={Background: 
The purpose of this paper is to determine the early incidence of disc de- generation adjacent to the vertebral body of osteoporotic fracture treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty and whether adjacent disc degeneration is accelerated by this two procedures.
Methods: 
182 patients with painful vertebral compression fractures were treated. A total of 97 patients were enrolled in this prospective study. 97 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years were classified into control group and surgical treatment group of non-random. 35 patients were in control group and 62 patients who were performed percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty in treatment group. X-ray and Magnetic resonance imaging were done at the first and final visit. The grade of disc degeneration above the fractured vertebral was confirmed by evaluation of bony oedema in the fat suppressed sequences and T2-weighted image of magnetic resonance imaging. The height of degenerative disc was measured on X-ray film.
Results: 
All patients were followed up two years after the first visit and the follow-up rate was 90.7% (88/97). The incidence of degeneration of adjacent disc above the fractured vertebral was 29.0% (9/31) in control group and 52.6% (30/57) in treatment group. It presented a statistically significant difference between two groups about the incidence of adjacent disc degeneration (P=0.033). The percentage of adjacent disc height reduction in control group was 13.5% and 17.6% in treatment group. Statistically significant difference of VAS score and ODI was not found between the first evaluation postoperatively and the final follow-up in treatment group (P>0.05).
Conclusions: 
Disc degeneration adjacent to the fractured vertebral is accelerated by VP and BK procedures in the early stage, but clinical outcomes has not been weakened even in the presence of accelerated disc degeneration.},

  abstract={Objective: 
This prospective randomized controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of two paraspinal muscle-sparing surgical approaches for the management of neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and posterior ligamentous complex injuries.
Methods: 
Patients were randomized to undergo either percutaneous (n=31) or paraspinal (n=30) fluoroscopically-guided pedicle screw-rod fixation, and were followed for ≥3 years. Preoperative postural reduction was attempted in all patients.
Results: 
The percutaneous approach was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss and shorter duration of surgery and hospitalization, as well as less pain and better functional recovery at 3 months after surgery compared with the paraspinal approach. Paraspinal surgery resulted in significantly better correction of kyphosis and restoration of vertebral height compared with percutaneous surgery. There were no differences in long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
The minimally invasive percutaneous approach appears to be better in cases of successful postural reduction. The paraspinal approach results in better surgical correction and is, therefore, recommended for patients without successful postural reduction.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective, 2-center, observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
Objective: 
Investigate clinical and radiologic outcomes of bracing versus no-bracing in the treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Management of thoracolumbar burst fractures depends upon clinical presentation of neurological deficit and radiographic features of fracture severity. Neurologically intact patients with mild deformity and biomechanical stability may be treated with conservative therapy.
Methods: 
Patients with stable (AO type A3), single level, thoracolumbar burst fractures between T12 and L2 with no neurological deficit were randomized to nonoperative treatment with a customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) or no-brace. Self-reported clinical outcomes of pain, disability, and health-related quality of life, and radiographic outcomes of kyphotic progression and loss of vertebral height, assessed by 2 independent reviewers blinded to treatment group, were measured at 6 months follow-up.
Results: 
Twenty-three consecutive eligible patients were included (TLSO: n=12; no-brace: n=11). There were no between-group differences regarding level of injury (P=0.75) and baseline spine geometry including fractional canal compromise (P=0.49), anterior loss of vertebral body height (P=0.28), and sagittal Cobb angle (P=0.13). In-hospital stay was significantly shorter in the no-brace group (mean: 2.8±3.0 d) compared with the TLSO group (mean: 6.3±2.1 d; P=0.004). At follow-up there were no differences in anterior loss of vertebral body height (TLSO: 12.5%±10.2% vs. no-brace: 11.9%±8.1%; P=0.88), kyphotic progression (TLSO: 5.3±4.4 degrees vs. no-brace 5.2±3.6 degrees; P=0.93), adverse events, or self-reported clinical outcomes.
Conclusions: 
Neurologically intact patients with stable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with or without bracing had similar radiographic and clinical outcomes at 6 months follow-up. The no-brace group had shorter in-hospital lengths of stay. Conservative therapy involving early mobilization without brace immobilization may be warranted. Further studies with a larger series of patients and longer follow-up are required for conclusive findings.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The percutaneous insertion technique requires surgical skill and experience. However, there have been few clinical reports evaluating the accuracy of minimally invasive pedicle screw placement using the conventional fluoroscopy method. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of percutaneous pedicle screw placement in the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures using two-plane conventional fluoroscopy.
Methods: 
A prospective clinical trial was performed. A total of 502 percutaneous pedicle screws in 111 patients, all inserted with the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy, were evaluated. The safety and accuracy of pedicle screw placement were based on the evaluation of postoperative axial 3-mm slice computed tomography scans using the scoring system described by Zdichavsky et al. [Eur J Trauma 30:234-240, 2004; Eur J Trauma 30:241-247, 2004].
Results: 
427/502 pedicle screws (85 %) were classified as good and excellent concerning the best possible screw length and 494/502 (98 %) were found to have good or excellent position. One screw had to be revised due to medial position with a neurological deficit.
Conclusions: 
This study demonstrates the feasibility of placing percutaneous posterior thoracolumbar pedicle screws with the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy. Minimally invasive transpedicular instrumentation is an accurate, reliable and safe method to treat a variety of spinal disorders, including thoracic and lumbar spine fractures.},

Functional outcome was evaluated using the Greenough Low Back Outcome Score. Neurological function was graded using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale. Radiological outcome was assessed on the basis of the angle of kyphosis. Peri-operative blood transfusion requirements and duration of surgery were significantly higher in the fusion group (p = 0.029 and p < 0.001, respectively). There were no clinical or radiological differences in outcome between the groups (all outcomes p > 0.05).

  abstract={Objective: 
Currently, there are no clinical studies comparing different cement augmentation methods, and no clinical observational studies of a unipedicular approach. DESIGN, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The present study compared three commercially available vertebral augmentation systems: balloon kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty and shield kyphoplasty. The primary objective was to assess change in subjective severity of backache on a visual analog scale (VAS) and subjective improvement in quality of life on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), at a mean 6 months post-surgery. The secondary objective was to analyze current radiological imaging (X-ray, and in some cases CT) with regard to height restoration, cement distribution and leakage and recurrent fracture.
Results: 
Mean follow-up was 5.8 months. Mean preoperative Beck vertebral height index did not significantly differ between the three augmentation system groups (P>0.05). Comparing surgery time, fluoroscopy time and dose-area-product (cGy × cm(2)) showed a statistically significant difference (P<0.01) in favor of the vertebroplasty technique. Augmentation provided significant improvement in VAS pain assessment, but with no significant difference between augmentation systems. Results on the ODI were less pronounced, with significant improvement of 22% to 45%, but again without significant difference between augmentation systems.
Conclusions: 
Overall, apart from mostly asymptomatic cement leakage, vertebroplasty could be considered as the surgical procedure of choice.},

  abstract={Object: 
The aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for and determine the rate of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after intensity-modulated, near-simultaneous, CT image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases.
Methods: 
The study group consisted of 123 vertebral bodies (VBs) in 93 patients enrolled in prospective protocols for metastatic disease. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Stereotactic body radiotherapy consisted of 1, 3, or 5 fractions for overall median doses of 18, 27, and 30 Gy, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging studies, obtained at baseline and at each follow-up, were evaluated for VCFs, tumor involvement, and radiographic progression. Self-reported average pain levels were scored based on the 11-point (0-10) Brief Pain Inventory both at baseline and at follow-up. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥ 30.
Results: 
The median imaging follow-up was 14.9 months (range 1-71 months). Twenty-five new or progressing fractures (20%) were identified, and the median time to progression was 3 months after SBRT. The most common histologies included renal cancer (36 VBs, 10 fractures, 10 tumor progressions), breast cancer (20 VBs, 0 fractures, 5 tumor progressions), thyroid cancer (14 VBs, 1 fracture, 2 tumor progressions), non-small cell lung cancer (13 VBs, 3 fractures, 3 tumor progressions), and sarcoma (9 VBs, 2 fractures, 2 tumor progressions). Fifteen VBs were treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty after SBRT, with 5 procedures done for preexisting VCFs. Tumor progression was noted in 32 locations (26%) with 5 months' median time to progression. At the time of noted fracture progression there was a trend toward higher average pain scores but no significant change in the median value. Univariate logistic regression showed that an age > 55 years (HR 6.05, 95% CI 2.1-17.47), a preexisting fracture (HR 5.05, 95% CI 1.94-13.16), baseline pain and narcotic use before SBRT (pain: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.62; narcotic: HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.17-7.56) and after SBRT (pain: HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70; narcotic: HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.41-9.29) were statistically significant predictors of fracture progression. On multivariate analysis an age > 55 years (HR 10.66, 95% CI 2.81-40.36), a preexisting fracture (HR 9.17, 95% CI 2.31-36.43), and baseline pain (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.9) were found to be significant risks, whereas obesity (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0-0.2) was protective.
Conclusions: 
Stereotactic body radiotherapy is associated with a significant risk (20%) of VCF. Risk factors for VCF include an age > 55 years, a preexisting fracture, and baseline pain. These risk factors may aid in the selection of which spinal SBRT patients should be considered for prophylactic vertebral stabilization or augmentation procedures.

  abstract={Study design: 
This study was designed as a cohort study comparing a prospective sample to a historic control group.
Objective: 
The aim of the actual trial was to compare the rate of cement leakage by quantitative volumetry comparing viscosity-controlled and non-viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a widespread safe and effective technique in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures and vertebral metastatic lesions. However, cement leakage has been identified as a problem of this technique. The leakage rates are reported to range from 7% to 90%. The main influence factor for leakage has been demonstrated to be cement viscosity. Assessment of appropriate injection viscosity is highly subjective and observer dependent. Viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty (Vertecem system) has been developed to objectively measure cement viscosity before injection. It introduces a viscosimeter to measure the actual cement viscosity before injection into the vertebra, and therefore may prevent leakages resulting from low-viscosity cement injections. Despite more than 800 Pubmed citations on PVP, there is only 1 report on distinct measurement of cement leakage by semiquantitative volumetry.
Methods: 
A total of 111 vertebrae in 68 patients, in which PVP was performed for osteoporotic fractures, were included. Thirty-seven patients (76 operated vertebrae) were assessed prospectively using the viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty. The results were compared with a retrospective group of 31 patients (35 operated vertebrae) undergoing PVP without using a viscosimeter.
Results: 
: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the applied volume of cement per fractured vertebra (P=0.73). The frequency of cement leakage in viscosimete-assisted vertebroplasty was 42.1% and 58.3% in the historic group. Cement leakage into the basivertebral vein (type B), was detected in 6.6% with and in 11.1% without viscosimetry.
Conclusions: 
The use of viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty led to a decrease in the leakage rate from 58.3% to 42.1%. Leakage into the basivertebral vein with the risk of compression of nerval structures was reduced to almost 50% when viscosimetry was performed. It revealed to be a helpful tool for more unexperienced surgeons to assess the appropriate viscosity for vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Background: 
Decision-making regarding nonoperative versus operative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in the absence of neurologic deficits is controversial. Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately and being exposed to unnecessary adverse consequences.
Purpose: 
Using meta-analysis, we therefore compared pain (VAS) and function (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit treated nonoperatively and operatively. Secondary outcomes included return to work, radiographic progression of kyphosis, radiographic progression of spinal canal stenosis, complications, cost, and length of hospitalization.
Methods: 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE(®), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for 'thoracic fractures', 'lumbar fractures', 'non-operative', 'operative' and 'controlled clinical trials'. We established five criteria for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The main analyses were performed on individual patient data from randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed on VAS pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score, kyphosis, and return to work, including data from nonrandomized controlled trials and using fixed effects meta-analysis. We identified four trials, including two randomized controlled trials consisting of 79 patients (41 with operative treatment and 38 with nonoperative treatment). The mean followups ranged from 24 to 118 months.
Results: 
We found no between-group differences in baseline pain, kyphosis, and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. At last followup, there were no between-group differences in pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores, and return to work rates. We found an improvement in kyphosis ranging from means of 12.8º to 11º in the operative group, but surgery was associated with higher complication rates and costs.
Conclusions: 
Operative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit may improve residual kyphosis, but does not appear to improve pain or function at an average of 4 years after injury and is associated with higher complication rates and costs.
Level of evidence: 
Level II, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of level of evidence.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To comparatively assess the clinical outcome of modified unilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
The clinical outcome and incidence of cement extrusion in a consecutive group of 70 patients at our institution between December 2005 and December 2008 was retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-five patients were randomly distributed to modified percutaneous vertebroplasty (Group A) and 35 to traditional percutaneous vertebroplasty (Group B). A visual analog scale (VAS) was used on the first post-operative day and 1 year later to assess the severity of pain before and after vertebroplasty. The incidence of cement extrusion on CT scan was also compared between the two groups.
Results: 
The treatment was successful in all seventy patients. The incidence of cement extrusion was 14.29% (5/35 patients) in group A, and 37.12% (13/35 patients) in group B, this difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). No patients had serious complications. Complete pain relief was achieved in 50 patients, and significant relief in the other 20 (20/70 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between Groups A and B.
Conclusion: 
Modified percutaneous vertebroplasty enhances the accuracy of cement injection into the center of the vertebral body, increasing the safety of the procedure with no increase in cost. It is a safer and more easily performed technique for treating patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures than traditional percutaneous vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A comparative study of chronic painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs), which underwent kyphoplasty via unipedicular versus bipedicular approach.
Objective: 
To assess the clinical and radiographical outcomes in treating chronic painful OVCFs compared by unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty (KP).
Summary of background data: 
OVCFs commonly occur in aged people and as many as one-third of them progress to chronic pain. Our previous research has proved that unipedicular and bipedicular KP can achieve comparable radiographical and clinical results in early stage. To give a medium-term and long-term assessment, we completed the comparison of outcomes 6 months and 2 years after surgery.
Methods: 
Fifty patients with a total of 56 chronic painful OVCFs completed the follow-ups of 2 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after surgery. Group I (n=27) were treated with unipedicular KP and group II (n=23) with bipedicular KP. Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores were compared within each group and between groups. The radiographic outcomes were evaluated by the restoration rate and vertebral height lost rate in the most compressed point of the vertebral bodies.
Results: 
Significant improvement on the visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores were noted in each group (P<0.001), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. Although the restoration rate in group II was higher than in group I (P=0.005) in early stage, the height lost ratio showed no significant differences 6 months or 2 years later (P=0.746, 0.627).
Conclusions: 
Chronic painful OVCFs should be candidates for KP, and there was no difference in pain relief when treated with either unipedicular or bipedicular KP.Although the bipedicular KP is more efficacious in vertebral height restoration in early stage, the unipedicular KP can maintain the same degree of the restored vertebral height in the long run.},

  abstract={Background: 
The standard care in patients with a painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is conservative therapy. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV), a minimally invasive technique, is a new treatment option. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCT) provide conflicting results: two sham-controlled studies showed no benefit of PV while an unmasked but controlled RCT (VERTOS II) found effective pain relief at acceptable costs. The objective of this study is to compare pain relief after PV with a sham intervention in selected patients with an acute osteoporotic VCF using the same strict inclusion criteria as in VERTOS II. Secondary outcome measures are back pain related disability and quality of life.
Methods: 
The VERTOS IV study is a prospective, multicenter RCT with pain relief as primary endpoint. Patients with a painful osteoporotic VCF with bone edema on MR imaging, local back pain for 6 weeks or less, osteopenia and aged 50 years or older, after obtaining informed consent, are included and randomized for PV or a sham intervention. In total 180 patients will be enrolled. Follow-up is at regular intervals during a 1-year period with a standard Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain and pain medication. Necessary additional therapies and complications are recorded.
Discussion: 
The VERTOS IV study is a methodologically sound RCT designed to assess pain relief after PV compared to a sham intervention in patients with an acute osteoporotic VCF selected on strict inclusion criteria.

  abstract={Introduction: 
Transpedicular fixation can be challenging in the osteoporotic spine. Expansive pedicle screw (EPS) and polymethylmethacrylate-augmented pedicle screw (PMMA-PS) were both used to increase screw stability. However, there are a little or no biomechanical comparisons of EPS and PMMA-PS, especially in primary spinal surgery in osteoporotic vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to compare the stability of EPS and PMMA-PS in primary spinal surgery.
Materials and methods: 
Fifteen osteoporotic vertebrae were randomly divided into three groups. The conventional pedicle screw (CPS) was inserted in CPS group, the pilot hole was filled with PMMA followed by CPS insertion in PMMA-PS group, and EPS was inserted in EPS group. Twenty-four hours later, X-ray and CT examination and biomechanical tests were performed to all vertebrae.
Results: 
In PMMA-PS group, PMMA existed in bone tissue around the CPS in both vertebral body and pedicle of vertebral arch, and PMMA surrounding the screw formed a spindle-shaped structure in vertebral body. In EPS group, anterior part of EPS presented an obvious expansion in vertebral body and formed a clawlike structure. Screw stabilities in PMMA-PS and EPS groups were significantly enhanced compared with those in CPS group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between PMMA-PS and EPS groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Expansive pedicle screw can markedly enhance screw stability with a similar effect to the traditional method of screw augmentation with PMMA in primary surgery in osteoporotic vertebrae. In addition, EPS can overcome pedicle fracture, leakage and compression caused by lager screw and augmentation with PMMA. We propose that EPS is an effective, safe and easy method and has a great application potential in augmentation of screw stability in osteoporosis in clinic.},

  abstract={Vertebral fractures are often painful and lead to reduced quality of life and disability. We compared the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty to nonsurgical therapy over 24 months in patients with acute painful fractures. Adults with one to three vertebral fractures were randomized within 3 months from onset of pain to undergo kyphoplasty (n = 149) or nonsurgical therapy (n = 151). Quality of life, function, disability, and pain were assessed over 24 months. Kyphoplasty was associated with greater improvements in Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores when averaged across the 24-month follow-up period compared with nonsurgical therapy [overall treatment effect 3.24 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-5.01, p = .0004]; the treatment difference remained statistically significant at 6 months (3.39 points, 95% CI 1.13-5.64, p = .003) but not at 12 months (1.70 points, 95% CI -0.59 to 3.98, p = .15) or 24 months (1.68 points, 95% CI -0.63 to 3.99, p = .15). Greater improvement in back pain was observed over 24 months for kyphoplasty (overall treatment effect -1.49 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.10, p < .0001); the difference between groups remained statistically significant at 24 months (-0.80 points, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.20, p = .009). There were two device-related serious adverse events in the second year that occurred at index vertebrae (a spondylitis and an anterior cement migration). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the number of patients (47.5% for kyphoplasty, 44.1% for control) with new radiographic vertebral fractures; fewer fractures occurred (~18%) within the second year. Compared with nonsurgical management, kyphoplasty rapidly reduces pain and improves function, disability, and quality of life without increasing the risk of additional vertebral fractures. The differences from nonsurgical management are statistically significant when averaged across 24 months. Most outcomes are not statistically different at 24 months, but the reduction in back pain remains statistically significant at all time points.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective study of patients who underwent multilevel balloon kyphoplasty at a single institute.
Objective: 
To examine and compare the safety and long-term radiographic and clinical effects of unilateral or bilateral balloon kyphoplasty to treat multilevel symptomatic vertebral compression fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Typically, balloon kyphoplasty involves placement of inflatable bone tamp via a bilateral transpedicular or extrapedicular approach. Recently, several articles reported unilateral kyphoplasty with comparable outcomes. However, few prospective randomized study comparing the radiographic and clinical outcomes using unilateral and bilateral approaches was reported. METHODS.: Forty-nine patients with 114 Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unilateral or bilateral balloon kyphoplasty. Preoperative and postoperative pain scores, back disability, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores were compared with at least a 2-year follow-up. Vertebral body height and vertebral body kyphotic angle from this cohort were analyzed before surgery, after surgery, and at final follow-up.
Results: 
Both unilateral and bilateral balloon kyphoplasty resulted in significant pain reduction and back dysfunction improvement and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Quality of life assessment using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey recorded marked and significant improvements in all mean subscale scores except general health and social function. Regarding the pain reduction, back dysfunction, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores, no significant difference existed between two groups. Significant increases of anterior and middle vertebral heights were recorded for both groups after surgery and maintained for the period of follow-up. The mean correction of vertebral body kyphotic angle was about 7° in both groups. Asymptomatic cement extravasation occurred in six of 49 of patients, and three patients developed additional fractures at untreated levels during the period of follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Both unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty markedly improve symptom-related clinical effects of multilevel vertebral compression fractures and result in significant vertebral height restoration and kyphosis correction that remains stable for at least 2 years after treatment.},

  abstract={Background: 
The incidence of screw loosening increases significantly in elderly patients with severe osteoporosis. Open vertebral cement augmentation of expandable pedicle screw fixation may improve fixation strength in the osteoporotic vertebrae.
Materials and methods: 
Twenty cadaveric vertebrae (L1-L5) were harvested from six osteoporotic lumbar spines. Axial pullout tests were performed to compare the maximum pullout strength (Fmax) of four methods: 1. Conventional pedicle screws (CPS), 2. Expandable pedicle screws (EPS), 3. Cement augmentation of CPS (cemented-CPS), 4. Cement augmentation of EPS (cemented-EPS). Thirty-six consecutive patients with single-vertebral osteoporotic compressive fractures received posterior decompression and spinal fusion with cemented-CPS (16 cases) or cemented-EPS (20 cases). Plain film and/or CT scan were conducted to evaluate the spinal fusion and fixation effectiveness.
Results: 
The Fmax and energy absorption of cemented-EPS were significantly greater than three control groups. The mean BMD in the severe osteoporosis group was significantly lower than that in the osteoporosis group (t = 2.04, P = 0.036). In the osteoporosis group, cemented-EPS improved the Fmax by 43% and 21% over CPS and cemented-CPS group. In the severe osteoporosis group, cemented-EPS increased the Fmax by 59%, 22%, and 26% over CPS, EPS, and cemented-CPS, respectively. The clinical results showed that all patients suffered from severe osteoporosis. Six months after operation, the JOA and VAS scores in cemented-EPS group improved from 11.4 ± 2.6 and 7.0 ± 1.4 mm to 24.9 ± 1.6 and 2.1 ± 1.3 mm, respectively. No screw loosening occurred in the cemented-EPS group and spinal fusion was achieved. In the cemented-CPS group, four screws loosened (4.2%) according to the radiolucency. Six months after operation, the JOA and VAS scores improved from 13.1 ± 1.9 and 7.6 ± 1.5 mm to 22.8 ± 2.2 and 2.5 ± 1.6 mm, respectively. No cement leaked into the spinal canal in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Cemented-EPS could increase fixation strength biomechanically. It could reduce the risks of screw loosening in patients with severe osteoporosis, requiring instrumented arthrodesis.},

  abstract={The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate and compare the results of the technique so called 'two above one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site with long-segment posterior fusion in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. For this purpose neurologically intact 27 patients having isolated one level thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion in our clinic via 'two above-one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site. A control group consisting of 15 patients having one level thoracolumbar burst fracture treated with long segment posterior spinal fusion in our institute was formed. At the preoperative, postoperative and final follow up period, anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index values of both groups were noted. At the final follow up Visual Analogue Pain Scale and Oswestry disability scores were noted. Retrospective data from both groups underwent statistical analysis. In both groups anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index measurements improved at the final follow-up, but there was no significance between two groups in terms of radiological and clinical follow-up data. The loss of correction in local kyphosis of short-segment group in the interval between postoperative and follow-up period was also significant. No implant failure was noted. As a conclusion 'two above one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site is associated with loss of correction radiographically, but favorable clinical outcomes in the presence of any implant failure can be achieved in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
There is limited data on the pullout strength of spinal fixation devices in the thoracic spine among individuals with different bone quality. An in vitro biomechanical study on the thoracic spine was performed to compare the pullout strength and the mechanism of failure of 4 posterior fixation thoracic constructs in relation to bone mineral density (BMD).
Methods: 
A total of 80 vertebrae from 11 fresh-frozen thoracic spines (T2-12) were used. Based on the results from peripheral quantitative CT, specimens were divided into 2 groups (normal and osteopenic) according to their BMD. They were then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 different instrumentation systems (sublaminar wires, pedicle screws, lamina claw hooks, or pedicle screws with wires). The construct was completed with 2 titanium rods and 2 transverse connectors, creating a stable frame. The pullout force to failure perpendicular to the rods as well as the pattern of fixation failure was recorded.
Results: 
Mean pullout force in the osteopenic Group A (36 vertebrae) was 473.2 ± 179.2 N and in the normal BMD Group B (44 vertebrae) was 1414.5 ± 554.8 N. In Group A, no significant difference in pullout strength was encountered among the different implants (p = 0.96). In Group B, the hook system failed because of dislocation with significantly less force than the other 3 constructs (931.9 ± 345.1 N vs an average of 1538.6 ± 532.7 N; p = 0.02). In the osteopenic group, larger screws demonstrated greater resistance to pullout (p = 0.011). The most common failure mechanism in both groups was through pedicle base fracture.
Conclusions: 
Bone quality is an important factor that influences stability of posterior thoracic implants. Fixation strength in the osteopenic group was one-fourth of the value measured in vertebrae with good bone quality, irrespective of the instrumentation used. However, in normal bone quality vertebrae, the lamina hook claw system dislocated with significantly less force when compared with other spinal implants. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of different transpedicular screw designs on the pullout strength in normal and osteopenic thoracic spines.},

  abstract={Background: 
Alternative biocompatible filler materials replacing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement have been introduced and clinically tested. Callos calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is one of them. A prospective nonrandomized controlled study was performed to assess the clinical and radiologic results after balloon kyphoplasty with Callos CPC in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The degree of vertebral height loss and changes in the kyphotic angle were measured using plain-film x-rays. Blood tests were carried in all cases out to observe the variation in postoperative serum calcium levels.
Results: 
The VAS and ODI scores decreased from 7.5 ± 1.1 to 2.2 ± 1.4 (P = .000) and from 31.7 ± 1.6 to 16.9 ± 1.7 (P = .000), respectively. Although vertebral height loss (M = 25.4% ± 17.4%) was reduced after the operation (M=22.1% ± 15.3%, P = .002), recurrent progression of height loss was observed during the follow-up (M = 32.7% ± 19.6%, P = .001). The kyphotic angle (M = 8.1° ± 4.8°) did not significantly change postoperatively (M = 8.7° ± 5.5°, P = .350), and the serum calcium level was within normal ranges. CPC leakage to the spinal canal was observed in 15 cases (48.4%), and none of them presented any related clinical symptoms except one patient, who had transient intercostal neuralgia.
Conclusions: 
Subsequent loss of augmentation properties during follow-up is a serious problem of kyphoplasty using injectable CPC in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The clinical use of injectable CPC in kyphoplasty should be reconsidered.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Adjacent segment vertebral compression fracture after lumbosacral instrumented fusion has been reported to be a significant complication. Recently, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been widely used for the treatment of non-traumatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture. However, the clinical effect of this minimally invasive treatment option to the post-fusion vertebral fracture has rarely been reported. We analysed characteristics of adjacent vertebral fractures following lumbar fusion and evaluated the clinical outcome of PVP.
Methods: 
A total of 202 consecutive patients underwent PVP for compression fracture in our institute between January 2007 and December 2008. Among them, nine symptomatic adjacent vertebral fractures following lumbar fusion were identified. We randomly selected 50 control patients undergoing vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fracture in single level. We analysed the clinical data according to age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD). Clinical outcome was assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the rate of overall satisfaction.
Results: 
Fractures occurred at the cranial adjacent vertebra after fusion surgery in all cases. The mean BMD score for the spine and femur were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). After PVP, the mean VAS score improved from 8.1 to 3.2. The overall satisfaction rate was 88.9%. Other constitutional factors and clinical outcomes were similar to the control group.
Conclusion: 
Adjacent vertebral fracture following lumbar fusion may occur as a kind of adjacent segment disease. The increased stress around the fusion segment can cause vertebral fracture even with a relatively higher BMD score. Vertebroplasty for the post-fusion vertebral fracture can be as effective as it is for the usual osteoporotic vertebral fracture.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To prospectively evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures using Sextant system in the retrospective non-randomized case-control study.
Methods: 
A total of 38 consecutive non-randomized patients with type A thoracolumbar fractures, which had been stabilized posteriorly from December 2006 to March 2009, were examined retrospectively more than 9 months after surgery. Twenty-one patients had been treated conventionally with open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) and 17 patients received minimally invasive treatment with Sextant percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (SPPSF). As a method of evaluation, the incision size, the intraoperation and postoperative volume of blood loss, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, blood transfusion, the radiological assessment of the sagittal Cobb;s angle, vertebral body angle and vertebral body height were recorded and compared.
Results: 
All patients were followed up for 8-24 months (average 11.6 months). There were significant differences in the incision size, surgical blood loss, surgical draining loss, operation time, hospital stay after operation, blood transfusion, the proportion of antalgic supplement and postoperative incisional VAS between the two groups (P less than 0.05). Mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 16.0 degree and improved by 9.3 degree after surgery in OPSF group, but 15.2 degree and 10.3 degree respectively in SPPSF group. Mean preoperative angle of the fractured vertebral body was 15.9 degree and improved by 7.9 degree after surgery in OPSF group, but 14.9 degree and 6.6 degree respectively in SPPSF group. Mean anterior vertebral body height (% of normal) was 67.3% before surgery and 95.8% after surgery, but 69.1% and 90.1% respectively in SPPSF group. Mean posterior vertebral body height (% of normal) was 93.3% before surgery and 99.5% after surgery, but 88.9% and 93.3% respectively in SPPSF group. Among the patients whose 9-month follow-up films were available, 3.0 degree of kyphosis correction was lost in OPSF group, but 3.2 degree in SPPSF group. And 1.0 degree of the angle of the fractured vertebral body correction was lost in OPSF group, but 1.5 degree in SPPSF group. Then 3.0% of the anterior vertebral body height correction was lost in OPSF group, but 2.2% in SPPSF group. And 3.0% of the posterior vertebral body height correction was lost in OPSF group, but 2.5% in SPPSF group. The sagittal Cobb's angle, vertebral body angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra were all significantly different in each group before and after operation (P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in the postoperative sagittal Cobb's angle, vertebral body angle and the improvement of the vertebral body height and the kyphotic deformity correction between OPSF and SPPSF groups (P larger than 0.05), but there was significant difference in the postoperative anterior height of the fractured vertebra between the two groups (P less than 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The percutaneous pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra using Sextant system is a good minimally-invasive surgical therapeutic choice for patients with type A thoracolumbar fracture except for that the SPPSF has a little insufficiency in resuming the anterior height of the fractured vertebra compared with OPSF.},

  abstract={Short segment posterior fixation is the preferred method for stabilizing thoracolumbar fractures. In case of significant disruption of the anterior column, the simple short segment construct does not ensure adequate stability. In this study, we tried to evaluate the effect of inclusion of the fractured vertebra in short segment fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. In a prospective randomized study, eighty patients with thoracolumbar fractures treated just with posterior pedicular fixation were randomized into two groups receiving either the one level above and one level below excluding the fracture level (bridging group), or including the fracture level (including group). Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded and followed. A sum of 80 patients (42 patients in group 1 and 38 patients in group 2) were enrolled in the study. The patients in both the groups showed similar clinical outcome. There was a high rate of instrumentation failure in the "bridging" group. The "bridging" group showed a mean worsening (29%) in kyphosis, whereas the "including" group improved significantly by a mean of 6%. The significant effect of the "including" technique on the reduction of kyphotic deformity was most prominent in type C fractures. In conclusion, inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers a better kyphosis correction, in addition to fewer instrument failures, without additional complications, and with a comparable-if not better-clinical and functional outcome. We recommend insertion of screws into pedicles of the fractured thoracolumbar vertebra when considering a short segment posterior fixation, especially in Magerl type C fractures.},

  abstract={Opinions have varied regarding the optimal treatment of an unstable Hangman's fracture. C2 pedicle screw instrumentation is a biomechanically strong fixation which although done through a simple posterior approach, is a technically demanding procedure. This prospective, non-randomized multicentre study included 15 consecutive patients with displaced type II traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis. There were nine males and six females with a mean age of 37 years at surgery. The cause of injury was a road traffic accident in 11 patients and a fall from height in 4 patients. All patients had a single stage reduction and direct transpedicular screw fixation through the C2 pedicles. During follow-up, clinical evaluation and plain X-rays were performed at each visit; at 6-month follow-up, additional dynamic lateral flexion/extension views and a CT scan were performed. The average follow-up period was 32 months (range 25-56 months). At final follow-up, all patients were asymptomatic and regained a good functional outcome with no limitation of range of motion; all the patients showed solid union with no implant failure. There were no neurological complications. At 6-month follow-up, CT evaluation showed fusion in all patients and an adequate position of 28 screws. Two pedicle screws (6.6%) showed minimal (defined as <2 mm) intrusion; one into the spinal canal and the other into the vertebral foreamen. Transpedicular screw fixation through the C2 pedicles is a safe and effective method in treating type II traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis resulting in good clinical and radiological outcomes. Adequate reduction was achieved and motion segments were preserved with its use.},

  abstract={Study design: 
An in vivo clinical trial, and an in vitro cadaveric biomechanical and micromorphologic analysis.
Objective: 
To find the feasibility of using viscoplastic bone cement for vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty involved in bone cement reinforcement of fractured vertebra has shown promising clinical results. The most frequently observed complication of vertebroplasty is the cement leakage during surgery. Many methods were proposed and were successful at reducing the risk of leakage, such as creating a void within vertebra to reduce the injection pressure, increasing the cement viscosity to reduce the cement infiltration, etc. Nevertheless, a more cost-effective and safer surgery method is still the goal for many spine surgeons and researchers.
Methods: 
To deliver the viscoplastic bone cement into the vertebra, a unipedicular tract and a void in the vertebra was created using a curette. The viscoplastic bone cement was then delivered into the void piece by piece and tamped for compactness with a blunt end tool. For the in vitro biomechanical test, 7 thoracic vertebrae were used. The intact specimens were compressed to lose 25% of its intact height, and then augmented with viscoplastic bone cement. Postaugmentation CT scanning was taken to examine the cement distribution, leakage path, and cement filling ratio within the vertebra. Postaugmentation compression test was conducted to examine the vertebral strength and stiffness, and then compared with the intact ones. Finally, the vertebrae were cut into slices for micromorphologic analysis.
Results: 
The 6 in vivo clinical trials were all successfully operated with significant pain relief and showed no leakage during and after the surgery. The in vitro biomechanical test showed the cement augmentation significantly increased the vertebral strength (pre 3164 (229) N vs. post 3905 (484) N, P < 0.003), but tentatively decreased the vertebral stiffness (pre 1074 (74) N/mm vs. post 801 (370) N/mm, P = 0.081). The postaugmentation CT scanning showed the cement was well confined within the vertebra and the cement filling ratio was 21% (ranged from 15% to 29%). The depth that the viscoplastic bone cement infiltrated into the cancellous bone was 3.5 (0.6) mm, which is less than the depth [8.3 (2.2) mm, P < 0.001] of standard viscous bone cement vertebroplasty.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty using viscoplastic bone cement is clinically feasible and can effectively improve the vertebral strength and reduce the cement infiltration depth. The risk of cement leakage can also be decreased by using viscoplastic bone cement.},

Cadaveric biomechanical study.
Objective: 
To quantify the effects of vertebral body augmentation on biomechanics under axial compression by a total disc replacement (TDR) implant.
Summary of background data: 
TDR is a surgical alternative to lumbar spinal fusion to treat degenerative disc disease. Osteoporosis in the adjacent vertebrae to the interposed TDR may lead to implant subsidence or vertebral body fracture. Vertebral augmentation is used to treat osteoporotic compression fracture. This study sought to evaluate whether vertebral augmentation improves biomechanics under TDR axial loading.
Methods: 
Forty-five L1-L5 lumbar vertebral body segments with intact posterior elements were used. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans were performed to determine bone density, and specimens were block-randomized by bone density into augmentation and control groups. A semiconstrained keeled lumbar disc replacement device was implanted, providing 50% endplate coverage. Vertebral augmentation of 17.6% +/- 0.9% vertebral volume fill with Cortoss was performed on the augmentation group. All segments underwent axial compression at a rate of 0.2 mm/s to 6 mm.
Results: 
The load-displacement response for all specimens was nonlinear. Subfailure mechanical properties with augmentation were significantly different from control; in all cases, the augmented group was 2 times higher than control. At failure, the maximum load and stiffness with augmentation was not significantly different from control. The maximum apparent stress and modulus with augmentation were 2 times and 1.3 times greater than control, respectively. The subfailure stress and apparent modulus with augmentation were moderately correlated with bone density whereas the control subfailure properties were not. The augmented maximum stress was not correlated with bone density, whereas the control was weakly correlated. The maximum apparent modulus was moderately correlated with bone density for both the augmented and the control groups.
Conclusion: 
Augmentation improved the mechanical properties of the lumbar vertebral body for compression by a TDR implant.},

Conservative treatment comprises adequate analgesia, osteoporosis medication and individualized physiotherapy or braces. Nevertheless, vertebral compression fractures frequently lead to persisting pain and decrease daily activity and quality of life. In these cases, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty can be efficient treatment options. Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure, in which bone cement is filled into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic control. In most cases, this internal stabilization leads to a rapid reduction in pain. Kyphoplasty additionally aims to correct the kyphotic deformation of the broken vertebra via introducing and inflating a balloon catheter. There is broad clinical experience with both procedures. For kyphoplasty, randomized controlled trials showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life in patients undergoing kyphoplasty. However, cement leakages lead to rare but severe complications such as pulmonary embolism and nerve palsies.},

Clinical randomized study.
Objective: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is compared to conservative treatment in patients with acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral fractures with respect to pain, physical and mental outcomes. The risk of vertebral fractures adjacent to treated levels is assessed.
Summary of background data: 
There are some disagreements of the benefits of PVP for the treatment of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but the long-term clinical outcome of PVP compared to conservative treatment has not been evaluated in a randomized study.
Methods: 
The 3-months follow-up of this study has been published previously, and here we report the completed 12-months analysis. About 50 patients (41 females) were included from January 2001 until January 2008. Patients with vertebral fractures less than 8 weeks old were included and randomized to either PVP or conservative treatment. Pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Physical and mental outcomes were assessed by validated questionnaires and tests. Tests, questionnaires, and plain radiographs were performed at the inclusion and after 3 and 12 months.
Results: 
Pain score before and after the operation in the PVP group was 7.9 and 2.0, respectively. There was no difference between the groups concerning pain at the 3- and 12-months follow-up. Supplementary assessment of back pain 1 month after discharge from hospital showed a significant lower VAS score in the PVP group over the conservative group. In the study period, 2 adjacent fractures in the PVP group and no adjacent fractures in the conservative group were registered.
Conclusion: 
PVP is a good treatment for some patients with acute/subacute painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but the majority of fractures will heal after 8 to 12 weeks of conservative treatment with subsequent decline in pain. The risk of new fractures needs further research.},

Fifteen patients with low-energy trauma and 1-2 vertebral compression fractures verified by magnetic resonance imaging were recruited to undergo percutaneous bioceramic vertebral augmentation under fluoroscopy. The patients were treated with a highly flowable bioceramic containing calcium sulphate, hydroxyapatite and the non-ionic radiocontrast agent iohexol, with final setting time within 1 h. After the procedure, the patients were allowed to mobilize after 2 h. Pain (VAS), occurrence of remote and adjacent fractures, and Quality of Life (QoL; SF-36 and EQ-5D) was recorded during 18 months. The injected volume of the composite material ranged from 2.8 to 9 mL (mean 4.2 mL). Pre-operative VAS score was mean 70.3 (CI95% +/-8.7) with an immediate post-operative pain relief, which was maintained at the 4-week visit (mean 26.4 with CI95% +/-16.1) and 8-week visit (mean 18.0 with CI95% +/-13.5 pain relief). Eighty percent of the patients demonstrated a clinical improvement. The pain relief was maintained over 18 months and no adjacent fractures were observed. There was a statistically significant improvement of physical components in the QoL assessment. No extra-vertebral leakage or neurological deficits were reported in this series. This first prospective multicenter study on a partly resorbable bioceramic material indicate that fracture healing can be achieved with sustained pain relief over a follow-up period of 18 months in an osteoporotic patient population with vertebral compression fractures.},

In vitro biomechanical investigation.
Objective: 
To evaluate differences in biomechanical stability of vertebral compression fractures repaired using balloon kyphoplasty versus a titanium mesh implant.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebral compression fractures may be stabilized using an expandable balloon followed by cement injection. There are small but finite risks of endplate fracture and cement extravasation with this procedure. Alternative techniques may affect cement injection volumes, height maintenance, and biomechanical stability but require investigation.
Methods: 
Four male human cadaveric spines from T2 to L5 were used in this study. After determining bone mineral density, individual vertebral bodies were dissected and inspected for previous fractures or additional exclusion criteria. In the remaining vertebral bodies (n=48) anterior wedge fractures were created using a materials testing machine. Fractured vertebral bodies were systematically randomized to be repaired either with balloon kyphoplasty or with titanium mesh implant and polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, using image intensified fluoroscopy. Anterior vertebral body height (cm) was measured initially, after mechanically creating an anterior wedge fracture, after repairing the compression fracture with either technique, and after recompressing the vertebral body following a 24-hour cement polymerization period. Data for cement injection volume (mL) and height maintained following testing (cm) were compared between repair groups using a 1-way analysis of variance (P<0.05). Data for stiffness (N/mm), yield load (N), and ultimate load (N) were compared between intact bodies and repaired bodies using a 2-way analysis of variance (P<0.05).
Results: 
There was significantly less cement injected (P<0.001) and significantly greater height maintained (P<0.025) with the titanium implant group compared to the kyphoplasty group. There were no significant differences in biomechanical stability between the 2 groups (P>0.05).
Conclusion: 
The titanium implant was biomechanically equivalent to the kyphoplasty repair while necessitating less cement and providing greater height maintenance in vitro. Improvements in pain and function could not be specifically addressed in this in vitro study and should be evaluated in a clinical case series.},

In vitro biomechanical study on 6 fresh frozen human thoracolumbar spine specimens.
Objective: 
Using a novel high viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement and vertebroplasty kit to correct the kyphosis angle of wedge compression fractures (AO/ASIF 1.2).
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty is typically used to stabilize vertebral compression fractures in situ without correcting kyphosis, with the main target to reduce pain and disability. The vertebroplasty system investigated in this study comprises a high viscosity PMMA cement and uses a hydrostatic pressure hand piece for enhanced cement allocation and flow control. A recent clinical trial demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of cement leakage with this system.
Methods: 
Six spinal segments (Th11-L1 and Th12-L2) were loaded in a spine tester with pure moments of 7.5 Nm in lateral bending, flexion/extension and axial rotation. The segmental range of motion (ROM) was continuously recorded. The tested states of the specimens were: intact (a), fractured (b), treated with vertebroplasty (c), after loading with 50 to 250 N (d), 50 to 450 N (e) and 50 to 650 N (f) of 1000 cycles each. In each state (a-f), the kyphosis angle was documented fluoroscopically.
Results: 
Kyphosis angle was significantly reduced between intact and fractured states (P<0.02). Between treated and fractured states, we found highly significant difference (P<0.001), indicating full correction. During 3000 loading cycles (50-250, 50-450, and 50-650 N), the kyphosis angle remained constant compared to the treated state (P=1.0). We noted a logistic relationship between injected cement volume and extent of kyphosis correction (R=0.89, P<0.001). In the fractured state, the ROM in flexion/extension increased to 252% of the intact state (P<0.001). The vertebroplasty treatment decreased ROM to 72% of fractured state in flexion/extension (P<0.001). Macroscopic inspection of the vertebrae after testing showed an intact interface and tight mechanical interlocking of cement filling and trabecular bone.
Conclusion: 
High viscosity vertebroplasty effectively reduced and stabilized thoracolumbar wedge compression fractures and may represent a one-step solution for restoring vertebral body dimensions following thoracolumbar compression fractures, while minimizing the risk of cement leakage and associated complications in vivo.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporotic compression fractures (OVCFs) commonly occur in aged people, and as much as one-third of these fractures progress to chronic pain. Kyphoplasty (KP) is proved to be efficacious for pain relief and vertebral height restoration in chronic OVCFs, but there is still no data available about the clinical and radiographical outcomes compared by unipedicular and bipedicular KP in treating chronic painful OVCFs.
Purpose: 
To assess the clinical and radiographical outcomes in treating chronic painful OVCFs compared by unipedicular and bipedicular KP.
Methods: 
Fifty-eight patients with a total of sixty-six chronic painful OVCFs were enroled in our study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: group I (n=33) was treated with unipedicular KP and group II (n=25) with bipedicular KP. The operation times for each group were recorded and compared. Preoperative and postoperative of visual analogue scores (VAS) and oswestry disability index (ODI) scores were compared 2 weeks after surgery within each group and between groups. The radiographic outcomes were evaluated by the restoration rate (RR) in the most compressed point of the vertebral bodies.
Results: 
Significant improvement on the VAS, ODI scores and RR was noted in each group (p<0.001), and there is no significant difference existing in clinical outcomes between the two groups. The mean operation time for each vertebra in group I was significantly shorter than in group II (p<0.001). But the RR in group II was higher than in group I (p=0.041).
Conclusion: 
Both unipedicular kyphoplasty and bipedicular kyphoplasty can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes in treating the chronic painful OVCFs and the operation time is shorter in unipedicular kyphoplasty. However, the bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in height restoration.},

  abstract={Burst fractures are common in the thoracolumbar junction and account for 17% of all major spinal fractures. There is a considerable controversy on the efficacy of conservative treatment and the need for surgical intervention. Need for additional stability, prevention of neurological deterioration, attainment of canal clearance, prevention of kyphosis and early relief of pain are the commonly quoted reasons for surgical intervention. However, a careful review of literature does not validate any of the above arguments. The available randomised control trials prove that the results of conservative treatment for burst fractures are equal to that of surgery and also with lesser complications. Surgery for burst fractures may, however, have definite advantages in patients with polytrauma or in the rare event of deteriorating neurology. It is also important for the treating surgeon to clearly distinguish a burst fracture from other inherently unstable injuries like fracture dislocations, chance fractures and flexion rotation injuries which require surgical stabilisation.},

  abstract={Study design: 
In this prospective randomized study, the results of treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures by pedicle instrumentation with and without fracture level screw combination were given.
Objective: 
Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of fracture level screw combination in achieving and maintaining correction in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Most authors reported that intraoperative correction of sagittal deformity is important for the maintenance of fracture reduction and is one of the most consistent predictor of satisfactory functional outcome.
Methods: 
Seventy-two patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomized into 4 groups with equal number of patients. In group 1, patients were treated by segmental posterior instrumentation with 2 levels above and 2 levels below the fracture level fixation, in group 2 they were treated as in group 1 with fracture level screw incorporation. In group 3, patients were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation with 1 level above and 1 level below, in group 4 they were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation. Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and at follow-up.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 50 months. Fracture level screw combination provided better intraoperative correction and maintenance in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, which was more prevalent in short-segment fixation group.
Conclusions: 
Reinforcement with fracture level screw combination can help to provide better kyphosis correction and offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the methods for, and clinical outcome of, the operative treatment of thoracolumbar fractures through an approach via the paravertebral muscle (PVM).
Methods: 
From June 2005 to August 2006, 62 patients, comprising 48 men and 14 women with an average age of 45.2 years (range, 21-58) with thoracolumbar fractures without neurological involvement underwent surgical treatment. Twenty-one fractures were located at T12, 24 at L1 and 17 at L2. The study comprised 15 compression and 47 burst fractures with an intact posterior column. Thirty-four cases were selected randomly to undergo surgery through the above approach, while the other 28 cases underwent the traditional procedure. After making a posterior midline incision, which not only facilitates insertion of pedicle screws and fusion of the graft bone at facet joints, but spares the attachment of PVM, the interval between the longissimus and multifidus muscles was undermined. Drainage was not routinely needed and the patients became ambulant with a brace earlier post-operatively.
Results: 
The new approach had statistically significant advantages (P < 0.005) over the traditional one in regard to blood loss, drainage, duration of recumbency and visual analogue scale (VAS), although the time required was almost the same for the two procedures. Till August 2007, 56 patients were successfully followed up for 12 to 26 months (mean, 18.6) and bone fusion was identified in all cases. Neither reduction loss nor loosening or breakage of the fixation occurred.
Conclusion: 
The technique of operating through an approach between the PVM is recommended for thoracolumbar fractures because it is much less invasive, can reduce blood loss and accelerates rehabilitation.},

  abstract={We aimed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty (PVP) using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in patients with symptomatic metastatic spine lesions. We included 31 patients in this retrospective study who were treated with PMMA from 2003 to 2005 for intractable pain due to metastatic spine lesions. The types of cancer (and numbers of patients) included: lung cancer (9), breast cancer (7), gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers (5), hepatobiliary malignancies (3), and other types of cancer (7). All patients received vertebroplasty, resulting in 41 treatments (16 in thoracic, 25 in lumbar spine). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were measured in all patients. Image studies including contrast-enhanced MRI were performed in all patients. Results showed characteristic metastatic lesions. Suspicious lesions were further confirmed as malignant by a bone scan, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and pathological exam. Vertebroplasty resulted in complete or partial pain relief in 29 patients (95%), and provided no pain relief in 2 patients (5%). The mean preoperative VAS score of 8.9 (+/-0.93) was higher than the mean postoperative VAS score (2.6+/-1.71). Metastatic spine lesions were most common in lung and breast cancer patients and these lesions were located more often on segments T12 to L2 (53.6%). Patients with malignancy of hepatobiliary origin did not show improvement in pain scores as dramatically as patients with other types of malignancies, although only a few cases were included in this study. No patients experienced worsening of symptoms or suffered from vertebroplasty complications. We conclude that vertebroplasty is a safe, effective, and simple treatment for the management of intractable spinal pain due to metastases.},

  abstract={In a prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of kyphoplasty (KP) and vertebroplasty (VP) as complementary techniques in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). After 1 month of conservative treatment for VCFs, patients with intractable pain were offered treatment with KP or VP according to a treatment algorithm that considers time from fracture (Delta t) and amount of vertebral body collapse. Bone biopsy was obtained intra-operatively to exclude patients affected by malignancy or osteomalacia. 164 patients were included according to the above criteria. Mean age was 67.6 years. Mean follow-up was 33 months. 10 patients (6.1%) were lost to follow-up and 154 reached the minimum 2-year follow-up. 118 (69.5%) underwent VP and 36 (30.5%) underwent KP. Complications affected five patients treated with VP, whose one suffered a transient intercostal neuropathy and four a subsequent VCF (two at adjacent level). Results in terms of visual analogue scale and Oswestry scores were not different among treatment groups. In conclusion, at an average follow-up of almost 3 years from surgical treatment of osteoporotic VCFs, VP and KP show similar good clinical outcomes and appear to be complementary techniques with specific different indications.},

  abstract={Background: 
The impact of fusion as a supplement to short-segment instrumentation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is unclear. We conducted a controlled clinical trial to define the effect of fusion on lumbar spine and patient-related functional outcomes.
Methods: 
From 2000 to 2002, seventy-three consecutive patients with a single-level Denis type-B burst fracture involving the thoracolumbar spine and a load-sharing score of <or=6 were managed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with posterolateral fusion (fusion group, n = 37) or without posterolateral fusion (nonfusion group, n = 36). The patients were followed for at least five years after surgery and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with use of the Frankel scale, the motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, a visual analog scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Radiographic outcomes were assessed on the basis of the local kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.
Results: 
No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between the patients managed with the two techniques. Both operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the nonfusion group compared with the fusion group (p < 0.05). Twenty-five of the thirty-seven patients in the fusion group still had some degree of donor-site pain at the time of the latest examination.
Conclusions: 
Posterolateral bone-grafting is not necessary when a Denis type-B thoracolumbar burst fracture associated with a load-sharing score of <or=6 is treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation.},

  abstract={Sacral insufficiency fractures can cause severe, debilitating pain to patients concerned. The incidence of this fracture type correlates with the appearance of osteoporosis in the elderly population. A polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement injection procedure called sacroplasty has been recently described as an optional method for the treatment of this fracture type. However, the correct cement placement in the complex anatomical structure of the sacrum is a surgical challenge. The aim of the study is to compare the precision, safety, and radiation exposure of standard multiplanar fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) guidance for PMMA application to the sacrum using both balloon-assisted sacroplasty and conventional sacroplasty. A controlled experimental investigation in a human cadaver trial has been performed. Two imaging and two application modalities to monitor percutaneous PMMA injection to the sacrum were examined. The application forms were randomized from side to side of the pelvis. We found less cement extravasation in the CT-guided groups, but also a significant higher radiation exposure (P < 0.05) by using CT guidance. The conventional fluoroscopy-guided sacroplasty revealed the shortest procedure time (incision to closure time) of all treatment groups (P < 0.01). These findings show no difference regarding cement extravasation between ballon-assisted and conventional sacroplasty. Further, in comparison to fluoroscopy-assisted technique, the CT-guided cement injection seems to decrease the risk of cement extravasation, irrespective of the use of an additional balloon assistance. However, we have to consider a greater radiation exposure using CT guidance. Further investigations will proof the suitability in the normal course of clinical life.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective randomized controlled clinical study.
Objective: 
To investigate the feasibility of a calcium phosphate cement (CaP) in balloon kyphoplasty if compared to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
Summary of background data: 
In kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, PMMA currently represents the standard in augmentation materials. It is characterized, however, by a lack of osseointegration and limited biocompatibility. Consequently, CaP is currently being investigated as an alternative material for vertebral augmentation.
Methods: 
Inclusion criteria were 1 or 2 adjacent osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies in the thoracolumbar spine, patient age > or =65 years, and fracture age < or =4 months. Exclusion criteria were tumor lesions and additional posterior instrumentation.
Results: 
A total of 60 osteoporotic vertebral body fractures in 56 patients were included. CaP and PMMA were randomly applied in 30 vertebrae each with 2-fracture-patients receiving only 1 type of cement for both vertebrae. All 60 fractures were classified compression fractures (type A). Of these, 27 were classified burst fractures (type A3). 52/56 patients experienced statistically significant pain relief (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 1.8 +/- 2.1 on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 "best" to 10 "worst"). Bisegmental endplate angles were restored by 6.2 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees on average. Complications that turned out to be cement-specific were: vascular embolism (n = 2) for PMMA; subtotal cement washout (n = 1); and radiographic loss of correction (n = 9) due to cement failure in burst fractures for CaP. There was no case of cement failure, when PMMA had been used.
Conclusion: 
The routine use of the CaP tested is not currently recommended for kyphoplasty. Because of its low resistance against flexural, tractive, and shear forces compared to PMMA, in certain constellations (burst fractures), there is a higher risk of cement failure and subsequent loss of correction.},

The orthopaedic surgeons knew that fragility fractures in patient over 50 years old require investigation for osteoporosis. Although some surgeons agreed to initiate investigation and inform patient about new osteoporosis fracture risk, the majority did not institute medical treatment and thought that the patient primary care provider or rheumatologist should be responsible for medical care.

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebroplasty is a promising but as yet unproven treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. It involves radiographic-guided injection of various types of bone cement directly into the vertebral fracture site. Uncontrolled studies and two controlled quasi-experimental before-after studies comparing volunteers who were offered treatment to those who refused it, have suggested an early benefit including rapid pain relief and improved function. Conversely, several uncontrolled studies and one of the controlled before-after studies have also suggested that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae adjacent to treated levels or if cement leakage into the adjacent disc has occurred. As yet, there are no completed randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The aims of this participant and outcome assessor-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to i) determine the short-term efficacy and safety (3 months) of vertebroplasty for alleviating pain and improving function for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; and ii) determine its medium to longer-term efficacy and safety, particularly the risk of further fracture over 2 years.
Design: 
A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 200 participants with one or two recent painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Participants will be stratified by duration of symptoms (< and >or= 6 weeks), gender and treating radiologist and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Outcome measures include overall, night and rest pain on 10 cm visual analogue scales, quality of life measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life, Osteoporosis Quality of Life and EQ-5D questionnaires; participant perceived recovery on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 'a great deal worse' to 'a great deal better'; disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; timed 'Up and Go' test; and adverse effects. The presence of new fractures will be assessed by radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine performed at 12 and 24 months.
Discussion: 
The results of this trial will be of major international importance and findings will be immediately translatable into clinical practice.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the clinical efficacy of percutaneous bipediculary kyphoplasty with double or single balloon I treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compressive fractures.
Methods: 
Fifty-one patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture involving 69 vertebrae. 19 males and 32 females, aged 72.5 (63 - 85), underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty with double inflatable balloon (29 cases, 38 vertebrae) or single inflatable balloon (22 cases, 31 vertebrae) under X-ray fluoroscopy monitoring. The fractured vertebral bodies were punctuated, balloon was put into the subsided areas and then distended, and bone cement was injected into the cavity. The vertebral height and Cobb angle, preoperative and postoperative, were measured by radiography. Follow-up was conducted for 6 - 12 months.
Results: 
All patients tolerated the procedure well with dramatic pain relief within 96 hours after the procedure. No clinical complication was found. Visual analog scale score was improved from 7.8 preoperatively to 2.6 postoperatively (P < 0.01). Oswestry disability index was decreased from 73% preoperatively to 26% postoperatively. In the double balloon group, the heights loss of the anterior and middle portions of the vertebral body reduced from 14.7 mm and 10.5 mm to 10.1 mm and 5.5 mm respectively (both P < 0.01), and the Cobb angle was corrected from 22.4 degrees to 12.3 degrees (P < 0.01). In the single balloon group, the heights loss of the anterior and middle portions of the vertebral body reduced from 14.7 mm and 10.6 mm to 10.4 mm and 6.5 mm respectively (both P < 0.01), and the. Cobb angle was corrected averagely from 21.2 degrees to 11.6 degrees (P < 0.01). The mean vertebral height restoration rates were 72.8% and 70.1% in the double and single balloon groups respectively. The mean Cobb angle correct degrees were 10.1 degrees and 9.5 degrees in double and single balloon groups respectively. There were no significant differences in the average height restoration rate and Cobb angle correction between the double and single balloon groups (72.8% vs 70.1%, and 10.0 degrees vs 9.5 degrees both P > 0.05). The pain relief and functional recovery were substantial and maintained to the last follow up.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous bipediculary kyphoplasty with double or single balloon for painful osteoporotic vertebral body compressive fractures is effective and safe.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to elucidate the feasibility of microendoscopic discectomy (MED) for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with a bony fragment due to apophyseal separation. Eighteen patients with low back pain and unilateral sciatic pain due to lumbar disc herniation with a bony fragment were treated by MED using the unilateral approach (15 males and three females; mean age, of 28.9 years; mean follow-up period, 21.1 months); 18 age-and sex-matched patients with lumbar disc herniation without a bony fragment treated by MED served as the control group. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association Score for Low Back Pain (JOA scores; maximum score, 29 points). Evaluation of the results revealed that good surgical outcomes equivalent to those in the control group were obtained in the subjects of LDH with a bony fragment (JOA scores; 14.1+/-3.5 in the patient group vs.15.4+/-2.6 in the control group before surgery; 26.3+/-1.8 in the patient group vs. 26.9+/-1.3 at follow-up after the surgery). Although the mean surgical time was significantly longer in the patient group, there were no intra- or postoperative complications in either group. We conclude that MED using the unilateral approach is a feasible minimally invasive surgical option for patients of lumbar disc herniation with an apophyseal bony fragment.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Evaluation of a novel, leakage-free vertebroplastic instrumentation by fresh cadaveric studies.
Objectives: 
To compare Vessel-X, a novel percutaneous bone void filling container system, with conventional kyphoplasty in restoring strength, stiffness, and height in experimentally induced vertebral compressive fractures and morphologically determine the cement distribution.
Summary of background data: 
Clinically, both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty perform well in reinforcement and pain relief. One of the shortcomings, however, is the risk of cement leakage. Vessel-X is a novel bone expander and bone void filler combined instrumentation for vertebral augmentation requiring evaluation.
Methods: 
A total of 28 fresh-frozen vertebral specimens were randomly assigned to 4 groups for testing: unipedicular kyphoplasty, bipedicular kyphoplasty, unipedicular Vessel-X, and bipedicular Vessel-X. Compressive fractures were experimentally created on each vertebra after determining the bone mineral density. Kyphoplasty and Vessel-X were performed using bioactive bone cement (SrHAC) under C-arm fluoroscopy and compared by compression testing to measure the effects of augmentation. Morphologic observations were also performed to determine the cement distribution and vertebral height restoration.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in bone mineral density, initial strength, and stiffness in any of the groups. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in total cement volume in intragroup comparison within the unipedicular or bipedicular groups. Vessel-X bone filler container could expand well and contain most of the cement. The height restoration ranged from 88.5% to 96.4% in all groups. The augmented strength with unipedicular and bipedicular injections reached 3651.57 N and 4833.73 N, respectively. Stiffness with bipedicular injection was significantly higher than that of unipedicular injection.
Conclusion: 
Vessel-X was comparable to kyphoplasty in restoring the mechanical properties and height of the fractured vertebrae. Interestingly, Vessel-X instrumentation showed considerably less cement leakage and better cement placement in the vertebral body. Therefore, it could be a leakage controllable technique in percutaneous vertebral augmentation.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To measure the cervical pedicles and assess the feasibility of transpedicular fixation in a Malay population.
Methods: 
960 computed tomography (CT) scans of bilateral C2 to C7 pedicles of 80 Malays were compared. 22 men and 24 women aged <60 (mean, 37.3; range, 18-56) years were defined as young patients, whereas 18 men and 16 women aged 60 or over (mean, 63.9; range, 60-76) years as elderly patients. An inner diameter of <3.0 mm (85% of a 3.5-mm screw) was defined as 'unfeasible' and a medial or lateral wall thickness of <1.0 mm as 'unsafe' for cervical pedicle screw fixation.
Results: 
In the respective young versus elderly groups, the inner diameters ranged from 1.94 to 2.80 mm versus 2.51 to 3.37 mm in men, and from 1.52 to 2.31 mm versus 1.64 to 2.46 mm in women. Medial wall thickness ranged from 1.25 to 1.46 mm versus 1.13 to 1.48 mm in men, and from 1.28 to 1.72 mm versus 1.10 to 1.24 mm in women. Lateral wall thickness ranged from 0.80 to 0.90 mm versus 0.66 to 0.88 mm in men, and from 0.85 to 0.99 mm versus 0.59 to 0.86 mm in women.
Conclusion: 
The cervical spine of Malays may not be adequate to accommodate a 3.5-mm pedicle screw for transpedicular fixation, as this procedure may risk adjacent vital structures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective observational cohort study of consecutive osteoporotic patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (SIFs).
Objective: 
Assess the safety and efficacy of sacroplasty in treating osteoporotic SIFs.
Summary of background data: 
SIFs can cause low back pain in osteoporotic patients. Symptomatic improvement may require up to 12 months. Treatment includes limited weight-bearing and bed rest, oral analgesics, and sacral corsets. Significant mortality and morbidity are associated with pelvic insufficiency fractures. Percutaneous sacroplasty is an alternative treatment for SIF patients, and initial reports have documented its safe and effective performance. Yet, follow-up intervals have been short, and study cohorts small precluding definitive assessment of sacroplasty's safety and efficacy.
Methods: 
Baseline Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), analgesic usage, and duration of symptoms were recorded. Subsequent VAS ratings were assessed at 30 minutes and at 2, 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks postprocedure. Analgesic usage and patient satisfaction were assessed at final follow-up. Each procedure was performed under intravenous conscious sedation using fluoroscopy. Two bone trochars were inserted between the sacral foramen and sacroiliac joint through which 2 to 3 mL of polymethylmethacrylate was injected.
Results: 
Thirty-seven patients, 27 females, were treated. Mean age was 76.6 years, and mean symptom duration was 34.4 days. All patients were available at each follow-up interval except 1 patient who died due to unrelated pulmonary disease before the 4-week follow-up. The mean VAS score at baseline was 7.7 and 3.2 within 30 minutes, and 2.1 at 2, 1.7 at 4, 1.3 at 12, 1.0 at 24, and 0.7 at 52 weeks postprocedure. Improvement at each interval and overall was statistically significant using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. One case of transient S1 radiculitis was encountered.
Conclusions: 
Sacroplasty appears to be a safe and effective treatment for painful SIF. The rate of improvement is rapid and sustained through 1 year.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Cadaveric biomechanical study and retrospective chart review.
Objective: 
Biomechanical comparison of segmental versus nonsegmental fixation of lumbar burst fractures and clinical analysis of short-term radiographic outcomes.
Summary of background data: 
Traditional short nonsegmental posterior fixation of thoracolumbar burst fractures suffers from high rates of failure. Construct stability may be improved by inserting additional screws at the fracture level.
Methods: 
Six intact human spines (L1-L3) were biomechanically tested in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial torsion. The inferior half of the L2 vertebral bodies and L2-L3 discs were resected to mimic an unstable L2 burst fracture with loss of anterior column support. Pedicle screws were inserted in L1 and L3 for the control group (nonsegmental fixation). Screws were inserted at all levels for the experimental group (segmental fixation). Construct stiffness and L1-L2 disc pressure were analyzed. Twelve patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with this type of segmental fixation were reviewed.
Results: 
Construct stiffness during axial torsion was significantly higher for segmental constructs compared with nonsegmental constructs (P < 0.02) with no differences between flexion-extension and lateral bending. Disc pressure fluctuations during flexion-extension were significantly higher for segmental compared with nonsegmental constructs (P < 0.02), with no differences in lateral bending and torsion. Mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 9 degrees and improved by 15 degrees after surgery. Follow-up films on 9 patients showed 5 degrees of kyphosis correction loss. Mean anterior vertebral body height was 58% of normal before surgery. After surgery height was 89% of normal and at final follow-up, 78%.
Conclusions: 
Segmental fixation of burst fractures with screws at the level of the fracture offers improved biomechanical stability. Theoretically, segmental fixation provides for additional fixation points that may aid in fracture reduction and kyphosis correction. This specific parameter is not evaluated in this study but will be an important outcome measure for a planned randomized controlled trial.},

  abstract={We have used software, recently developed at Cochin University of Science and Technology, to perform computer assisted pedicle screw placement in forty pedicles of ten patients with fractured thoracolumbar vertebrae from January 2002 to February 2004. A pre-operative CT scan section at the pedicle level is taken one vertebra above and one below the involved vertebra. The dicom image is converted into a bitmap image and reference lines are drawn through the transverse processes and the spinous processes. The screw trajectory is drawn in the image at the most suitable path of the pedicle. Intraoperatively reference pins are placed exactly at the same areas in the transverse processes and the spinous processes. The intraoperative image is live captured using a camera and is matched with the preoperative image and the awl is advanced into the pedicle corresponding to the screw trajectory in the CT image. Out of forty pedicles instrumented in ten patients using computer assistance, the pedicle wall violation as demonstrated with 1 mm thin CT scans was less than AMIOT Grade 2. Ideal placement was noted in 80% and clinically insignificant perforation (Grade 2&3) in the rest. Computer assisted pedicle screw fixation appears to be a good technique for the accurate placement of pedicle screws in fractured vertebrae.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective clinical trial was conducted.
Objectives: 
To compare the results of fusion versus nonfusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine.
Summary of background data: 
The operative results of surgically treated burst fractures with short segmental fixation have been well documented. There is no report comparing the results of fusion and nonfusion.
Methods: 
Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, with the inclusion criteria as follows: neurologically intact spine with a kyphotic angle > or = 20 degrees, decreased vertebral body height > or = 50% or a canal compromise > or = 50%, incomplete neurologic deficit with a canal compromise 50%, complete neurologic deficit, and multilevel spinal injury or multiple traumas. All patients were randomly assigned to fusion or nonfusion groups, and operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation was carried out. Posterior fusion with autogenous bone graft was performed for the fusion group (n = 30), and no fusion procedure was done for the nonfusion group (n = 28). The average follow-up period was 41 months (range, 24-71 months).
Results: 
The average loss of kyphotic angle was not statistically significant between these 2 groups. The radiographic parameters were statistically significantly better in the nonfusion group, including angular change in the flexion-extension lateral view (4.8 degrees vs. 1.0 degrees), lost correction of decreased vertebral body height (3.6% vs. 8.3%), intraoperative estimated blood loss (303 mL vs. 572 mL), and operative time (162 minutes vs. 224 minutes). The scores on the low back outcome scale were not statistically significant for these 2 groups.
Conclusions: 
The short-term results of short segmental fixation without fusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were satisfactory. The advantages of instrumentation without fusion are the elimination of donor site complications, saving more motion segments, and reducing blood loss and operative time.},

  abstract={Background: 
The purpose of this article is to report experience gained over three years of the use of a protocol for patient selection and timing of operation for acute thoracic and lumbar fractures.
Method: 
At admission, all patients underwent neurological and imaging exams. All patients with a spinal cord lesion scored as ASIA A at any level inferior to T10 and as ASIA B, C or D at any level, were categorized as emergency and operated on within eight hours from trauma. ASIA A cases in the T1-T10 tract and ASIA E cases at any level were treated in the ordinary operative work schedule.
Findings: 
Ninety-four patients with surgically treated lumbar or thoracic fractures took part in this study. On the imaging studies, 12 patients were classified as A, 50 as B and 32 as C following the AO classification. At the neurological exam, 39 patients were scored as ASIA A, nine as B, six as C, two as D and 38 as E. At follow-up, of the 39 patients scored as ASIA A, 13 (33%) improved at least one grade and of the 17 scored as ASIA B, C or D, 11 (64.7%) improved. None of the 38 patients scored as ASIA E deteriorated.
Conclusions: 
The findings show that the strategy in the protocol was safe and followed by satisfactory rates of neurological outcome. Larger prospective studies, preferably randomized, are needed to establish definitively its place in the management of patients with spinal injury.},

Results: 
Of 45 patients, 25 returned to pre-injury activities within 1 year and 29 of 39 within 20 months. Two-thirds of the patients who were followed up returned to their job. After 1 year 25 of 45 patients had no or mild limitations in their back function. Six months later this group decreased to 6 of 39 patients. Visual analog scale (VAS) decreased from 87/100 preoperatively to 65/100 at the 1-year follow-up. The average permanent reduction of the injured vertebrae was 16.9 degrees including 2.3 degrees loss of correction.
Conclusion: 
After reconstruction of the anterior column with the Synex implant only a minimal loss of correction or reduction was observed. The clinical outcome after use of the Synex implant appears promising. We recommend this implant as a valuable alternative for reconstruction of the anterior column of the thoracolumbar spine. However, long-term results are still required.},

  abstract={Study design: 
We report on a prospective selective case series of 17 patients with cervical fracture-dislocations treated with closed reduction under MRI guidance.
Objective: 
To demonstrate the safe and effective use of in-line axial traction in the reduction of cervical fracture-dislocations using MRI guidance.
Summary of background data: 
Closed reduction of the cervical spine for acute fracture-dislocations has been a traditional technique used for restoring vertebral alignment and providing neural element decompression. The safety of this technique has been questioned, with concerns of disc migration and overdistraction causing neurologic worsening cited as reasons to choose operative reduction and decompression as a safer option in some circumstances.
Methods: 
Seventeen patients with fracture-dislocations of the subaxial cervical spine were given a trial of traction under MRI guidance between 1999 and 2003. The incidence of posteriorly herniated disc material was noted, and the diameter of the spinal canal at the injured level was recorded before and after traction.
Results: 
All patients tolerated traction without neurologic worsening. Pretraction disc disruption was found in 15 of 17 (88.2%) of patients, with posterior herniation in 4 of 17 (23.5\%). Traction caused a return of herniated disc material toward the disc space in all cases. Canal dimensions improved in 11 of 17 patients, with canal diameter increasing by a factor of 1.1 to 3.0, with a mean improvement of 1.73. The process of reduction was observed to be a gradual one, with progressive, significant improvement in canal dimensions occurring before anatomic realignment. As distracting force was increased, sequential MRIs showed that canal dimensions did not diminish at any time in any patient.
Conclusions: 
MRI monitoring in closed cervical reduction is a useful research tool for this technique. Closed reduction appears to be safe as used in this preliminary study and is effective in achieving immediate spinal cord decompression.},

  abstract={Cement augmentation using PMMA cement is known as an efficient treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with a rapid release of pain in most patients and prevention of an ongoing kyphotic deformity of the vertebrae treated. However, after a vertebroplasty there is no chance to restore vertebral height. Using the technique of kyphoplasty a certain restoration of vertebral body height can be achieved. But there is a limitation of recovery due to loss of correction when deflating the kyphoplastic ballon and before injecting the cement. In addition, the instruments used are quite expensive. Lordoplasty is another technique to restore kyphosis by indirect fracture reduction as it is used with an internal fixateur. The fractured and the adjacent vertebrae are instrumented with bone cannulas bipediculary and the adjacent vertebrae are augmentated with cement. After curing of the cement the fractured vertebra is reduced by applying a lordotic moment via the cannulas. While maintaining the pretension the fractured vertebra is reinforced. We performed a prospective trial of 26 patients with a lordoplastic procedure. There was a pain relief of about 87% and a significant decrease in VAS value from 7.3 to 1.9. Due to lordoplasty there was a significant and permanent correction in vertebral and segmental kyphotic angle about 15.2 degrees and 10.0 degrees , respectively and also a significant restoration in anterior and mid vertebral height. Lordoplasty is a minimal invasive technique to restore vertebral body height. An immediate relief of pain is achieved in most patients. The procedure is safe and cost effective.},

Prospective randomized study. OBJECTIVES.: To compare the results of the combined anterior-posterior surgery (Group A) with posterior "short-segment" transpedicular fixation (SSTF) (Group B) in mid-lumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
There are no comparative randomized clinical studies on the outcome following operative treatment of mid-lumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Forty consecutive patients with L2-L4 fresh single A3-type/AO burst fractures and load sharing score up to 6 were randomly selected to underwent either combined one-stage anterior stabilization with mesh cage and SSTF (Group A) or solely SSTF with intermediate screws in the fractured vertebra (Group B). Kyphotic Gardner angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height (PVBHr, AVBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), SF-36, VAS, and Frankel classification were used.
Results: 
The follow-up observation averaged 46 and 48 months for Group A and B, respectively. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were significant more in Group A. More surgical complications were observed in the Group A. After surgery, VAS was reduced to 4.3 and 3.6 for Group A and Group B, respectively. The SF-36 domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in Group B (P = 0.05) and (P = 0.06), respectively. Correction of AVBHr, PVBHr, and spinal canal clearance was similar in both groups. Spinal canal clearance did not differ between the two groups, but it was continuous until the last evaluation in Group B. The final Gardner angle loss of correction averaged 2 degrees and 5 degrees for Group A and Group B, respectively. The posttraumatic Gardner deformity did not significantly improve by SSTF at the final evaluation in the spines of Group B. Gardner angle correlated significantly with SCE in Group B and Group A in all three periods and in the last evaluation, respectively. Frankel grade did not correlate with loss of correction of AVBHr and PVBHr in Group A, while it significantly correlated with loss of PVBHr correction and SCE in the patients of Group B. There was no neurologic deterioration after surgery in any patient. VAS and SF-36 scores did not significantly correlate with the loss of kyphotic angle correction and AVBHr, PVBHr at the final observation in any patient of both groups.
Conclusions: 
SSTF offered similar significant short-term correction of posttraumatic deformities associated with mid-lumbar A3-burst fractures, but better clinical results as compared to combined surgery. However, SSTF did not significantly maintain the after surgery achieved correction of local posttraumatic kyphosis at the final evaluation. Thus, SSTF is not recommended for operative stabilization of fractures with this severity.},

  abstract={Object: 
In this study the authors evaluated levels of radiation exposure to surgeons' protected and unprotected hands during fluoroscopically assisted vertebroplasty.
Methods: 
The amount of radiation administered to 30 patients during 41 procedures in a controlled prospective trial over 6 months was assessed, comparing radiation exposure to the right and left hands in two neurosurgeons. Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively.
Conclusions: 
This study emphasizes the importance of surgeons wearing lead glove protection on their leading hands during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures and demonstrates a 75% reduction rate of exposure to radiation.},

This study compares radiation exposure, surgical time, and accuracy of hardware placement using standard fluoroscopy versus computer-assisted fluoroscopy-based navigation ("virtual fluoroscopy") to assist with the placement of odontoid screws. Twenty-two cadavers were divided into two groups and underwent placement of a single odontoid screw using either standard fluoroscopic or virtual fluoroscopic guidance. Following screw placement, dissection of the C1-C2 segments was performed to assess accuracy. A significant reduction in fluoroscopy time was noted with the computer-based fluoroscopy technique, whereas the surgical time was not found to differ significantly between the techniques. No critical breaches (those risking neurovascular injury) were noted in either group, and the rate of noncritical breaches did not differ. The authors conclude that fluoroscopy-based virtual navigation appears to have a safety profile similar to standard fluoroscopy while allowing a reduction in radiation exposure.},

  abstract={Percutaneous vertebroplasty has become an efficient technique for the treatment of painful vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are characterized by severe back pain and immobilization causing other complications like thrombosis or pneumonia. Vertebral cement augmentation provides increased strength of the vertebral body and an obvious pain relief. Between 1989 and 2004, 30 studies and a total of 2,086 treated patients have been published in literature. A review of these studies has been performed. The number and age of the patients, number of treated vertebrae, pre- and postoperative outcome of pain and complications of the different studies were assessed and analyzed. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient technique with low complication rates and a significant reduction in pain. It rapidly improves the mobility and quality of life of patients with vertebral compression fractures. With an increasing number of treated patients, experience with this interventional technique has become excellent. But still there are no randomized controlled trials available, showing that percutaneous vertebroplasty has a significantly better outcome than other treatment options, especially after a long-term follow-up.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To prospectively compare the vertebral height restoration achieved with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in fresh cadavers by using multi-detector row computed tomography (CT).
Materials and methods: 
Institutional review board approval was not required because the donors had registered in and consented to an anatomic gift program prior to their death. Thirty-seven vertebrae were harvested from four donated cadavers of elderly female individuals (mean age, 82 years; age range at death, 73-87 years). The vertebrae were dissected free of the surrounding muscles and imaged with multi-detector row CT. Compression fractures were induced, and the vertebrae were again imaged. The vertebrae were randomized to be treated with kyphoplasty (n = 19) or vertebroplasty (n = 18) and were then imaged at multi-detector row CT. The anterior, central, and posterior vertebral body heights and wedge angles were measured in the midsagittal plane of the reformatted images. The amount of cement injected was determined by weighing the vertebrae before and after treatment. The statistical significance of changes in vertebral body height, wedge angle, and weight with the two treatment techniques was evaluated with the independent t test or Mann-Whitney U test.
Results: 
The increase in vertebral height was greater with kyphoplasty than with vertebroplasty (5.1 mm vs 2.3 mm, respectively; P < .05). The original vertebral height was restored in 93% of vertebrae with kyphoplasty and in 82% with vertebroplasty (P < .05). There was a greater decrease in wedge angle with kyphoplasty than with vertebroplasty (3.1 degrees vs 1.6 degrees, respectively); however, this difference was not significant (P > .05). There was no significant difference in the amount of cement injected with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty (P > .05).
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty increased vertebral body height more than vertebroplasty in this model of acutely created fractures in fresh cadaver specimens.},

Vertebroplasty is a relatively new procedure for the treatment of vertebral body fractures of different origin. Due to early promising results the rate of performed procedures increases constantly. Indeed an increasing number of partially severe complications are reported. A summary of the existing findings seems therefore necessary.
Methods: 
On the basis of a medline inquiry important aspects of vertebroplasty in the fields of basic science, diagnostics, indications, contraindications, technique, results and complications were compiled.
Results: 
Especially for the field of indications, possible longterm effects and for the "ideal" technique open questions exist, mainly due to missing prospective, randomized long-term clinical trials.
Conclusions: 
A final assessment of the significance of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures in comparison to conservative treatment is actually not possible. In contrast vertebroplasty is a therapeutical option for malignomas in selected cases.},

Since improvement of spinal biomechanics by restoration of vertebral morphology may affect the incidence of fracture, long-term clinical benefit and thereby cost-effectiveness, here we extend our previous work to assess occurrence of new vertebral fractures and clinical parameters 1 year after kyphoplasty compared with a conservatively treated control group. Sixty patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures due to primary osteoporosis were included: 40 patients were treated with kyphoplasty, 20 served as controls. All patients received standard medical treatment. Morphological characteristics, new vertebral fractures, pain (visual analog scale), physical function [European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) score] (range 0-100 each) and back-pain-related doctors' visits were re-assessed 12 months after kyphoplasty. There were significantly fewer patients with new vertebral fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine, after 12-months, in the kyphoplasty group than in the control group (P=0.0084). Pain scores improved from 26.2 to 44.4 in the kyphoplasty group and changed from 33.6 to 34.3 in the control group (P=0.008).

Kyphoplasty as an addition to medical treatment and when performed in appropriately selected patients by an interdisciplinary team persistently improves pain and reduces occurrence of new vertebral fractures and healthcare utilization for at least 12 months in individuals with primary osteoporosis.},

  abstract={Objective: 
During recent years, the benefits of balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have been frequently discussed for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Because of the lack of comparative studies, we performed an investigation to describe the mechanical effects and the impact on life quality during a follow-up period of 2 years.
Methods: 
Patients with nonrecent fractures of vertebral bodies, ongoing bone remodeling, and major kyphotic deformity were treated with minimal invasive stabilization. The median duration of pain was 8 weeks before surgery. Because of the availability of the equipment, 28 patients were nonrandomly assigned to balloon kyphoplasty and 23 patients to vertebroplasty. The follow-up was performed 2 years after surgery.
Results: 
The kyphotic wedge of the vertebral bodies was decreased 6 degrees by balloon kyphoplasty but not by vertebroplasty. With both methods, we found a rapid decrease of pain down to one-half of the preoperative value. A long-lasting effect on pain was found only after balloon kyphoplasty. In the kyphoplasty group, a decrease of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score was found during the first postoperative year. After 2 years, the ODI was not different from preoperative values in both groups.
Conclusions: 
In nonrecent fractures, the reduction of the kyphotic wedge by balloon kyphoplasty was superior in decreasing pain persisting over a period of 2 years. The ability to improve disability after kyphoplasty was limited to 1 year. In nonrecent fractures, the consequences of age and osteoporosis seem to equalize the effects of the restored sagittal profile on disability but not on pain.},

  abstract={This study was intended to measure the volume of intravertebral cement after balloon kyphoplasty with high resolution computed tomography (CT) and dedicated software. Volume changes of biocompatible calcium phosphate cement (CPC) were detected during a follow-up of 12 months. Measurements were compared with a control group of patients treated with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Twenty-three vertebrae (14 CPC, 9 PMMA) of 12 patients were examined with CT using an identical imaging protocol. Dedicated software was used to quantify intravertebral cement volume in subvoxel resolution by analyzing each cement implant with a density-weighted algorithm. The mean volume reduction of CPC was 0.08 ml after 12 months, which corresponds to an absorption rate of 2 vol%. However, the difference did not reach significance level (P>0.05). The mean error estimate was 0.005 ml, indicating excellent precision of the method. CT volumetry appears a precise tool for measurement of intravertebral cement volume. CT volumetry offers the possibility of in vivo measurement of CPC resorption.},

  abstract={Objective: 
A prospective randomized study was conducted to determine whether there exist any differences in radiographic, clinical, or functional outcomes when individuals with stable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction without neurologic deficit are treated with either a posterior fusion with instrumentation or anterior reconstruction, fusion, and instrumentation. There exists relatively little literature evaluating the outcomes of individuals treated with anterior surgery, and no prospective randomized studies exist comparing the two treatment approaches.
Methods: 
From May 1995 to March 2001, a consecutive series of subjects with acute isolated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) without neurologic deficit were randomized to receive either an anterior fusion with instrumentation or a posterior fusion with instrumentation. Radiographs including computed tomography (CT) were obtained. Radiographs were repeated at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months. The CT scan was also repeated at 24 months. Hospital stay, cost, operating time, blood loss, complications, and patient-related functional outcomes were measured.
Results: 
Of 43 enrolled, 38 completed a minimum of 2-year follow-up (average: 43 months; range: 24-108 months). Eighteen received a posterior spine fusion and 20 an anterior approach. Hospital stay and operating time were similar. Blood loss was higher in the group treated anteriorly; however, the incidence of transfusion was the same. There were 17 "complications" including instrumentation removal for pain in 18 patients treated posteriorly, but only 3 minor complications in 3 patients treated anteriorly. Patient-related functional outcomes were similar for the two groups.
Conclusions: 
Although patient outcomes are similar, anterior fusion and instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures may present fewer complications or additional surgeries.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Clinical trial (phase II).
Objectives: 
To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon vertebroplasty after posterior short-segment reduction and fixation for the treatment of traumatic burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Hardware failure and loss of reduction after posterior short-segment instrumentation are complications caused by insufficiency of anterior column support. This is due to migration of disc tissue through the endplate into the fractured vertebral body that cannot be restored with posterior instrumentation.
Methods: 
Patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were included. After posterior reduction and fixation, bilateral transpedicular balloon reduction of the endplate was performed, and calcium phosphate cement was injected. Preoperative and postoperative Cobb angle and central and anterior height were assessed with radiographs and MRI.
Results: 
Twenty patients underwent surgery without technical difficulties, and a substantial reduction of the endplates could be achieved with the technique. All patients recovered uneventfully, and the neurologic examination revealed no deficits. The postoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone defect without unwarranted bone displacement. The central and anterior height of the vertebral body could be restored to 78 and 91% of the estimated intact height, respectively. Complications were cement leakage in five cases without clinical implications and one wound hematoma.
Conclusions: 
Transpedicular balloon vertebroplasty for the direct restoration of burst fractures seems feasible in combination with posterior instrumentation. Cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences.},

  abstract={The application of autogenous bone grafts represents the golden standard for reconstruction of the load-bearing anterior column in the thoracolumbar spine. However, the osseous integration of the implanted grafts is demanding and delayed union or pseudarthrosis may occur. There are no standardized data available yet indicating the further course in such cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incorporation of endoscopically applied grafts and to develop therapeutic strategies for delayed or non-fusions. Twenty patients suffering from unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine were studied in a prospective clinical trial. After primary dorsal stabilization, the anterior column was thoracoscopically reconstructed with an autogenous iliac crest graft and a fixed-angle implant (MACS). The osseous integration of the bone grafts was detected by MSCT 1 year postoperatively. Complete integration of the transplanted bone grafts was observed in only 65% of the cases. In 25% partial integration was detected and in two cases a fracture of the transplanted iliac crest graft occurred. Despite the incomplete integration of the bone grafts, the further course without surgical intervention revealed no clinical or radiological evidence of a concomitant implant loosening or a relevant secondary loss of correction. Similar to the open technique, endoscopic reconstruction of the anterior column with autogenous bone grafts may lead to disadvantageous results concerning the integration and healing of the applied bone grafts. Decision making in such cases depends on the individual clinical and radiological findings (i.e., evidence of implant loosening and concomitant loss of correction).},

  abstract={Background: 
Minimally invasive augmentation techniques of vertebral bodies have been advocated to treat osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures (VBCFs). Kyphoplasty is designed to address both fracture-related pain as well as kyphotic deformity usually associated with fracture. Previous studies have indicated the potential of this technique for reduction of vertebral body height, but there has been little investigation into whether this has a lasting effect. The current study reports on our experience and the one-year results in 27 kyphoplasty procedures (24 patients) for osteoporotic VBCFs.
Results: 
All but one patient experienced pain relief following the procedure (on VAS 1-10)--with a lasting effect over the follow-up period in 25 cases. An average vertebral kyphosis reduction of 47.7% was achieved with no loss of reduction after one year. The potential for reduction was statistically related to the pre-operative amount of kyphosis, the level treated, and the age of the fracture, but not to the age of the patient. During follow-up, one fracture adjacent to a treated level was observed. Pain relief was not related to the amount of reduction.
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty is an effective treatment of VBCFs in terms of pain relief and durable reduction of deformity. Whether spinal realignment results in an improved long-term clinical outcome remains to be investigated.},

  abstract={Background context: 
With the aging of the population, painful osteoporotic compression fractures are becoming more common.
Purpose: 
To review the physiologic implications of these injuries as well as treatment options and outcomes, especially with reference to newer, percutaneous "augmentation" procedures, that is, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Study design::Setting: 
A literature review.
Methods: 
No direct, randomized studies comparing vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and standard, nonoperative care are available.
Results: 
The growing literature suggests a role for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the management of patients with intractable pain or progressive vertebral collapse after vertebral compression fracture. Both procedures likely offer similar rates of pain relief. Kyphoplasty, although more expensive, may allow fracture reduction. The void created with the balloon tamp allows a more viscous cement to be applied, thereby decreasing the risk of extravasation.
Conclusions: 
More study is required to understand the ideal role of these new techniques in the management of spinal osteoporosis and associated fractures. However, for carefully selected cases, current data suggest that the complication rates are low and pain relief can be profound.},

74 fractures were treated with a fixateur intern and a dorsal fusion by apposition of autologous bone postero-laterally. 23 fractures were fused in a combined dorso-ventral manner by intervertebral fusion with tricortical autologous bone. The lateral X-rays showed a loss of correction up to 48 % in the dorsal fused group and 10 % loss of correction in the combined group. The local kyphosis increased up to 84 % in the dorsal operated group due to degeneration of the injured disk. The clinical Oswestry score showed no significant difference in both groups.

These are related to underlying renal osteodystrophy, hypophosphatemia, and immunosuppressive treatment regimen. Although bisphosphonates are useful in ameliorating bone mineral loss after transplantation, it is not known whether their use in renal transplant patients leads to excessive suppression of bone turnover and increased incidence of adynamic bone disease. A randomized, prospective, controlled, clinical trial was conducted using the bisphosphonate pamidronate intravenously in patients with new renal transplants. Treatment subjects (PAM) received pamidronate with vitamin D and calcium at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3, and 6. Control (CON) subjects received vitamin D and calcium only. During months 6 to 12, the subjects were observed without pamidronate treatment. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover were obtained monthly and, bone mineral density (BMD) was obtained at baseline and months 6 and 12. Bone biopsies for mineralized bone histology were obtained at baseline and at 6 mo in a subgroup of subjects who underwent scheduled living donor transplantation. PAM preserved bone mass at 6 and 12 mo as measured by bone densitometry and histomorphometry. CON had decreased vertebral BMD at 6 and 12 mo (4.8 +/- 0.08 and 6.1 +/- 0.09%, respectively). Biochemical parameters of bone turnover were similar in both groups at 6 and 12 mo. Bone histology revealed low turnover bone disease in 50% of the patients at baseline. At 6 mo, all of PAM had adynamic bone disease, whereas 50% of CON continued to have or developed decreased bone turnover. Pamidronate preserved vertebral BMD during treatment and 6 mo after cessation of treatment. Pamidronate treatment was associated with development of adynamic bone histology. Whether an improved BMD with adynamic bone histology is useful in maintaining long-term bone health in renal transplant recipients requires further study.},

  abstract={Aim of the study: 
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are an ailment of the aging population of increasing incidence and high socioeconomic impact. Intractable pain causing significant morbidity leads to long-term hospitalisation. Kyphoplasty offers a new minimal invasive operative stabilisation procedure for these vertebral compression fractures. This study is conducted to investigate whether this procedure significantly reduces both pain and the duration of hospital stay in comparison to conservative treatment modalities.
Method: 
From January until July 2002 a total of 22 patients had undergone kyphoplasty in 37 vertebral bodies. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated in 18 cases, while in another 4 cases prophylactic stabilisation for osteolytic lesions was performed. Both the duration of hospital stay and the reduction of pain symptoms were determined and compared to a conservatively treated control group of 20 patients suffering from 35 fractured vertebral bodies. Pre- and postoperative endplate angles were measured to assess the restoration of the sagittal alignment. The effects on pain symptoms were measured on a self-reported Visual Analogue Score Scale.
Results: 
The mean pain relief for the patients undergoing kyphoplasty was 82 %, which was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the group of the conservatively treated patients (42 %). Reduction of the kyphotic deformity was achieved in 4 cases (average 8.5 degrees ). The average in-patient treatment duration for the surgical treated patients was 10 days as opposed to a significantly longer mean hospitalisation of 20 days (p = 0.003). Cement extravasation was observed in 5 out of 37 treated vertebral bodies without clinical sequelae.
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty is a safe minimal invasive procedure for the stabilisation of osteoporotic vertebral fractures leading to a statistically significant reduction both of pain status and duration of hospitalisation.},

  abstract={Background: 
To our knowledge, a prospective, randomized study comparing operative and nonoperative treatment of a thoracolumbar burst fracture in patients without a neurological deficit has never been performed. Our hypothesis was that operative treatment would lead to superior long-term clinical outcomes.
Methods: 
From 1994 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients (thirty-two men and fifteen women) with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative (posterior or anterior arthrodesis and instrumentation) or nonoperative treatment (application of a body cast or orthosis). Radiographs and computed tomography scans were analyzed for sagittal alignment and canal compromise. All patients completed a questionnaire to assess any disability they may have had before the injury, and they indicated the degree of pain at the time of presentation with use of a visual analog scale. The average duration of follow-up was forty-four months (minimum, twenty-four months). After treatment, patients indicated the degree of pain with use of the visual analog scale and they completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry back-pain questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey.
Results: 
In the operative group (twenty-four patients), the average fracture kyphosis was 10.1 degrees at the time of admission and 13 degrees at the final follow-up evaluation. The average canal compromise was 39% on admission, and it improved to 22% at the final follow-up examination. In the nonoperative group (twenty-three patients), the average kyphosis was 11.3 degrees at the time of admission and 13.8 degrees at the final follow-up examination after treatment. The average canal compromise was 34% at the time of admission and improved to 19% at the final follow-up examination. On the basis of the numbers available, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to return to work. The average pain scores at the time of the latest follow-up were similar for both groups. The preinjury scores were similar for both groups; however, at the time of the final follow-up, those who were treated nonoperatively reported less disability. Final scores on the SF-36 and Oswestry questionnaires were similar for the two groups, although certain trends favored those treated without surgery. Complications were more frequent in the operative group.
Conclusion: 
We found that operative treatment of patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and normal findings on the neurological examination provided no major long-term advantage compared with nonoperative treatment.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To describe the immediate outcome of a large cohort of patients who underwent percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty for treatment of one or more vertebral fractures.
Materials and methods: 
This retrospective cohort study included seven university-based and private hospitals in the United States. Of 488 consecutive patients (mean age, 76 years) who underwent percutaneous PMMA vertebroplasty between 1996 and 1999, 245 were successfully interviewed retrospectively after vertebroplasty (median time, 7 months). Through telephone interview, patients completed our self-developed questionnaire designed to measure pain (10-point scale), ambulation (five-point scale), and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) (five-point scale) before and after vertebroplasty. Differences in reported pain, ambulation, and ability to perform ADL before and after vertebroplasty were evaluated with paired t tests. Differences in proportions were compared with the McNemar test. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the consistency of differences in pre- and postprocedural pain and functional status by patient age, number of fractures, time from fracture to vertebroplasty, and time from vertebroplasty to questionnaire completion.
Results: 
On a 10-point scale, mean pain decreased from 8.9 before vertebroplasty to 3.4 afterward (P <.001). Seventy-two percent of patients had substantially impaired ambulation before vertebroplasty compared with 28% afterward (P <.001). Ability to perform ADL was also significantly improved following vertebroplasty (P <.001). Twelve patients (4.9%) experienced symptomatic complications (none major or life threatening).
Conclusion: 
Treatment of vertebral fractures with percutaneous PMMA vertebroplasty appears to be safe and results in substantial immediate pain reduction and improved functional status. A randomized controlled trial appears warranted to assess the efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective study of 12 patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures was conducted.
Objective: 
To assess the feasibility of ultrasound examination for posterior ligament complex injury in thoracolumbar spinal fractures.
Summary of background data: 
In posterior ligament complex injury of thoracolumbar spine fracture, the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis has been reported. Nevertheless the usefulness of ultrasound for diagnosis has not been studied, whereas diagnostic ultrasound has been applied in the musculoskeletal system.
Methods: 
Two healthy volunteers without a history of spinal trauma were recruited for pilot examination of the ultrasound procedure to access normal findings of the posterior ligament complex. This study investigated 12 thoracolumbar spine fractures. Four were flexion distraction injury; six were stable or unstable burst fractures; and two were simple compression fractures. Osteoporotic spine fractures were excluded from this study. Ultrasound was performed over the injured area by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist in addition to radiography and MRI. Five patients underwent operative procedures to stabilize the fractured spine. Imaging data and operative findings were correlated with ultrasound examination.
Results: 
In the patients who did not undergo surgery, agreement in diagnosis between MRI and ultrasound was moderate (5 of 7). Difficulty evaluating ligament status was encountered when the region of interest was the lower thoracic level (T10, T11, T12) because of long overlapping spinous processes. In the patients who underwent surgery, correlation between MRI, ultrasound, and operative findings was excellent, especially in diagnosing the status of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments. Nevertheless, it is impossible to visualize deep-seated structures (i.e., ligamentum flavum, deep muscles of the spine, and facet joint) with ultrasound.
Conclusions: 
This study demonstrated the excellent diagnostic ability of ultrasound to detect the status of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, especially in patients who undergo surgery. Although ultrasound examination appears to be less sensitive than MRI in predicting ligament status, the cost effectiveness of ultrasound and its use as an alternative to MRI in special situations (i.e., patients with pacemaker, ferromagnetic implant, or severe claustrophobia) should be emphasized. More clinical data concerning the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound examination should be addressed in future studies.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective trial.
Objectives: 
To test an intraoperative diagnostic tool to determine if it provided the surgeon with a safe, reproducible, accurate, quantitative measure of lumbar spine motion segment stability.
Summary of background data: 
Several devices have been developed to measure motion segment stiffness, however, few have been tested intraoperatively on humans, and none, to the best of the authors' knowledge have been tested as extensively as the device described in this study. Objective criteria, such as those provided by an intraoperative gauge, can be helpful in determining when and what type of fusion of a degenerated spinal motion segment unit should be performed following decompressive surgery.
Methods: 
The spinal stiffness gauge, placed between spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae, applies a controlled, constant loading rate along the spine's longitudinal axis, producing a load-displacement curve from which stiffness, range of motion, and hysteresis can be computed. Measurements from this tool were then used to investigate differences in stiffness of the motion segment before and after decompressive surgery, between spine levels, and between male and female subjects.
Results: 
The spinal stiffness gauge stiffness measurements correlated with the surgeon's subjective stiffness measurements on the same motion segments. The stiffness measurements had excellent repeatability. Stiffness was dependent on the spine level, gender, and degree of disc degeneration.
Conclusions: 
This study demonstrated the efficacy of the spinal stiffness gauge for providing an objective, quantitative, intraoperative stiffness (stability) measurement of the lumbar spine motion segment.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective cohort study.
Objectives: 
To study the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of thoracolumbar spine fractures concerning the radiologic and clinical outcome.
Summary of background data: 
Disagreement about the proper treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures is caused by insufficiency of conventional imaging techniques. Previous studies have shown that MRI is capable of distinguishing injury to all structures of the fractured spine and thus may help develop schemes with higher predictive power.
Methods: 
A total of 53 patients with 71 fractures were studied with MRI in a prospective fashion. A total of 24 patients with 39 fractures were treated conservatively and 29 patients with 32 fractures were treated operatively after a protocol concerning the treatment options. MRI scans were obtained within 1 week of injury and at the 2-year follow-up. Pain scores were obtained at the 2-year follow-up. Previously described MRI schemes concerning the trauma and post-trauma conditions were used.
Results and conclusions: 
An unfavorable outcome in the conservative group was related to the progression of kyphosis, which in most cases was predictable with the use of trauma MRI findings concerning the endplate comminution and vertebral body involvement. In the operatively treated group, recurrence of the kyphotic deformity was predictable by the lesion of the posterior longitudinal ligamentary complex together with endplate comminution and vertebral body involvement as seen on trauma MRI. The authors recommend the use of MRI to develop reliable prognostic criteria for these injuries.},

Concerning the clinical performance of the navigation system, the average time of matching has been 8.4 minutes per vertebrae. For evaluation of the results, only complete intraosseous placement of the pedicle screw has been defined as correct position. Any medial or lateral perforation of the cortical structure of the pedicle was recorded as malplacement. In the CT-controlled patients complete intrapedicular placement of the screw was obtained in 36 of 45 thoracic (80%) and in 22 of 27 navigated lumbar (81%) pedicles. In the conventional cohort group 27 of 34 (79%) thoracal and 43 of 52 (83%) lumbar screws were completely in. No radicular neurologic damage, caused by a malplaced transpedicular screw has been observed in both groups. In the presented study is shown, that the application of the computer-assisted freehand navigation can improve results concerning the precision of spinal screw placement. Although, the spinal navigator has to consider a learning curve for the clinical inauguration of the system and the qualification of the implant system for computer-assisted application.},

  abstract={The authors directly the compared biomechanical pullout strength of screws placed in the cervical lateral masses to that of screws placed across the facet joints. Posterior cervical fixation with lateral mass plates is an accepted adjunctive technique for cervical spine fusions. Altered anatomy resulting from congenital malformation, tumor, trauma, infection, or failed lateral mass fixation may limit traditional screw placement options. Transfacet screw placement, which has been studied extensively in the lumbar spine, may offer an alternative when posterior cervical fusion is required. Ten fresh human cadaveric cervical spines (postmortem age range, 69 to 91 years) were harvested. On one side, transfacet screws were placed at the C3-4, C5-6, and C7-T1 levels. On the other side, lateral mass screws were placed at the C3, C5, and C7 levels. The screw insertion technique at each level was randomized for right or left. After screw placement, each set of vertebral bodies were dissected and mounted in a custom jig for axial pullout testing using a servohydraulic testing machine. The load-displacement curves were obtained for each screw pullout. The mean pullout strength for the screws placed across the facets was 467 N (range, 192 to 1,176 N). This compares with 360 N (range, 194 to 750 N) for the lateral mass screws (p = 0.008). At each level, transfacet screws exhibited greater pullout resistance compared with the lateral mass placement, but the difference was most pronounced at the C7-T1 level (lateral mass = 373 N, transfacet = 539 N, p = 0.042). Cervical transfacet screw placement provides pullout resistance that is comparable to, if not greater than, lateral mass placement. This type of placement, although technically difficult, may be an alternative to lateral mass screws in cases with unusual anatomy, stripped screws, or when additional intermediate points of fixation are desired.},

Previous studies of surgical procedures have shown a significant rate of incorrect placement of the screw ranging from 10 to 40%. A new technique that combines preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging with intraoperative passive navigation was used to perform 64 pedicle screw insertions in the thoracolumbar region. At the same time, 64 pedicle screw insertions were performed manually in the same region and on the same vertebral levels. Surgery was followed in all cases by postoperative radiographs and computed tomography examination, which allowed measurements of screw position relative to pedicle position to be performed. A comparison between the two groups showed that six screws in 64 vertebra (9%) had incorrect placement with the computer-assisted technique whereas 28 screws in 64 vertebra (44%) had incorrect placement with manual insertion. The intraoperative accuracy provided by the computer after registration was better than 1 mm. The good results obtained are similar to those reported in the literature. The cortex penetration observed with the computer-assisted technique was not imputed to computer failure. Errors by the surgeon in acquiring data in the pre- and perioperative steps may explain the six incorrect screw placements. This clinical experience confirms that the accuracy and the reliability of this computer-assisted technique are good.},

This was a prospective, randomized study.
Objective: 
To compare the ability of three methods of internal fixation (Harrington rods, AO internal fixator, posterior segmental fixator) to obtain reduction of intracanal fragments in thoracolumbar vertebral compression burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Sixty-seven acute thoracolumbar compression burst fractures of T12 or L1 were randomized into three groups that were treated using one of the three methods. Reduction was accomplished indirectly by distraction applied using the fixation device.
Methods: 
The spinal canal encroachment was calculated as a percentage of the estimated pre-injury value from serial transverse computed tomographic scans obtained on admission and immediately after surgery.
Results: 
The median preoperative sagittal encroachment of the spinal canal was 37% (range, 0-90%) of the normal diameter. All three methods of internal fixation produced a spinal canal clearance provided that the patient was operated on within 4 days after trauma. The median postoperative encroachment varied from 13% (range, 0-37%) to 22% (range, 0-37%), the best reduction being attained using Harrington rods and the poorest with the posterior segmental fixator. There was a suggestive statistical significance between these two.
Conclusion: 
The differences in postoperative spinal canal encroachment and ability to obtain spinal canal clearance observed between the devices studied were small. There seems to be no reason to base the choice of the operative method in thoracolumbar fractures on any hypothetical differences in reductive power between Harrington rods and the AO internal fixator.},

Patients were alternately treated by posterior distraction using pedicle instrumentation (AO fixateur interne) or anterior decompression and instrumentation (Kostuik-Harrington device). Forty patients are presented with a mean follow-up of 20 months. Preoperatively, there was significant canal compromise in 39 patients. This measured 44.5% in those patients undergoing posterior surgery and 58% in those patients undergoing anterior surgery. Postoperatively, this was reduced to 16.5% and 4%, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference between these two groups (P less than 0.0001). The mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 18.7 degrees in those patients treated by anterior surgery and 18.2 degrees in the group treated by posterior surgery. At last follow-up, the mean improvement in kyphotic deformity was 9.3 degrees in the anterior group and 11.3 degrees in the posterior group. There is no statistically significant difference between these two groups. There were two implant failures of the anterior Kostuik-Harrington construct and two implant failures of the AO fixateur interne. Blood loss was significantly higher in the patients undergoing anterior surgery, but there were no complications from thoracotomy and anterior decompression of the dural sac. This study supports the hypothesis that posterior distraction instrumentation can effectively decompress the canal and correct kyphosis in patients sustaining burst-type injuries. Anterior surgery, however, results in a more complete and reliable decompression of the canal.},

  abstract={Background: 
The main aims of managing thoracolumbar fractures involve stabilization of traumatized regions, to promote vertebral healing or segmental fusion. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation has evolved as an alternative approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, aiming to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare outcomes of percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Relevant articles were identified from six electronic databases from their inception to December 2014.
Results: 
From 12 relevant studies identified, 279 patients undergoing percutaneous fixation were compared with 340 open fixation procedures. Operative duration was significantly shorter in the percutaneous group by 19 min (P = 0.0002). The percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter hospital stay by 5.7 days (P = 0.0007). Whilst there was no difference in screw malpositioning (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33, 1.83; P = 0.56), the percutaneous approach had lower rates of infections (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13, 1.00; P = 0.05), and superior visual analogue scale clinical outcomes (P = 0.001). No difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative Cobb angle (P = 0.22), postoperative body angle (P = 0.66), and postoperative anterior body height (P = 0.19).
Conclusions: 
The percutaneous approach was associated with shorter operative duration and hospital stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss and reduced infection rates. Given the lack of robust clinical evidence, these findings warrant verification in large prospective registries and randomized trials.},

  abstract={Background: 
Spine fractures are common. The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial but surgery involving pedicle screw fixation has become a popular option.
Objectives: 
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of pedicle screw fixation for traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 11), the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM Database) (1978 to March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (March 2011), reference lists of articles and conference proceedings.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing pedicle screw fixation and other methods of surgical treatment, or different methods of pedicle screw fixation, for treating traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Data collection and analysis: 
Three review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Limited meta-analysis was performed.
Main results: 
Pedicle screw fixation versus other methods of surgery that do not involve pedicle screw fixation was not looked at in any of the identified trials. Studies that were identified investigated different methods of pedicle fixation.Five randomised and three quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. All were at high or unclear risk of various biases, including selection, performance and detection bias. A total of 448 patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures were included in the review. Participants were restricted to individuals without neurological impairment in five trials. The mean ages of study populations of the eight trials ranged from 33 to 41 years, and participants had generally experienced traumatic injury. Mean follow-up for trial participants in the eight trials ranged from 28 to 72 months.Five comparisons were tested.Two trials compared short-segment instrumentation versus long-segment instrumentation. These studies found no significant differences between the two groups in self-reported function and quality of life at final follow-up. Aside from one participant, who sustained partial neurological deterioration that was resolved by further surgery (group not known), no neurological deterioration was noted in these trials.One trial comparing short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular bone grafting versus short-segment fixation alone found no significant difference between the two groups related to patient-perceived function and pain at final follow-up. All participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.Two trials compared posterior instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation ('including' group) versus posterior instrumentation alone ('bridging' group). Investigators reported no differences between the two groups in patient-reported function, quality of life, or pain at final follow-up. One trial confirmed that all participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.One trial comparing monosegmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation found no significant differences between the two groups in Oswestry Disability Index results or in pain scores at final follow-up. No neurological deterioration was reported.Three trials compared posterior instrumentation with fusion versus posterior instrumentation without fusion. Researchers found no differences between the two groups in function and quality of life or pain. No participants showed a decline in neurological status in any of the three trials, and no significant difference was reported between groups in the numbers whose status had improved at final follow-up. Two trials stated that patients in the fusion group frequently had donor site pain. Other reported complications included deep vein thrombosis and superficial infection.
Authors' conclusions: 
This review included only eight small trials and five different comparisons of methods of pedicle fixation in various participants while looking at a variety of outcomes at different time points. Overall, evidence is insufficient to inform the selection of different methods of pedicle screw fixation or the combined use of fusion. However, in the absence of robust evidence to support fusion, it is important to factor the risk of long-term donor site pain related to bone harvesting into the decision of whether to use this intervention. Further research involving high-quality randomised trials is needed.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Osteoporosis is a major health-care problem that is increasing in magnitude with the aging population. Such patients are more prone to develop painful and debilitating spinal deformities but are difficult to treat. Currently, no definitive treatment algorithm has been established.
Purpose: 
To review the failure modes of instrumentation and novel surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis with the goal of improving surgical care.
Study design::Setting: 
Review article.
Methods: 
We systematically searched PubMed for articles regarding instrumentation failure modes and surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis and summarized current treatment options.
Results: 
The surgical treatment options are severely limited because of the tendency for instrument failure secondary to pullout and subsidence, leading to revision procedures; multiple levels and multiple fixation points are recommended to minimize the risk. The literature supports the use of vertebroplasty in conjunction with pedicle screw-based instrumentation for treating more severe spinal deformities. Other techniques and modifications with evidence of reduced failure risk are bicortical screws, hydroxyapatite coatings, double screws, and expandable screws. Anterior approaches may provide another avenue of treatment, but only a few studies have been conducted on these implants in patients with osteoporosis.
Conclusions: 
Spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis are difficult to treat because of their debilitating and progressive nature. Novel surgical approaches and instruments have been designed to decrease construct failures in this patient population by reducing implant pullout, subsidence, and incidence of revision surgery. The success of these techniques depends on integrating biomaterial, biologic, and biomechanical aspects with clinical considerations. Synthesizing this myriad of aspects will lead to improved treatment options for patients with osteoporosis who are suffering from spinal deformities.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Case report.
Objective: 
To report bilateral pars fractures at L5 complicating a long fusion for adult idiopathic scoliosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
Summary of background data: 
To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature regarding bilateral pars fractures at the end instrumented vertebrae of a long fusion at the lumbosacral junction, nor reports that have evaluated long spinal deformity corrections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The question of ending a long fusion at L5 or S1 is controversial, and a review is presented.
Methods: 
We present the patient's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings; describe the surgical treatment and long-term follow-up; and provide a literature review.
Results: 
Bilateral pars fractures at the end instrumented vertebrae of a long construct (T4-L5) that we discovered were subsequently revised by extension of the fusion to the sacrum. Anterior structural support at L5-S1 was also provided. At the latest follow-up (46 months), the patient has had no recurrence of her symptoms. Her radiographs showed a stable construct without loss of alignment in the sagittal or coronal planes. Her rheumatoid arthritis continues to be treated with biologic, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
Conclusion: 
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the treatment and long-term outcome of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and bilateral pars fractures at the end instrumented vertebrae (L5) of a long deformity correction construct.},

  abstract={Aims: 
We performed a retrospective, comparative study of elderly patients with an increased risk from anaesthesia who had undergone either anterior screw fixation (ASF) or halo vest immobilisation (HVI) for a type II odontoid fracture.
Patients and methods: 
A total of 80 patients aged 65 years or more who had undergone either ASF or HVI for a type II odontoid fracture between 1988 and 2013 were reviewed. There were 47 women and 33 men with a mean age of 73 (65 to 96; standard deviation 7). All had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or more.
Results: 
Patients who underwent ASF had a significantly better outcome than those who were treated by HVI. There was a rate of nonunion of 10% after ASF and 23% after HVI. Failure of reduction or fixation occurred in 11 patients (15%) but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Mortality rates were also similar: 9% (n = 3) after ASF and 8% (n = 4) after HVI.
Conclusion: 
We conclude that ASF is the preferred method of treatment in this group of elderly patients, having a significantly higher rate of fusion, better clinical outcome and a similar rate of general and treatment-related complications. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:1222-6.},

  abstract={Methods: 
In this study of patients who underwent internal fixation without fusion for a burst thoracolumbar or lumbar fracture, we compared the serial changes in the injured disc height (DH), and the fractured vertebral body height (VBH) and kyphotic angle between patients in whom the implants were removed and those in whom they were not. Radiological parameters such as injured DH, fractured VBH and kyphotic angle were measured. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough low back outcome scale and a VAS scale for pain.
Results: 
Between June 1996 and May 2012, 69 patients were analysed retrospectively; 47 were included in the implant removal group and 22 in the implant retention group. After a mean follow-up of 66 months (48 to 107), eight patients (36.3%) in the implant retention group had screw breakage. There was no screw breakage in the implant removal group. All radiological and functional outcomes were similar between these two groups. Although solid union of the fractured vertebrae was achieved, the kyphotic angle and the anterior third of the injured DH changed significantly with time (p < 0.05).
Discussion: 
The radiological and functional outcomes of both implant removal and retention were similar. Although screw breakage may occur, the implants may not need to be removed.
Take home message: 
Implant removal may not be needed for patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine after fixation without fusion. However, information should be provided beforehand regarding the possibility of screw breakage.},

  abstract={Background: 
Since introduction of the pedicle screw-rod system, short-segment pedicle screw fixation has been widely adopted for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF). Recently, the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been introduced in spinal surgery; and it has become a popularly used method for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease. However, there are few clinical reports concerning the efficacy of PPSF without fusion in treatment of TLBF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of short-segment PPSF without fusion in comparison to open short-segment pedicle screw fixation with bony fusion in treatment of TLBF.
Methods: 
This study included 59 patients, who underwent either percutaneous (n = 32) or open (n = 27) short-segment pedicle screw fixation for stabilization of TLBF between December 2003 and October 2009. Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were assessed on a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph. For patient's pain and functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Frankel grading system, and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) were measured. Operation time, and the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss were also evaluated.
Findings: 
In both groups, regional kyphosis (Cobb angle) showed significant improvement immediately after surgery, which was maintained until the last follow up, compared with preoperative regional kyphosis. Postoperative correction loss showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. In the percutaneous surgery group, there were significant declines of intraoperative blood loss, and operation time compared with the open surgery group. Clinical results showed that the percutaneous surgery group had a lower VAS score and a better LBOS at three months and six months after surgery; however, the outcomes were similar in the last follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Both open and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation were safe and effective for treatment of TLBF. Although both groups showed favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes at the final follow-up, PPSF without bone graft provided earlier pain relief and functional improvement, compared with open TPSF with posterolateral bony fusion. Despite several shortcomings in this study, the result suggests that ongoing use of PPSF is recommended for the treatment of TLBF.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical results between computer assisted minimally invasive spine surgery (CAMISS) and traditional open fixation surgery which used in thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients who had undergone surgery for thoracolumbar fracture from January 2006 to March 2011 was performed. The patients were randomly divided into CAMISS group and traditional open treatment group (control group) by random number table. Clinical results were assessed by comparing the following parameters between patients who had undergone CAMISS or traditional open surgery: operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) of the low back pain, the accuracy of pedicle screw, the status and the correction of kyphosis.
Results: 
Forty-seven patients underwent CAMISS, and fifty patients underwent traditional open surgery. The follow-up periods were 3 - 50 months (mean 12 months). According to the preoperative data, the two groups did not differ with respect to age, gender, marriage, occupation, mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, preoperative VAS scores of the low back pain, preoperative functional spine unit (FSU) Cobb's angle and preoperative local angle of the fracture vertebral body (P > 0.05). Compare to the control group, the patients who got CAMISS had more accuracy of pedicle screw, less blood loss, short immobilized time, lower postoperative fever, and better VAS score of the low back pain (t = 2.162 - 8.736, P < 0.05). The improvement of FSU Cobb's angle and local angle of the fracture vertebral body were better at control group after operation (13.8° ± 6.8° vs. 10.9° ± 5.5°, 11.0° ± 6.0° vs. 7.7° ± 4.8°, t = 2.108 and 2.610, P < 0.05). But there was no significant difference of the FSU Cobb's angle, or local angle of the fracture vertebral body between the two groups at post-operation and follow-up (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: 
CAMISS has the characteristics of fewer traumas, less bleeding, faster recovery, high accuracy of pedicle screws. It has comparable vertebral deformity correction and fixation result of the traditional open operation.},

  abstract={The dorsal approach is increasingly preferred in the surgical treatment of vertebral fractures. However, the access and the implant's position cause muscle loss, which can lead to instability and a reduced capacity for rehabilitation. Morphological factors (bones, intervertebral discs) are typically blamed for chronic pain syndromes in the literature, while less importance is attached to functional factors (muscles). The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the isolated influence of dorsal spinal instrumentation on the back muscles by means of electromyography (EMG). A total of 32 patients with conditions after dorsal spondylodesis following the fracture of a vertebral body and 32 subjects with healthy backs were enrolled in this study. The EMG signal was recorded in three different muscle groups during isometric extension exercise. The evaluation was performed by comparing the mean rectified amplitudes of the three muscle groups in the patients and controls. The patients had significantly lower amplitudes in the multifidus muscle (MF) and significantly higher amplitudes in the iliocostal muscle (IL). Patients with severe pain were found to have lower electric muscle potentials in all investigated muscle groups than patients with mild pain. The muscle damage which was established in the multifidus muscle is compensated by increased activity in the iliocostal muscle. On the basis of anatomical considerations, the damage pattern can be identified as having been caused by surgery. It is extremely unlikely that trauma is the cause.},

  abstract={Vertebral compression fractures represent a frequent pathology among elderly population, with potentially devastating consequences. More than 20 years have passed since percutaneous vertebroplasty was initially used in the treatment of angiomas, representing nowadays a widely used treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The authors present a retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients (in total 94 fractured levels) that underwent polymethylmethacrylate percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to senile or secondary osteoporosis. All fractures were free from neurologic involvement and were classified as A1 type according to Magerl classification. All of patients were initially treated conservatively, by application of orthosis that allows immediate deambulation. At control, patients who complained of pain and limitation of daily activities underwent MRI. If presence of marrow signal changes, especially hypertense signal in T2-weighted images was confirmed, percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure was performed (we could call it "sub-acute" procedure). A limited group of patients that did not tolerate brace and had an insufficient pain control underwent vertebroplasty "in acute", few days after fracture. Immediate post-operative pain reduction and follow-up clinical outcome (estimating quality of life and residual back pain) were evaluated by means of Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index. In the immediate post-operative course a significant pain relief was found in 39 patients (66.1%), moderate pain relief in 17 (28.8%), while 3 (5.1%) did not achieve relevant pain improvement. Pain intensity and life quality was maintained within satisfactory limits after a mean follow-up of 16 months. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective and safe procedure for treating vertebral compression fractures in the elderly. It provides immediate pain relief and allows early mobilization, thus avoiding potentially severe complications related to persistent back pain and prolonged bed rest. When performed by experienced surgeon complication rate is low, representing a safe procedure, able to provide a satisfactory outcome.},

  abstract={Background: 
Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a widely adopted minimally invasive treatment for vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), but leakage of cement is a main complication of BKP. A novel vertebral augmentation technique radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK) with high viscosity cement was developed in 2009. Here, we aim to evaluate whether RFK can relieve symptoms efficiently and reduce cement leakage.
Methods: 
A literature search was performed using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL until September 30, 2016. Both randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non-RCT studies comparing RFK and BKP were included. The main outcomes included pain relief (VAS), functionality improvement (ODI), operation time, reduction of deformity (vertebral height and kyphosis angle), and incidence of cement leakage. The origin of heterogeneity was further explored by subgroup stratification.
Results: 
A total of 6 studies involving 833 patients with VCFs were included. The reduction of VAS score in the RFK group was 3.96 points more than that in the BKP group (P  =  .0007) postoperatively, and the improvement persisted until 12 months after the surgery (P < .00001). The operation time was shorter in RFK group than that in BKP group (P  =  .01). The increase of anterior vertebral height shortly after the operation was 0.53 mm greater in RFK group (P  =  .01). The decrease of kyphotic angle after RFK was 0.63° and 0.92° greater than that after BKP, both immediately and 6 months after operation (P  =  .002 and P < .00001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the incidence of cement leakage after RFK and BKP (P  =  .06). Further subgroup analysis stratified by study design indicated that the incidence of leakage decreased 15% in RFK than BPK (P < .00001) in non-RCT subgroup, but RFK and BKP treatments were equivalent in the RCT studies (P  =  .86).
Conclusion: 
RFK appears to be more effective and safer than BKP in the present meta-analysis. The incidence of cement leakage diverges in RCT and non-RCT studies, so large-sample multicentered RCT studies are required to validate this new surgery system.},

  abstract={Background: 
Use of a pedicle screw at the level of fracture, also known as an intermediate screw, has been shown to improve clinical results in managing thoracolumbar(TL) fractures, but there is a paucity of powerful evidence to support the claim. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level and conventional pedicle screw fixation (one level above and one level below the fracture level) for thoracolumbar (TL) fractures.
Methods: 
A meta-analysis of cohort studies was conducted between pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level (combined screw group) and conventional pedicle screw fixation (conventional group) for the treatment of TL fractures from their inception to December 2015. An extensive search of studies was performed in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library. The following outcome measures were extracted: visual analogue scale (VAS), operation time and intraoperative blood loss, Cobb angle and anterior vertebral height (AVH), and complications. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3.5.
Results: 
From 10 relevant studies identified, 283 patients undergoing pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level were compared with 285 conventional pedicle screw procedures. The pooled analysis showed that there was statistically significant difference in terms of postoperative Cobb angle (95% confidence interval (CI), -3.00, -0.75; P = 0.001) and AVH (95% CI, 0.04, 12.23; P = 0.05), correction loss (Cobb angle: P < 0.0001; AVH: P < 0.0001) and implant failure rate (95% CI, 0.06, 0.62; P = 0.006), and blood loss (W 95% CI, 2.22, 23.60; P = 0.02) between 2 groups. But in terms of other complications, there were no differences between 2 groups (95% CI, 0.23, 2.04; P = 0.50). No difference was found in operation time (95% CI, -5.36, 14.67; P = 0.36) and VAS scores (95% CI, -0.44, 0.01; P = 0.06).
Conclusions: 
The combined screw fixation technique was associated with better reduction of the fractured vertebrae, less correction loss in the follow-up, and lower implant failure rate. Given the lack of robust clinical evidence, these findings warrant verification in large prospective registries and randomized trials with long-term follow-up.},

  abstract={Background: 
Patients with intractable cancer pain often require non-pharmacological analgesic treatment that is accompanied by procedure-related pain. Previous works have shown that propofol infusion in adjunction to regional anesthesia provides appropriate sedation during such painful procedures. However, there are a few reports of its use to reduce procedure-related pain in terminal cancer patients. We report cases of propofol sedation during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with metastatic vertebral compression fracture.
Methods: 
Propofol was infused during PVP in eleven cancer patients after obtaining written informed consent. The infusion rate of propofol was adjusted using a target-controlled infusion pump to achieve appropriate sedation levels under monitoring bispectral index of the electroencepharogram. Hepatic and renal functions were evaluated using common serum markers, which were determined using standard hospital laboratory methods.
Results: 
The duration of the procedure was 65.5 +/- 5.5 (mean +/- SD) min. The required infusion rate was 8.66 +/- 1.50 mg.kg-1.hr-1. The interval from the termination of the infusion until emergence was 10.7 +/- 4.2 min. No life-threatening complications or significant changes in liver and renal functions were observed.
Conclusions: 
Propofol can be used effectively and safely for sedation during PVP in terminal cancer patients.},

Painful vertebral compression fractures.
Standard treatment: 
Analgesia.
Treatment innovations: 
Osteoplastic procedures, such as kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
Diagnostic workup: 
Anamnestic and radiological associations of clinical complaints with the radiomorphological findings of vertebral compression fractures are required for an adequate consideration to assess whether an osteoplastic procedure should be carried out. A computed tomography (CT) scan allows a reliable judgement whether an osteoplastic procedure is technically feasible and promising to improve the local vertebral fracture-associated pain.
Performance: 
Prospective controlled trials have demonstrated a satisfactory improvement of back pain associated with vertebral fractures and parameters of quality of life by osteoplastic interventions.
Achievements: 
No prospective, truly sham-controlled blind trials are currently available which demonstrate an advantage of osteoplastic interventions compared to standard pain treatment; however, the currently published prospective controlled trials show a satisfactory pain reduction by osteoplastic interventions, such as kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
Practical recommendations: 
Painful vertebral fractures and progressive loss of vertebral height of compression fractures should be evaluated in an interdisciplinary team consisting of radiologists, spinal surgeons and internists to assess whether an osteoplastic procedure is technically feasible and promising to improve local pain and immobility associated with vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort.
Objective: 
To compare survivorship after cement augmentation of refractory osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with traditional inpatient pain management and bracing.
Summary of background data: 
OVCFs can cause debilitating pain and functional decline necessitating prolonged bed rest and high-dose narcotics. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are cement augmentation procedures used to control pain and restore function in patients with OVCF's that are refractory to conservative treatment. Early mobilization is associated with improved survival after other fractures in elderly patients.
Methods: 
A university hospital database was used to identify all participants treated with primary diagnosis of OVCF between 1993 and 2006. Chart review and imaging studies were used to confirm demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, and treatment. Survival time was determined using hospital data, national death indices and patient follow-up. Exact Fisher tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and proportional hazards regression models with Kaplan-Meier plots compared patients treated with cement augmentation with controls treated with inpatient pain management and bracing. Patients with high-energy trauma, tumors or age more than 60 years were excluded.
Results: 
Within the past 12 years, 46 patients treated with cement augmentation and 129 matched controls met inclusion criteria. They did not differ with respect to age, sex, and comorbidities. A significant survival advantage was found after cement augmentation compared with controls (P < 0.001; log rank), regardless of comorbidities, age, or the number of fractures diagnosed at the start date (P = 0.565). Controlling simultaneously for covariates, the estimated hazard ratio associated with cementation was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.43; P = 0.002) for year 1, 0.15 (95% CI = 0.02-1.12; P = 0.064) for year 2, and 0.95 (95% CI = 0.32-2.79; P = 0.919) for subsequent follow-up. The number of OVCFs at the start time of treatment did not affect survival benefit of cementation (P = 0.44).
Conclusion: 
Cement augmentation of refractory OVCF improves survival for up to 2 years when compared with conservative pain management with bed rest, narcotics, and extension bracing, regardless of age, sex, and number of fractures or comorbidities. Therefore, aggressive management should be considered for refractory OVCFs with intractable back pain.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Spine trauma is relatively common, and each year approximately 10,000 to 17,000 people in the United States will sustain a spinal cord injury and approximately 150,000 to 160,000 will fracture their spinal column. Posttraumatic spinal deformity is a common potential complication of spinal injury and poses one of the greatest challenges in spinal surgery.
Purpose: 
To provide a comprehensive and current review of posttraumatic deformity focusing on the epidemiology, clinical and radiographical presentation, treatment options, and prognosis.
Study design::Setting: 
A thorough review of the English literature on the management of posttraumatic deformity was performed. Pertinent articles were identified by using PubMed and a review of publications by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.
Methods: 
Each article was reviewed, and findings were analyzed to formulate a concise review of current treatment methods for posttraumatic deformity.
Results: 
Successful treatment of posttraumatic deformity is dependent on careful patient selection and appropriate surgical intervention, which should be considered in the presence of significant or increasing deformity, increasing back and/or leg pain, "breakdown" at levels above or below the deformity, pseudarthrosis or malunion, and increasing neurological deficit. The goals of surgery should be to decompress the neural elements if neurological claudication or a neurological deficit is present, to recreate normal sagittal contours and balance, and to optimize the chances for successful fusion; these goals can be achieved through an all-anterior, all-posterior, or a combined anterior/posterior approach assuming that close attention is paid to using the appropriate bone-grafting techniques, selecting technically sound segmental instrumentation, and providing appropriate biomechanical environment for maintenance of correction and successful fusion.
Conclusions: 
Posttraumatic spinal deformity is a common complication of spinal injury, and it is therefore essential for patients with vertebral column injuries to have a careful initial evaluation, close follow-up, and early intervention when needed. Once posttraumatic deformity is present, successful outcome is achievable assuming a thorough, systematic, and technically well-executed surgical intervention is performed.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral compression fractures are a common complication of osteoporosis and are often treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). The ability of this procedure to relieve pain better than conservative treatment is still debated. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree and duration of pain relief following PVP with that following conservative treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures by means of meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Methods: 
The CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science databases were queried for randomized controlled trials comparing PVP with conservative treatment or placebo/sham. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework. Random-effects meta-analysis of the raw mean difference between groups in change in pain level was performed, with sensitivity analyses and the Egger test for potential publication bias.
Results: 
Of 209 records found, 11 were considered relevant, involving 1,048 participants. The risk of bias was considered low in 10 studies and high in 1. The 531 patients treated with PVP had a significantly lower pain level compared with the control group at 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 3 months, and 12 months. The 95% CI (confidence interval) of the pooled effect size at every time interval included the score of 1.5, considered to be the minimal clinically important difference. The largest pooled effect size of -1.4 (95% CI, -2.3 to -0.5) was found during the first 1 to 2 weeks. The heterogeneity was high at all 3 time points (I(2), 71% to 96%). No significant publication bias was detected.
Conclusions: 
Up to 1 year postoperatively, the effect of PVP exceeded the effect of conservative therapy with respect to pain relief in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures. The effect size was significant and close to the minimal clinically important difference.},

  abstract={Background: 
An osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is a common condition in elderly people, especially women. The percutaneous kyphoplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Controversy remains regarding whether a unilateral or a bilateral approach is superior, and to our knowledge, there have been no large studies comparing these two approaches, therefore a meta-analysis synthesizing the data on this question is warranted.
Questions::Purposes: 
We asked the following questions: (1) Is there evidence to suggest a benefit in clinical outcome as assessed by the VAS and Oswestry Disability Index of a unilateral kyphoplasty or bilateral kyphoplasties? (2) Are the complications associated with the two approaches different? (3) Do the procedures result in different kyphosis angle reduction or anterior vertebral height restoration? (4) Is the surgical time for the procedures different?
Methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge MEDLINE (January 1980 to June 2013), and reference lists of eligible prospective studies. The levels of the evidence and recommendations were assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. Five studies encompassing 253 patients met the inclusion criteria.
Results: 
The short- and long-term clinical outcomes as assessed by the VAS and Oswestry Disability Index showed no differences between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasties (p = 0.41, p = 0.60 for VAS; p = 0.10, p = 0.36 for Oswestry Disability Index). There were no differences in complications such as cement leakage and adjacent vertebral fractures associated with the two approaches (p = 0.43 and p = 0.95). The kyphosis angle reduction and anterior vertebral height restoration showed no difference between the two approaches (p = 0.34 and p = 0.46). The unilateral approach was shorter in terms of surgical time (mean difference, -24.98; p < 0.0001). The overall GRADE system evidence quality was very low, with only high evidence for operation time, which lessens our confidence in recommendations.
Conclusions: 
Unilateral and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasties appear to be safe and effective for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. No clinically important differences were found between them. Considering less operation time and less cost, we suggest that a unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty is advantageous, but because of the poor quality of the evidence, high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to resolve this issue.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Surgical treatment for odontoid fractures is widely performed in practice. However, the choice of different surgical procedures remains controversial. Regardless of the surgical technique, the fusion situation is one of the important factors that affect the clinical efficacy. A discrepancy in fusion rate between the anterior odontoid screw fixation approach and the posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis approach has been suggested in clinical research, yet no consensus has been reached. This meta-analysis aims to synthesize the currently available evidence on the topic.
Methods: 
Most published comparative studies have limited statistical power to reach a solid conclusion due to the sample size constraint. In this condensed meta-analysis, we focused on the analysis of the reported fusion rates among selected comparative studies. The targeted comparative study design was chosen to control for potential confounding factors. However, the inclusion criteria of comparative studies limited our sample size and we were not able to obtain statistically meaningful sample size for other endpoints. On the other hand, fusion rate serves as an important clinical outcome and is the most commonly reported one from odontoid fracture studies.
Results: 
Results show that the overall fusion rate is lower in anterior group than in posterior group in both fixed effect model (RR = 0.90, 95 % CI 0.82-0.99) and random effect model (RR = 0.90, 95 % CI 0.83-0.97). There was no significant heterogeneity between these studies (p value = 0.5718), and no evident publication bias was detected by the Egger's test (t = -0.3541, df = 6, p value = 0.7354) and funnel plots. In general, age is not statistically associated with the choice of surgical approach (χ(2) = 0.29, df = 1, p value = 0.59) but appears to affect the clinical efficacy. The protective effect of posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis treatment on fusion remains significant in the elderly (≥60 years), but loses its significance in the younger age population (<60 years).
Conclusions: 
In light of these findings, we concluded that significant higher fusion rates were observed in patients who underwent posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis surgeries compared to those treated with anterior odontoid screw fixation.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The study aims to evaluate the safety of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in Europe.
Methods: 
Systematic review of the literature, until September 2013, and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials performed in Europe assessing the safety of balloon kyphoplasty in patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Outcomes sought include cement leaks, serious clinical complications and new vertebral fractures.
Results: 
Six randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies included data on 525 treated levels in 424 patients. Cement leakages were detected in 18.3 % (95 % CI 11.6, 23.0) of fractures intervened. In about 0.5 % (95 % CI 0.1, 1.1) of fractures leakages proved to be symptomatic. Serious clinical complications were recorded in 11.5 % (95 % CI 1.1, 21.7) of patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty with several of these cases requiring intensive treatment or postoperative surgery. New vertebral fractures were detected in 20.7 % (95 % CI 0.4, 40.9) of patients treated but rates showed an upward pattern when the follow-up period increased. In 54 % of such cases, the fractures were located in regions adjacent to the treated level.
Conclusions: 
The safety profile and associated complications of balloon kyphoplasty shown in this analysis, based on the evidence provided by existing randomized controlled trials, can be of help to the practicing clinician who must contrast them with the potential benefits of the technique. These data represent an important step towards a balanced evaluation of the intervention though, a better reporting and more reliable data on long-term assessment of potential sequelae are needed.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The goal of this article is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) versus percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in dealing with the osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
Methods: 
In July 2014, a comprehensive systematic computer-based online search was performed by using the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wan Fang, and the China Biological Medicine. Only prospective comparative trials (PCT) and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared PVP with PKP were included. Trials were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously formed. The Cochrane collaboration guidelines were also used to assess the quality of these included studies. The primary data of these studies [volume of the cement, postoperative vertebral height, visual analog scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score after the surgery, and so on] were carefully abstracted and processed by Revman 5.2.0 software The publication bias of the main results (cement leakage and adjacent-level fracture) were examined by Stata 12.0 (Begg and Egger test). Furthermore, the stability of the main results were also detected by sensitivity and cumulative analyses.
Results: 
Six RCT and 14 PCT studies involving 1,429 patients met our criteria and were included finally. Comparing these two methods, the PKP group took more operation time [SMD = 0.66, 95 % CI (0.28, 1.03), p = 0.0006] with higher anterior vertebral body height [SMD = 1.40, 95 % CI (0.49, 2.32), p = 0.003], greatly reduced Cobb angle in the long run [SMD = -0.61, 95 % CI (-1.04, -0.19), p = 0.005] and had lower risk of cement leakage. However, in VAS scores and ODI scores after the surgery whether for the short-term efficacy (no more than 1 week after the surgery) or long-term efficacy (more than six months), Cobb angle in the short run and new fracture in the adjacent level, no statistically differences were found between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
Based on current evidence, PVP takes less time in the operation, while it has greater risk of cement leakage, was inferior in reducing Cobb angle in the long term and results in lower anterior vertebral body height after the surgery. For pain relief, which is the main desire of the patients, both procedures provide significant improvement in VAS and ODI pain scores. PVP is still an effective procedure.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To identify whether formal sacral decompression provides improvement in outcome for patients with neurologic deficit after sacral fracture compared with patients treated with indirect decompression and whether the timing of surgical decompression influences neurologic outcome?
Data sources: 
MEDLINE was searched via PubMed using combinations of the following search terms: "Sacral fracture," "Traumatic Sacral fracture," "Sacral fracture decompression," "Sacral fracture time to decompression," "Sacral Decompression." Only clinical studies on human subjects and in the English language were included.
Study selection: 
Studies that did not provide sufficient detail to confirm the nature of the sacral injury, treatment rendered, and neurologic outcome were excluded. Studies using subjects less than 18 years of age, cadavers, nonhuman subjects, or laboratory simulations were excluded. All other relevant studies were reviewed in detail.
Data extraction: 
All studies were assigned a level of evidence using the grading tool described by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and all studies were analyzed for bias. Both cohorts in articles comparing 2 groups of patients treated differently were included in the appropriate group. Early decompression was defined as before 72 hours.
Data synthesis: 
The effect of decompression technique and timing of decompression surgery on partial and complete neurologic recovery was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model to implement a logistic regression with a study-level random effect.
Conclusions: 
There was no benefit to early decompression within 72 hours and no difference between formal laminectomy and indirect decompression with respect to neurologic recovery.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE A multicenter, prospective, randomized equivalence trial comparing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) to no orthosis (NO) in the treatment of acute AO Type A3 thoracolumbar burst fractures was recently conducted and demonstrated that the two treatments following an otherwise similar management protocol are equivalent at 3 months postinjury. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there was a difference in long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes between the patients treated with and those treated without a TLSO. Here, the authors present the 5- to 10-year outcomes (mean follow-up 7.9 ± 1.1 years) of the patients at a single site from the original multicenter trial. METHODS Between July 2002 and January 2009, a total of 96 subjects were enrolled in the primary trial and randomized to two groups: TLSO or NO. Subjects were enrolled if they had an AO Type A3 burst fracture between T-10 and L-3 within the previous 72 hours, kyphotic deformity < 35°, no neurological deficit, and an age of 16-60 years old. The present study represents a subset of those patients: 16 in the TLSO group and 20 in the NO group. The primary outcome measure was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at the last 5- to 10-year follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included kyphosis, satisfaction, the Numeric Rating Scale for back pain, and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental and Physical Component Summary (MCS and PCS) scores. In the original study, outcome measures were administered at admission and 2 and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after injury; in the present extended follow-up study, the outcome measures were administered 5-10 years postinjury. Treatment comparison between patients in the TLSO group and those in the NO group was performed at the latest available follow-up, and the time-weighted average treatment effect was determined using a mixed-effects model of longitudinal regression for repeated measures averaged over all time periods. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and were replaced with a set of plausible values derived using a multiple imputation procedure. RESULTS The RMDQ score at 5-10 years postinjury was 3.6 ± 0.9 (mean ± SE) for the TLSO group and 4.8 ± 1.5 for the NO group (p = 0.486, 95% CI -2.3 to 4.8). Average kyphosis was 18.3° ± 2.2° for the TLSO group and 18.6° ± 3.8° for the NO group (p = 0.934, 95% CI -7.8 to 8.5). No differences were found between the NO and TLSO groups with time-weighted average treatment effects for RMDQ 1.9 (95% CI -1.5 to 5.2), for PCS -2.5 (95% CI -7.9 to 3.0), for MCS -1.2 (95% CI -6.7 to 4.2) and for average pain 0.9 (95% CI -0.5 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS Compared with patients treated with a TLSO, patients treated using early mobilization without orthosis maintain similar pain relief and improvement in function for 5-10 years.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Several trials have compared vertebral augmentation with nonsurgical treatment for vertebral compression fractures. This trial compares the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
Materials and methods: 
Patients with osteoporosis with 1-3 acute fractures (T5-L5) were randomized and treated with kyphoplasty (n = 191) or vertebroplasty (n = 190) and were not blinded to the treatment assignment. Twelve- and 24-month subsequent radiographic fracture incidence was the primary end point. Due to low enrollment and early withdrawals, the study was terminated with 404/1234 (32.7%) patients enrolled.
Results: 
The average age of patients was 75.6 years (77.4% female). Mean procedure duration was longer for kyphoplasty (40.0 versus 31.8 minutes, P < .001). At 12 months, 7.8% fewer patients with kyphoplasty (50/140 versus 57/131) had subsequent radiographic fracture, and there were 8.6% fewer at 24 months (54/110 versus 64/111). The results were not statistically significant (P > .21). When we used time to event for new clinical fractures, kyphoplasty approached statistical significance in longer fracture-free survival (Wilcoxon, P = .0596). Similar pain and function improvements were observed. CT demonstrated lower cement extravasation for kyphoplasty (157/214 versus 164/201 levels treated, P = .047). For kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty, common adverse events within 30 postoperative days were procedural pain (12/191, 9/190), back pain (14/191, 28/190), and new vertebral fractures (9/191, 17/190); similar 2-year occurrence of device-related cement embolism (1/191, 1/190), procedural pain (3/191, 3/190), back pain (2/191, 3/190), and new vertebral fracture (2/191, 2/190) was observed.
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty had similar long-term improvement in pain and disability with similar safety profiles and few device-related complications. Procedure duration was shorter with vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty had fewer cement leakages and a trend toward longer fracture-free survival.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
To prospectively evaluate the potential radiological and clinical effect of the additional application of an anterior plate in anteroposteriorly stabilized thoracolumbar fractures.
Patients and methods: 
75 consecutive patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures underwent posterior (internal fixator) and anterior stabilization (corpectomy cage with local autologous bone grafting). 40 (53.3%) patients received an additional anterior plate (Group A), while 35 (46.6%) (Group B) did not. Plain X-rays and CT-scans were obtained pre- and postoperatively, after 12 months and at the last follow-up (mean 32 months, range 22-72). Loss of reduction, cage subsidence to adjacent vertebrae, fusion rates and clinical results were evaluated.
Results: 
66 (87%) patients (36 Group A; 30 Group B) were available for follow-up. Patients in both groups were comparable regarding age, gender, comorbidities, localization and classification of fracture. Average loss of reduction was 2.4° in Group A, and 3.1° in Group B (not significant). Cage subsidence did not differ significantly between both groups, too. However, after 12 months the rate of continuous osseous bridging between endplates was significantly higher in Group A (63% vs. 25%) (p<0.05). After 32 months this difference was even higher (81% vs. 33%) (p<0.001). The bony fusion mass was located beneath or around the anterior plate in 94% of patients. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome.
Conclusions: 
Additional anterior plating in anteroposteriorly stabilized thoracolumbar fractures leads to significant faster fusion but does neither influence reduction loss nor cage subsidence. The anterior plate serves as a pathway for bone growth and increases biomechanical stability, resulting in a higher fusion rate.},

  abstract={The impact of parathyroidectomy (PTX) on the long-term risks for hip and other fractures is unknown. Uncontrolled case series have reported an increase in bone mineral density after PTX. However, very low serum parathyroid hormone levels have been associated with decreased bone mineral density, adynamic bone disease, and fractures. This study compared long-term fracture rates among hemodialysis patients who underwent PTX with a matched control group. Data were obtained from the US Renal Data System. Patients who underwent a first PTX while receiving hemodialysis were matched with up to three control patients by age, race, gender, year of dialysis initiation, primary cause of renal failure, and the dosage of intravenous vitamin D used before PTX. Patients with a history of fracture or renal transplantation were excluded. Study outcomes were incident hip, vertebral, and distal radius-wrist fractures identified using hospitalization codes. Incident hip fracture rates in the PTX and matched control groups were 6.0 and 9.3 fractures per 1000 person-years, respectively. After adjustment, PTX was associated with a significant 32% lower risk for hip fracture (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.86; P = 0.001) and a 31% lower risk for any analyzed fracture (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.83; P < 0.001) compared with matched control subjects. Fracture risks were lower among hemodialysis patients who underwent PTX compared with matched control subjects. Surgical amelioration of secondary hyperparathyroidism may outweigh the risk of parathyroid hormone oversuppression in terms of bone health.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The goal of the current study is to establish a surgical algorithm to accompany the AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system.
Methods: 
A survey was sent to AOSpine members from the six AO regions of the world, and surgeons were asked if a patient should undergo an initial trial of conservative management or if surgical management was warranted. The survey consisted of controversial injury patterns. Using the results of the survey, a surgical algorithm was developed.
Results: 
The AOSpine Trauma Knowledge forum defined that the injuries in which less than 30% of surgeons would recommend surgical intervention should undergo a trial of non-operative care, and injuries in which 70% of surgeons would recommend surgery should undergo surgical intervention. Using these thresholds, it was determined that injuries with a thoracolumbar AOSpine injury score (TL AOSIS) of three or less should undergo a trial of conservative treatment, and injuries with a TL AOSIS of more than five should undergo surgical intervention. Operative or non-operative treatment is acceptable for injuries with a TL AOSIS of four or five.
Conclusion: 
The current algorithm uses a meaningful injury classification and worldwide surgeon input to determine the initial treatment recommendation for thoracolumbar injuries. This allows for a globally accepted surgical algorithm for the treatment of thoracolumbar trauma.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Fractures, a common complication of cardiac and liver transplantation, have not been reported in association with lung transplantation. However, many patients with end-stage pulmonary disease have multiple risk factors for osteoporosis, and several studies have suggested that osteoporosis before transplantation may increase the risk of fracture after transplantation. Therefore, we evaluated a group of patients with end-stage pulmonary disease who were awaiting lung transplantation to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis.
Methods: 
Seventy patients (aged 18-70 years) were evaluated consecutively with bone densitometry by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The patients were predominantly Caucasian (96%). Bone mass was expressed as bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2), as the number of standard deviations (SD) below peak bone mass (T score), and as bone mineral apparent density (BMAD; g/cm3), a measurement that minimizes the effects of bone size on BMD. Spine radiographs were obtained in a subset of 50 consecutive patients to detect vertebral compression fractures. Vitamin D status was assessed with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The patients were sorted into groups by pulmonary diagnosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 28); cystic fibrosis (n = 11); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; and other lung diseases (Other; n = 31).
Results: 
In the group as a whole, osteoporosis (T score below -2.5) was present in 30% of the patients at the lumbar spine and 49% at the femoral neck. Osteopenia (T score between -1 and -2.5) was present in an additional 35% at the lumbar spine and 31% at the femoral neck. The average femoral neck T score of patients with COPD and cystic fibrosis fell into the osteoporotic range (-2.7 +/- 0.3 and -2.6 +/- 0.3, respectively), significantly (P < 0.01) below that of the patients in the Other category (-1.5 +/- 0.3). The average lumbar spine T score fell into the osteopenic range in all three groups. Low BMAD in patients with cystic fibrosis confirmed that their low BMD was not due to their smaller body size. The prevalence rate of vertebral fractures was 29% in patients with COPD and 25% in those with cystic fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < or = 10 ng/ml) was present in 36% of patients with cystic fibrosis and 20% with COPD and Other lung diseases. Lumbar spine BMD tended to be lower in cystic fibrosis patients with vitamin D deficiency. Patients with exposure to glucocorticoids (n = 46) had significantly more vertebral fractures (P < 0.05) and duration of exposure correlated negatively with lumbar spine BMD (r = -0.398; P = 0.008). COPD and Other patients not on glucocorticoids had mild lumbar spine osteopenia (0.972 +/- 0.06 g/cm2; T = -1.2 +/- 0.6). Very few of the patients on glucocorticoids were on any regimen to prevent osteoporosis.
Conclusions: 
Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency are extremely common in patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Only 34% of patients had normal lumbar spine BMD and only 22% had normal BMD at the hip. Patients with cystic fibrosis and glucocorticoid-treated patients with COPD were most severely affected. Therapies to prevent bone loss and treat established osteoporosis are uncommonly utilized in glucocorticoid-treated patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Candidates for lung transplantation should be evaluated for osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency at the time of acceptance to the transplant waiting list.},

  abstract={This retrospective study compares clinical outcome following two different types of surgery for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Forty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures causing encroachment of the spinal canal greater than 50% were operated on within 30 days performing either: combined anterior decompression and stabilisation and posterior stabilisation (Group 1) or posterior distraction and stabilisation using pedicle instrumentation (AO internal fixator) (Group 2). We evaluated: neurological status (Frankel Grade), spinal deformities, residual pain, and complications. The average follow-up was 6 years. There were no significant differences between the patients in both groups concerning age, sex, cause of injury and the presence of other severe injuries. Neurological dysfunction was present in 39% of all cases. Bony union occurred in all patients. Loss of reduction greater than 5 degrees and instrumentation failure occurred significantly more often in Group 2 compared to Group 1, but the kyphosis angle at late follow-up did not differ between groups, due to some degree of overcorrection initially after surgery in Group 2. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups, and all but one patient with neurological deficits improved by at least one Frankel grade. Indirect decompression of the spinal canal by posterior distraction and short-segment stabilisation with AO internal fixator is considered appropriate treatment for the majority of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. This is a less extensive surgical procedure than a combined anterior and posterior approach.},

  abstract={Although posterior plates are increasingly used to manage cervical spinal instability, long-term follow-up evaluation of patients with a critical analysis of efficacy and complications has not been reported. The authors have retrospectively analyzed the outcome in 44 consecutive patients (37 males and seven females, age range 16 to 80 years) treated with posterior cervical plates. The indications for instrumentation were instability due to trauma in 42 cases, tumor in one, and infection in one. In four patients the follow-up period was limited to 3, 5, 11, and 16 months. Two patients died of chronic medical problems 4 and 9 months after treatment. The remaining 38 patients were followed from 2 to 6 years (mean 46 months). One motion segment was stabilized in 23 patients using two-hole plates; two motion segments were stabilized in the other 21 patients using three-hole plates. In the majority of patients (37 cases), supplemental bone grafting was not used. Patients were immobilized postoperatively in a Philadelphia collar. Solid arthrodesis was achieved in 39 (93%) of 42 patients. Three patients required revision of the cervical plating: in one patient with a C-5 burst fracture, two-hole plates were applied at C5-6 and progressive kyphosis mandated anterior fusion; the second patient required posterior wiring due to screw pull-out resulting from a technical error in screw insertion; the third patient, who refused to wear an orthosis postoperatively, also developed screw pull-out. In two patients who went on to spinal fusion, there was an increase in sagittal kyphosis (6 degrees and 8 degrees) without clinical sequelae. Screw loosening was noted in five patients, involving eight (3.8%) of the 210 lateral mass screws; this complication resulted in instrumentation failure or increased kyphosis in three cases. There were two superficial infections. This analysis indicates that posterior cervical plating is highly effective; at long-term follow-up review the cervical spine was successfully stabilized in 93% of cases. Plate failure was related to faulty screw placement, failure to include sufficient motion segments, and noncompliance with postoperative orthoses. Halo vest immobilization was unnecessary and supplemental bone grafting was generally not required for recent trauma.},

  abstract={Transarticular screw fixation (TASF) is technically demanding, with high risk of vertebral artery (VA) injury. How to manage intraoperative VA injury and choose optimal alternative fixation becomes a concern of spinal surgeons. In this study, the management strategy for a patient with suspected intraoperative VA injury was analyzed. A 53-year-old woman developed type II odontoid fracture and brain stem injury due to a motor vehicle accident 3 months earlier. After conservative treatments, the brain stem injury improved, but with residual ocular motility defect in the right eye. The odontoid fracture did not achieve fusion with displacement and absorption of fracture fragments. After admission, atlantoaxial fixation using bilateral C1-2 transarticular screws (TASs) combined with C1 laminar hooks was planed. The first TAS was inserted successfully. Unfortunately, suspected VA injury developed during tapping the tract for the second TAS. Considering the previous brain stem injury and that directly inserting the screw to tamponade the hemorrhage might cause VA stenosis or occlusion, we blocked the screw trajectory with bone wax. C2 laminar screw was implanted instead of intended TAS on the injured side. The management strategy for suspected VA injury should depend on intraoperative circumstances and be tailored to patients. Blocking screw trajectory with bone wax is a useful method to stop bleeding. Atlantoaxial fixation using C2 laminar screw and C1-2 TAS combined with C1 laminar hooks is an ideal alternative procedure.},

  abstract={The findings of this study emphasize the importance of distraction in obtaining and maintaining reduction in upper thoracic fractures that are unstable and collapsing into kyphosis. It also shows that a Luque rectangle construct cannot fulfill this function adequately in this type of fracture. Thirty-four consecutive cases of surgically treated upper thoracic spine fractures were reviewed. Two patients died, and 4 were lost to follow-up, so after a minimum 6-month clinical and radiographic follow-up there were 11 patients in the Luque group and 17 in the distraction rod group. Preoperatively, there was no significant difference in age, sex, level of injury or severity of kyphosis between the two groups. The Luque stabilization took an average of 1 h longer. There was no difference in local, general or neurological complications between the groups. Pain at the final follow-up was the same according to analgesic use. The kyphosis in the Luque group increased progressively from preoperative to postoperative values continued and to increase. In the distraction rod group the postoperative kyphosis was improved compared with the preoperative values. At final follow-up the kyphosis had returned nearly to the preoperative values. The difference in the adequacy of the reduction as measured by percentage of anterior collapse between the two groups is highly statistically significant: distraction rod better postoperatively, P = 0.0114 (Student's t-test); distraction rod better at final follow-up, P = 0.0054 (Student's t-test).},

  abstract={In unstable thoracolumbar fractures T11-L2, exaggerated kyphosis at the end of treatment may predispose to late back pain and poor functional outcome. Short-segment (SS) (3 vertebrae) pedicle instrumentation has become a popular method of treatment. However the question to add a fusion or not is still under debate. The authors retrospectively evaluated the radiological and functional results in 74 patients who had undergone an SS pedicle screw fixation. They were divided into two groups: group 1 (39 patients) was the non-fusion group; group 2 (35 patients) was the fusion group. In the non-fusion group the mean preoperative, immediate postoperative and final kyphosis angles at the fracture site were respectively 20.8 degrees +/- 6.4, 8.2 degrees +/- 4.8, and 15.2 degrees +/- 6.0. In the fusion group the corresponding angles were 26.6 degrees +/- 4.1, 7.9 degrees +/- 2.1, and 8.4 degrees +/- 2.4, which demonstrated a distinctly better final result (p < 0.0001). In the non-fusion group the preoperative, immediate postoperative and final follow-up visual analog scores (VAS) for back pain were respectively 7.3 +/- 0.8, 3.9 +/- 0.8, and 3.4 +/- 0.9. In the fusion group the corresponding scores were 7.5 +/- 1.0, 3.9 +/- 1.1, and 1.6 +/- 0.7; the final result pleaded again in favour of fusion (p < 0.0001). Moreover, there were significantly more implant-related complications (screw loosening and breakage) in the non-fusion group (p < 0.0001). The authors conclude that fusion is advisable to obtain a better final outcome with respect to kyphosis and pain, and to avoid implant-related complications. However, at least one other study has led to the opposite conclusion: the issue remains controversial.},

The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the osteosynthesis after screw fixation and postoperative bracing. In the 32 cases, 19 patients underwent single screw and 13 underwent double screw fixation. Postoperatively, light head halter traction was applied with the patients in bed for 1 to 4 weeks followed by a halo-vest for 8 to 14 weeks. Fractures healed in 9 weeks on average. There were no cases of delayed union. The overall results were excellent in 26 cases (81.3%), good in 5 (15.6%), and fair in 1 (3.1%) patient (who had a type Il fracture). There were no difference in dens union patterns between those receiving one-screw and two-screw fixation, and there were no complications during or after the operative procedure. Postoperatively there were no restriction of motion in the neck and no residual neck pain. Direct osteosynthesis of the fractured dens with screws is an effective procedure for unstable type II and III fracture of the dens. Postoperative external immobilization with a cervical brace seems to be an important contributing factor to the equal fusion rates in both groups of patients.},

Average time to surgery, hospital stay, and time to brace discontinuance were lower in the segmental wire group. Pain and work status at final follow-up were similar in the two groups. There was a higher incidence of superior and inferior hook migration and reoperation for this complication in patients treated with Harrington rods alone. There was no significant difference in postoperative correction of deformity, although at follow-up, there was greater recurrence of deformity in the Harrington rod group. In summary, the use of segmental wires to supplement Harrington rod fixation appears to offer advantages over Harrington rods alone, with minimal or no increased risk.},

  abstract={A prospective investigation of internal fixation of acute thoracic and lumbar spine fractures using pedicle screws and dynamic compression plates was performed. This article details the results of 23 patients who were followed for an average of 20 months. The indications for the procedure were an unstable fracture--dislocation below the eighth thoracic vertebra or low lumbar fractures that would be difficult to treat with conventional spinal implants. The patients were divided into three groups based on the fracture pattern and the level of the fracture. Group I consisted of fracture--dislocation injuries at the thoracic level and thoracolumbar junction. Group II patients sustained lumbar fracture--dislocations, and Group III contained lumbar burst fractures. Sagittal and coronal angles as well as anterior and posterior vertebral body height were measured at the injury level preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3-month intervals. Statistical analysis of these angles demonstrated that Group I and III patients had significant correction of their relative kyphotic deformity after surgery; however, there were no differences in kyphotic angle at the 3-month interval. Despite this eventual return to preoperative angles, all patients except one developed solid fusion. There was no increase in neurologic deficit. One patient developed an asymptomatic pseudarthrosis demonstrated by breakage of both plates through unfilled screw holes at the motion segment. Other complications included one wound infection, one case of arachnoiditis after an intradural bone fragment was excised, and one dural tear created by a Kirschner wire, which did not result in a neurologic deficit or a cerebrospinal fluid leak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract={It is generally acknowledged that short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is the preferred surgical method for thoracolumbar fractures. However, the use of short-segment instrumentation with or without intermediate screws at the fracture level remains controversial.We retrospectively evaluated 44 patients (28 men, 16 women) with unstable thoracolumbar fractures. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical method used. In group 1, 24 patients underwent surgery with a posterior approach via short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation (1 level above and 1 level below the fractured level). In group 2, 20 patients received an additional 2 screws at the fractured vertebrae. Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery and at 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.We found no significant difference in the demographic characteristics between the 2 groups. No significant difference was observed in the operative time and intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Clinical outcomes also showed no significant differences between the groups preoperatively or at all follow-up periods. The correction of the Cobb angle (CA) 1 week after surgery was better in group 2, whereas the anterior vertebral body height of the fractured level (AVHF) and compression ratio of the AVHF (AVHFCR) were not significantly different between the 2 groups 1 week after surgery. Moreover, group 2 had better maintenance of restored CA, AVHF, and AVHFCR at the fractured level than did group 1 at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. In addition, the reduction of mid-sagittal diameter (MSD) of spinal canal 1 week and 1 year after surgery was better in group 2. Besides, bone fragments in the spinal canal have a tendency to be less in group 2 1 week and 1 year after surgery.Reinforcement with intermediate screws for a single thoracolumbar fracture not only enhanced the stability of the internal fixation system, but it was also conducive to the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the reduction effects. Furthermore, this method is helpful to restore the spinal canal and reduce the bone fragments in the spinal canal. However, more long-term follow-up studies are needed.},

  abstract={Rationale and objectives: 
We investigated the efficacy of prophylactic cement injection into the vertebral body adjacent to fractured vertebra to prevent new fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV).
Materials and methods: 
Between February 2002 to August 2004, PV was performed for osteoporotic compression fractures in 89 consecutive patients. All patients underwent PV for only fractured vertebrae. Between September 2004 and October 2006, we performed prophylactic cement injection for 155 patients, with cement injected into the non-fractured vertebra adjacent to the fractured vertebra, immediately above the fractured vertebra in the same procedure. We evaluated the frequency of new vertebral fractures and the efficacy of prophylactic therapy.
Results: 
In the non-prophylactic group, 15 of 89 patients (16.8%) developed new fractures within 3 months and 20 of 89 patients (22.4%) developed new painful compression fractures within a year after the first PV. These fractures occurred mostly in adjacent vertebra, particularly in the vertebra immediately superior to the treated one and occurred in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. In the prophylactic group, 7 of 155 patients (4.5%) developed new compression fractures within 3 months and 15 of 155 patients (9.7%) developed new compression fractures within 1 year. Statistical analysis showed that fewer new fractures developed in the prophylactic group than in the non-prophylactic group at both 3 months (P = .0020, Fisher's exact test) and 1 year (P = .0079).
Conclusions: 
Prophylactic cement injection into non-fractured vertebrae adjacent to fractured vertebrae may prevent new compression fractures after vertebroplasty for osteoporotic patients.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To compare the characteristics of osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) with intravertebral fluid (IVF) and those with intravertebral air (IVA), and the efficacy of percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) in treating OVFs with these 2 different intravertebral components.
Summary of background data: 
Previous studies have focused on the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and PKP in treating OVFs with intravertebral cleft. However, no prior studies investigated the impact of the different components of cleft on the therapeutic effect of PVP or PKP.
Methods: 
On the basis of the presence of IVF or IVA signal on preoperative MR images, 22 patients were classified into IVF group and 13 patients into IVA group. The characteristics of patients with IVF and those with IVA were compared. The anterior and middle heights of the involved vertebrae, the kyphotic angles, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were recorded preoperatively, 1 day after surgery, and at last follow-up.
Results: 
Severe collapse of involved vertebrae (P=0.024) and the gap appearance of clefts (P=0.004) were significantly more common in IVA group than in IVF group. The vertebral heights, the local kyphotic angles, the VAS, and ODI scores were all significantly improved after PKP in both groups. However, the vertebral height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction were more significant in IVF group than in IVA group (P<0.001). No significant differences regarding VAS and ODI scores were detected between the 2 groups at each follow-up time.
Conclusions: 
PKP is an effective treatment strategy for both OVFs with IVF and with IVA, whereas vertebral height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction are much more significant in vertebrae with IVF. Presence of IVA without fluid filling-in on MR images may indicate an advanced stage of intravertebral osteonecrosis.},

  abstract={Background: 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness between percutaneous and open pedicle screw fixation for treating thoracolumbar fractures with spinal injuries.
Methods: 
A total of 105 patients with thoracolumbar fractures and spinal injuries were divided into a percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) group with 56 patients, who underwent percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, and an open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) group with 49 patients, who underwent open pedicle screw fixation in accordance with the treatment project. Relative operation indexes, radiologic, and effectiveness parameters were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.
Results: 
Demographic and clinical features including age, body mass index, gender, fracture level, fracture classification, and Frankel grade in both groups were not significantly different (all P >.05). The PPSF group exhibits significantly lower operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, and hospital stay on average compared with the OPSF group (all P < .05). Besides, the average postoperative radiologic parameters, including Cobb angle (CA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), vertebral front height percentage (VFHP), and sagittal index (SI), in both the groups were not significantly different (all P > .05). Nevertheless, both visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) after surgery decreased more substantially in the PPSF group than in the OPSF group (all P < .05) while no significant difference in VAS scores or ODI during the last follow-up period was demonstrated in both the groups (both P > .05). Frankel classifications were stimulated in both the groups during the last follow-up period.
Conclusion: 
PPSF has a smaller incision, less intraoperative blood loss, shorter recovery time, higher safety measures on average compared with OPSF with respect to managing thoracolumbar fractures with spinal injuries.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine can cause pain, long-term reductions in quality of life (QOL), and neural deficits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of methylene blue (MB) on preventing postoperative pain and improving QOL in patients with throracolumbar fractures undergoing posterior pedicle screw fixation.
Methods: 
Fifty patients underwent standard posterior pedicular screw fixation for stabilization of the thoracolumbar fractures: 25 received 1ml of MB solution at a concentration of 0.5% and 25 received normal saline on the soft tissue around fusion site. Primary outcomes were the control of pain, evaluated at 48h, 2 and 6 months after surgery with the use of a visual analog scale (VAS), and the improvement of QOL, assessed 2 and 6 months postoperatively by means of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire.
Results: 
The mean VAS scores for pain were significantly lower in the MB group compared with the control group at 2 months (1.30±0.45 vs. 2.60±1.19, P<0.001) and 6 months (1.17±0.37 vs. 1.60±0.87; P=0.028) after treatment. At 2 months after the surgery, the mean ODI score was significantly lower in the MB-treated patients than the control group (20.4±10.92 vs. 34.8±15.11; P=0.001). The ODI score in the MB-treated patients was better than the control group at 6 months after the surgery (12.2±11.66 vs. 20.8±11.14; P=0.016).
Conclusion: 
A single dose of MB on the soft tissue around fusion site shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain, and functional results when compared with placebo 6 months after surgery.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Blood loss with spinal surgery is common potential cause of morbidity and often requires blood transfusion. Tranexamic acid (TXA), is effective in reducing bleeding in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. TXA used in spine surgery studies have included different cases leading to inconsistence of surgical procedures. Purpose of this prospective observational study was to examine effect of TXA decreasing bleeding in short segment pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
38 patients' undergoing short segment pedicle screw for thoracolumbar fractures were enrolled in study from July 2011 to August 2013. There were 28 male and 10 female patients, with an average age of 36.5 years. Patients received 10 mg/kg of TXA or a control 30 minutes intravenously before skin incision and 3 hours post-operative and oral medication for three days. Intraoperative bleeding was estimated by weighing surgical sponges, blood collected by suction container and by subtracting all irrigation fluid. Postoperative bleeding was measured from volume in vacuum drainage bag.
Results: 
Twenty (20) patients were in control group and eighteen(18) to TXA group. There were no statistical differences between groups in terms of age, gender, co-morbidities, and operating time, preoperative Hemoglobin, PT and INR. Intra-operative bleeding in TXA group was significant than in control group. Post-operative drainage and Hemoglobin in first 48 h was reduced compared with placebo in TXA group. Need for post-operative transfusion was nil in TXA group.
Conclusions: 
Administration of TXA before surgery significantly reduces perioperative bleeding in patients undergoing short segment pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar spine fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Pediatric spine trauma often results from high-energy mechanisms. Despite differences in healing potential, comorbidities, and length of remaining life, treatment is frequently based on adult criteria; ligamentous injuries are fused and bony injuries are treated accordingly. In this study, we present short-term results of a select group of adolescent patients treated using percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation without fusion.
Methods: 
An IRB-approved retrospective review was performed at a level 1 pediatric trauma center for thoracolumbar spine fractures treated by percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. Patients were excluded if arthrodesis was performed or if instrumentation was not removed. Demographics, injury mechanism, associated injuries, fracture classification, surgical data, radiographic measures, and complications were collected. Radiographs were analyzed for sagittal and coronal wedge angles and vertebral body height ratio and statistical comparisons performed on preoperative and postoperative values.
Results: 
Between 2005 and 2013, 46 patients were treated surgically. Fourteen patients (5 male, 9 female) met inclusion criteria. Injury mechanisms included 8 motor vehicle collisions, 4 falls, and 2 all-terrain vehicle/motorcycle collisions. There were 8 Magerl type A injuries, 4 type B injuries, and 2 type C injuries. There was 1 incomplete spinal cord injury. Implants were removed between 5 and 12 months in 12 patients and after 12 months in 2 patients. Statistical analysis revealed significant postoperative improvement in all radiographic measures (P<0.05). There were no neurological complications, 1 superficial wound dehiscence, and 2 instrumentation failures (treated with standard removal). At last follow-up, 11 patients returned to unrestricted activities including sports. Average follow-up was 9 months after implant removal and 19.3 months after index procedure.
Conclusions: 
Adolescent thoracolumbar fractures present unique challenges and treatment opportunities different from the adult patient. We present a nonconsecutive series of 14 patients temporarily stabilized with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for injuries including 3-column fracture dislocations and purely ligamentous injuries. Temporary fusionless instrumentation can provide successful management of select thoracolumbar spine injuries in pediatric trauma patients.
Level of evidence: 
Level IV-Retrospective case series.},

  abstract={Background context: 
The incidence of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is approximately 50% in patients treated for >6 months, and in the long-term usage fracture risk is approximately 34%. The awareness of pediatric vertebral fractures due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is increasing. Although most of these fractures are asymptomatic, a small number of children may have severe pain.
Purpose: 
In this case report we are presenting long-term result of a 9-year-old patient with intractable pain due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic vertebral fracture managed by kyphoplasty.
Study design: 
Case report.
Patient sample: 
Case report of a 9-year-old girl who had L3 vertebral fracture due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis treated by kyphoplasty.
Methods: 
The patient was a 9-year-old girl with severe back pain, and lupus nephritis. Glucocorticoid-induced L3 vertebral fracture was detected and the case was resistant to conservative treatment. Seeing this, we have performed balloon kyphoplasty procedure to L3 vertebrae.
Results: 
No complication and pain was observed after the operation although L3 vertebral height could not restored. On the 8-year control, L3 vertebral height was almost totally restored with a compression index of 10% without any clinical problem.
Conclusions: 
To the best of the authors' knowledge, the patient sample of this case report is the first and the youngest patient who was treated with kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fracture intractable pain due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, mentioned in literature. During the 8-year follow-up, no adverse effect was reported that was related to kyphoplasty procedure. This case report indicates that kyphoplasty can be an alternative method for selective pediatric intractable painful vertebral glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic fractures, but it should be performed after careful consideration in pediatric group. We do not advise routine usage of kyphoplasty for pediatric vertebral fractures.},

Three patients had a T12, six patients an L1, and three patients had an L2 lesion. Patients in the two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and time since operation. No significant differences were found in the time-distance, kinematic, and kinetic gait characteristics between the two groups. This preliminary study reveals that the gait characteristics of patients with short and long-segment fusion after thoracolumbar burst fractures were similar to those of healthy subjects and did not differ from each other. However, the present results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Future studies with larger groups are needed to provide additional data to validate these findings.},

  abstract={Background: 
A growing population of patients with osteoporosis and fragility fractures has developed. Fragility fractures, including vertebral compression fractures, have been associated with increased mortality. Early operative interventions for patients sustaining hip fractures have been found to reduce mortality.
Purpose: 
To determine if kyphoplasty improves survival after vertebral compression fractures.
Study design: 
A retrospective chart review of all kyphoplasty procedures performed by the same orthopedic surgeon between June 2000 and June 2004 and a review of patients receiving nonoperative care consisting of oral analgesia and an orthosis during the same time period were conducted.
Patient sample: 
Patients seen by a single surgeon for an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture.
Outcome measures: 
The primary outcome measured was patient death within the study time period.
Methods: 
Data from both groups were tabulated and analyzed for statistical differences by Student t test and chi-squared analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves comparing age, medical comorbidity, and surgical intervention were constructed. Log-rank test was used to analyze the survival curves.
Results: 
Of the 94 patients who elected for kyphoplasty, 38 patients were deceased at the close of the current study which ended in September 2006, whereas 26 of the 90 patients who elected for conservative therapy had died. Student t test revealed a significant age difference between patients treated with kyphoplasty and those who were treated nonoperatively (p=.0002). Chi-squared analysis revealed a significant difference between the two populations with respect to Charlson score (p=.050) but no statistical difference between the two populations with respect to ASA (p=.81) or gender (p=.1207). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to independently assess the influence of age, medical comorbidity, and kyphoplasty on survival. A significant relationship was detected by log-rank test for age (p=.0172), ASA (p=.0497), and Charlson score (p=.0015) but not treatment with kyphoplasty (p=.1037). An age-adjusted mortality rate was calculated and was found to be 35.3 per 1,000 patient-years for the conservative treatment population and 40.1 for the surgical population. A multivariate analysis comparing age, comorbidity, and surgical treatment with survival did not detect a statistical relationship.
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty did not seem to effect the survival of patients with a vertebral compression fracture.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective review of all percutaneous vertebroplasties performed in the authors' institution from November 1994 to June 2002. OBJECTIVE.: To determine the factors affecting the outcome of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of persistent painful osteoporotic fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient procedure to treat pain due to osteoporotic vertebral fracture. However, the patient population that is most likely to benefit from this procedure is uncertain, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for an ideal candidate have varied widely in the literature.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of 278 percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures for osteoporotic fractures at 423 levels was performed. Sociodemographic, clinical, radiologic, and procedural data were analyzed as parameters for prognosis significance by univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression to estimate the strength of influence of each variable.
Results: 
The presence of two or less symptomatic vertebrae (P < 0.03), the American Society of Anesthesiologists status I (P < 0.001), the presence of signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging (P < 0001), and the collapse of the vertebral body less than 70% (P < 0.001) were assessed as parameters for prognostic significance. Multivariate analysis also showed a significant correlation between the American Society of Anesthesiologists score and height loss of the vertebral body and the final outcome. The presence of signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging showed the highest odds ratio adjusted.
Conclusions: 
Appropriate patient selection is essential for achieving clinical success. Better results can be expected in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of I and when the level managed is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the vertebral body height loss is less than 70%.},

Due to the increasing interest in vertebroplasty in Germany the German Radiological Society-Working Group on Interventional Radiology decided to produce guidelines for percutaneous vertebroplasty. This guidelines are based on the recent standard of knowledge and represent a guide for practical performance of this procedure. Based on the technical development of the method, indications and implementation of the method in multimodal therapy regimens may change over the next years.

  abstract={Introduction: 
This is a retrospective study to determine the effects of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty on quality of life in multiple myeloma patients with spinal compression fractures.
Material and methods: 
Thirty-four patients with primary multiple myeloma were treated for symptomatic compression fractures between June 2003 and June 2005. Kyphoplasty was applied to 22 levels in 18 and vertebroplasty to 28 levels in 16 patients. The pain-related disability was evaluated for every single daily living activity using visual analog scale (VAS) over 10 points. (pain at rest, walking, sitting-standing, taking a shower and wearing clothes). (This evaluation is performed to every patient with degenerative disorders of the spine upon admission to our clinic.) Overall VAS scores were evaluated over 50 points (0 minimum, 50 maximum) preoperatively, at postoperative six weeks, six months and at one year prior to taking analgesics. The amount of analgesic use was recorded. Data was analyzed statistically using variance analysis, Friedman's multiple comparison test and Student's t test.
Results: 
The mean overall pain score in the kyphoplasty group decreased from a preoperative value of 36 to 12.13 at the sixth postoperative week, to 8.63 at the sixth month and to 9.72 at one year. (p<0.001). The mean overall pain score in the vertebroplasty group decreased from a preoperative value of 37.83 to 15.33 at the sixth postoperative week, to 12.17 at sixth months and to 13.47 at one year. (p<0.001). Student's t test was used to analyze the percentage of differences in overall pain score. Difference between groups was not statistically significant at the sixth week (p=0.106) but was statistically significant both at the sixth month (p=0.024) and at one year (p=0.027) in favor of kyphoplasty group. No secondary collapse was observed in adjacent levels in both groups. There were no intrapostoperative neurologic/pulmonary complications in both groups. Analgesics usage significantly decreased in both groups.
Conclusion: 
In multiple myeloma, when pathological spinal compression fractures cause intractable pain and are unresponsive to conservative treatment, both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective in increasing quality of life and decreasing pain.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE Percutaneous instrumentation in thoracolumbar fractures is intended to decrease paravertebral muscle damage by avoiding dissection. The aim of this study was to compare muscles at instrumented levels in patients who were treated by open or percutaneous surgery. METHODS Twenty-seven patients underwent open instrumentation, and 65 were treated percutaneously. A standardized MRI protocol using axial T1-weighted sequences was performed at a minimum 1-year follow-up after implant removal. Two independent observers measured cross-sectional areas (CSAs, in cm2) and region of interest (ROI) signal intensity (in pixels) of paravertebral muscles by using OsiriX at the fracture level, and at cranial and caudal instrumented pedicle levels. An interobserver comparison was made using the Bland-Altman method. Reference ROI muscle was assessed in the psoas and ROI fat subcutaneously. The ratio ROI-CSA/ROI-fat was compared for patients treated with open versus percutaneous procedures by using a linear mixed model. A linear regression analyzed additional factors: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Pfirrmann grade of adjacent discs, and duration of instrumentation in situ. RESULTS The interobserver agreement was good for all CSAs. The average CSA for the entire spine was 15.7 cm2 in the open surgery group and 18.5 cm2 in the percutaneous group (p = 0.0234). The average ROI-fat and ROI-muscle signal intensities were comparable: 497.1 versus 483.9 pixels for ROI-fat and 120.4 versus 111.7 pixels for ROI-muscle in open versus percutaneous groups. The ROI-CSA varied between 154 and 226 for open, and between 154 and 195 for percutaneous procedures, depending on instrumented levels. A significant difference of the ROI-CSA/ROI-fat ratio (0.4 vs 0.3) was present at fracture levels T12-L1 (p = 0.0329) and at adjacent cranial (p = 0.0139) and caudal (p = 0.0100) instrumented levels. Differences were not significant at thoracic levels. When adjusting based on age, BMI, and Pfirrmann grade, a significant difference between open and percutaneous procedures regarding the ROI-CSA/ROI-fat ratio was present in the lumbar spine (p < 0.01). Sex and duration of instrumentation had no significant influence. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous instrumentation decreased muscle atrophy compared with open surgery. The MRI signal differences for T-12 and L-1 fractures indicated less fat infiltration within CSAs in patients who received percutaneous treatment. Differences were not evidenced at thoracic levels, where CSAs were smaller. Fat infiltration was not significantly different at lumbar levels with either procedure in elderly patients with associated discopathy and higher BMI. In younger patients, there was less fat infiltration of lumbar paravertebral muscles with percutaneous procedures.},

  abstract={Rationale: 
Thoracic-lumbar vertebral fracture is very common in clinic, and late post-traumatic kyphosis is the main cause closely related to the patients' life quality, which has evocated extensive concern for the surgical treatment of the disease. This study aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes and surgical strategies for late post-traumatic kyphosis after failed thoracolumbar fracture operation.
Patient concerns: 
All patients presented back pain with kyphotic apex vertebrae between T12 and L3. According to Frankel classification grading system, among them, 3 patients were classified as grade D, with the ability to live independently.
Diagnoses: 
A systematic review of 12 case series of post-traumatic kyphosis after failed thoracolumbar fracture operation was involved.
Interventions: 
Wedge osteotomy was performed as indicated-posterior closing osteotomy correction in 5 patients and anterior open-posterior close correction in 7 patients.Postoperatively, thoracolumbar x-rays were obtained to evaluate the correction of kyphotic deformity, visual analog scales (VAS) and Frankel grading system were used for access the clinical outcomes.
Outcomes: 
All the patients were followed up, with the average period of 38.5 months (range 24-56 months). The Kyphotic Cobb angle was improved from preoperative (28.65 ± 11.41) to postoperative (1.14 ± 2.79), with the correction rate of 96.02%. There was 1 case of intraoperative dural tear, without complications such as death, neurological injury, and wound infection. According to Frankel grading system, no patient suffered deteriorated neurological symptoms after surgery, and 2 patients (2/3) experienced significant relief after surgery. The main VAS score of back pain was improved from preoperative (4.41 ± 1.08) to postoperative (1.5 ± 0.91) at final follow-up, with an improvement rate of 65.89%.
Lessons: 
Surgical treatment of late post-traumatic kyphosis after failed thoracolumbar fracture operation can obtain good radiologic and clinical outcomes by kyphosis correction, decompression, and posterior stability.},

  abstract={Background: 
Fractures of the odontoid process of the axis are the most common fractures of the geriatric cervical spine. As the population ages, their incidence is expected to increase progressively, as is the number of very old patients (>80 years) with an odontoid fracture. No consensus exists on the optimal treatment (surgical or conservative) and the most relevant outcome parameter (osseous union, fracture stability or clinical outcome). The aim of the INNOVATE (INterNational study on Odontoid frActure Treatment in the Elderly) Trial is to prospectively assess fracture healing and clinical outcome after surgical and conservative treatment for odontoid fractures in the elderly patient, with a specific focus on the very old patient.
Methods::Design: 
The trial is an observational study in which eleven centres in five European countries are involved. All patients admitted to one of these centres who meet the selection criteria (≥55 years, acute (<two weeks) type II/III odontoid fracture, no rheumatoid arthritis, no ankylosing spondylitis, no previous treatment for odontoid fracture) are asked to participate. The applied treatment is in accordance with usual care and chosen by the treating surgeon and patient. A cohort of 275 patients will be included. Clinical and radiological follow-up moments are scheduled at 6, 12, 26, 52 and 104 weeks, at which both surgeon and patient will complete Case Record Forms (CRFs). The primary outcome will be a combination of fracture healing and clinical outcome at 52 weeks. Osseous union and fracture stability will be assessed with CT-imaging and dynamic X-ray. Clinical outcome will be scored by the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and correlated to the imaging data. Additionally, predefined subgroup analysis will be carried out (i.e. for patient age and osteoporosis) and prognostic factors will be identified.
Discussion: 
Evidence for the optimal treatment for odontoid fractures is lacking. Focusing on both fracture healing and clinical outcome, the results of this study will yield valuable information enabling more rational decision making in the treatment for odontoid fractures in the elderly.

Systematic review of literature.
Objective: 
To determine the optimal indications and methods of surgical treatment for unstable type II odontoid fractures in skeletally mature individuals.
Summary of background data: 
Odontoid fractures are a frequently encountered injury pattern in the cervical spine. The surgical treatment of type II odontoid fractures varies among spinal surgeons. The optimal surgical indications and treatment for type II odontoid fractures remains unclear.
Methods: 
Five primary research questions, based on safety and efficacy, were determined by consensus of a panel of spine trauma surgeons consisting of fellowship trained orthopedic and neurologic surgeons. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed using MeSH search terms in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews. The quality of literature was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Using the GRADE evidence-based review system, the primary questions were answered using the literature review and expert opinion. These treatment recommendations were then rated as either strong or weak based on the quality of evidence and clinical expertise.
Results: 
The initial search resulted in over 1300 results. After initial application of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 458 abstracts were reviewed from which 22 manuscripts were found to meet all criteria. These were obtained, reviewed, and used to create an evidentiary table. All articles were of either low or very low quality.
Conclusion: 
There is no moderate or high quality literature on the surgical management of acute type II odontoid fractures. Optimal indications for either anterior or posterior treatment of fractures are described but with no comparative data. A single anterior odontoid screw is the recommended technique for anterior treatment. Posterior internal fixation (C1-C2 transarticular screw, C1-C2 segmental fixation) is the recommended technique for posterior treatment. In equivocally indicated instances, anterior or posterior treatment can be safely used with good outcome. In this scenario, surgical management decision should be influenced by surgeon and patient preference as well as cost considerations.},

  abstract={Knowledge on the outcome of C2-fractures is founded on heterogenous samples with cross-sectional outcome assessment focusing on union rates, complications and technical concerns related to surgical treatment. Reproducible clinical and functional outcome assessments are scant. Validated generic and disease specific outcome measures were rarely applied. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the radiographic, functional and clinical outcome of a patient sample with C2-fractures. Out of a consecutive series of 121 patients with C2 fractures, 44 met strict inclusion criteria and 35 patients with C2-fractures treated either nonsurgically or surgically with motion-preserving techniques were surveyed. Outcome analysis included validated measures (SF-36, NPDI, CSOQ), and a functional CT-scanning protocol for the evaluation of C1-2 rotation and alignment. Mean follow-up was 64 months and mean age of patients was 52 years. Classification of C2-fractures at injury was performed using a detailed morphological description: 24 patients had odontoid fractures type II or III, 18 patients had fracture patterns involving the vertebral body and 11 included a dislocated or a burst lateral mass fracture. Thirty-one percent of patients were treated with a halo, 34% with a Philadelphia collar and 34% had anterior odontoid screw fixation. At follow-up mean atlantoaxial rotation in left and right head position was 20.2 degrees and 20.6 degrees, respectively. According to the classification system of posttreatment C2-alignment established by our group in part I of the C2-fracture study project, mean malunion score was 2.8 points. In 49% of patients the fractures healed in anatomical shape or with mild malalignment. In 51% fractures healed with moderate or severe malalignment. Self-rated outcome was excellent or good in 65% of patients and moderate or poor in 35%. The raw data of varying nuances allow for comparison in future benchmark studies and metaanalysis. Detailed investigation of C2-fracture morphology, posttreatment C2-alignment and atlantoaxial rotation allowed a unique outcome analysis that focused on the identification of risk factors for poor outcome and the interdependencies of outcome variables that should be addressed in studies on C2-fractures. We recognized that reduced rotation of C1-2 per se was not a concern for the patients. However, patients with worse clinical outcomes had reduced total neck rotation and rotation C1-2. In turn, C2-fractures, especially fractures affecting the lateral mass that healed with atlantoaxial deformity and malunion, had higher incidence of atlantoaxial degeneration and osteoarthritis. Patients with increased severity of C2-malunion and new onset atlantoaxial arthritis had worse clinical outcomes and significantly reduced rotation C1-2. The current study offers detailed insight into the radiographical, functional and clinical outcome of C2-fractures. It significantly adds to the understanding of C2-fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The association between osteoarthritis (OA) and fractures remains unclear. OA patients have increased bone mass, but no corresponding decrease in fracture rate. This study was undertaken to determine the fracture rates in patients with hip OA undergoing a total hip replacement (THR), as compared with disease-free controls, and to assess the association between bisphosphonate use and postsurgery fracture risk.
Methods: 
We conducted a population-based parallel-cohorts study. All patients in the UK General Practice Research Database undergoing a THR for hip OA between 1986 and 2006 constituted the exposed cohort (n = 14,133). Five disease-free controls were matched with each patient by age, sex, and practice site. Subjects were followed up for 5 years before and after surgery. Fracture rates and rate ratios (RRs) were estimated using Poisson regression. In addition, bisphosphonate use was identified among patients undergoing THR, and the data, stratified by the presence or absence of a previous fracture and by treatment propensity score, were assessed using fitted Cox models to study the effect of bisphosphonate use on the risk of fracture postsurgery.
Results: 
Patients undergoing a THR had a similar fracture risk as that in controls in the 5 years before THR, but had higher rates postsurgery, which peaked at years 2.5-5 (adjusted RR 1.24, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.02-1.52). Use of bisphosphonates lowered the fracture risk among THR patients who received bisphosphonates as primary prevention (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.82) and also among THR patients who had experienced a previous osteoporotic fracture (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.99).
Conclusion: 
This study identified a 25% increase in fracture risk at 2.5-5 years postsurgery among patients undergoing a THR. Bisphosphonate use reduced the post-THR risk of fracture when administered both as primary prevention and as secondary prevention, by 44% and 52%, respectively. This must be further confirmed in randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract={Background context: 
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health mandated a nationwide health technology assessment-registry for balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for decision making on reimbursement of these interventions. The early results of the registry led to a permanent coverage of BKP by basic health insurance. The documentation was continued for further evidence generation.
Purpose: 
This analysis reports on the 1 year results of patients after BKP treatment.
Study design: 
Prospective multicenter observational case series.
Patient sample: 
The data on 625 cases with 819 treated vertebrae were documented from March 2005 to May 2012.
Outcome measures: 
Surgeon-administered outcome instruments were primary intervention form for BKP and the follow-up form; patient self-reported measures were EuroQol-5D questionnaire, North American Spine Society outcome instrument /Core Outcome Measures Index (including visual analog scale), and a comorbidity questionnaire. Outcome measures were back pain, medication, quality of life (QoL), cement extrusions, and new fractures within the first postoperative year.
Methods: 
Data were recorded preoperatively and at 3 to 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of pre- with postoperative measurements. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors with a significant influence on the outcome.
Results: 
Seventy percent of patients were women with mean age of 71 years (range, 18-91 years); mean age of men was 65 years (range, 15-93 years). Significant and clinically relevant reduction of back pain, improvement of QoL, and reduction of pain killer consumption was seen within the first postoperative year. Preoperative back pain decreased from 69.3 to 29.0 at 3 to 6-month and remained unchanged at 1-year follow-ups. Consequently, QoL improved from 0.23 to 0.71 and 0.75 at the same follow-up intervals. The overall vertebra-based cement extrusion rates with and without extrusions into intervertebral discs were 22.1% and 15.3%, respectively. Symptomatic cement extrusions with radiculopathy were five (0.8%). A new vertebral fracture within a year from the BKP surgery was observed in 18.4% of the patients.
Conclusions: 
The results of the largest observational study for BKP so far are consistent with published randomized trials and systematic reviews. In this routine health care setting, BKP is safe and effective in reducing pain, improving QoL, and lowering pain_killer consumption and has an acceptable rate of cement extrusions. Postoperative outcome results show clear and significant clinical improvement at early follow-up that remain stable during the first postoperative year.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Multicenter randomized controlled trial.
Objective: 
To compare the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) with nonsurgical management (NSM) during 24 months in patients with painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).
Summary of background data: 
Recently, several large randomized controlled trials have been conducted and reported how vertebral augmentation compares with NSM for patients with acute VCFs. Few of these trials report on the surgical aspects and radiographical vertebral deformity results.
Methods: 
Adults with 1 to 3 VCFs were randomized within 3 months of pain to undergo bilateral BKP (n = 149) or NSM (n = 151). Surgical parameters, subjective quality of life assessments and objective functional (timed up and go) and radiographical assessments were collected.
Results: 
Compared with NSM, the BKP group had greater improvements in SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores at 1 month (5.35 points; 95% CI, 3.41-7.30; P < 0.0001) and when averaged across the 24 months (overall treatment effect 2.71 points; 95% CI, 1.34-4.09; P = 0.0001). The kyphoplasty group also had greater functionality by assessing timed up and go (overall treatment effect -2.49 s; 95% CI, -0.82 to -4.15; P = 0.0036). At 24 months, the change in index fracture kyphotic angulation was statistically significantly improved in the kyphoplasty group (average 3.13° of correction for kyphoplasty compared with 0.82° in the control, P = 0.003). Number of baseline prevalent fractures (P = 0.0003) and treatment assignment (P = 0.004) are the most predictive variables for PCS improvement; however, in patients who underwent BKP, there may also be a link with kyphotic angulation. In BKP, the highest quart for kyphotic angulation correction had higher PCS improvement (13.4 points) than the quart having lowest correction of angulation (7.40 points, P = 0.0146 for difference). The most common adverse events temporally related to surgery (i.e., within 30 d) were back pain (20 BKP, 11 NSM) new VCF (11 BKP, 7 NSM), nausea/vomiting (12 BKP, 4 NSM), and urinary tract infection (10 BKP, 3 NSM). Several other adverse events were possibly related to patient positioning in the operating room.
Conclusion: 
Compared with NSM, BKP improves patient quality of life and pain averaged during 24 months and results in better improvement of index vertebral body kyphotic angulation. Perioperative complications may be reduced with more care in patient positioning.

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) with polymethylmethacrylate is widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture and satisfactory clinical outcomes have been reported in the literature. However, recurrent or persistent back pain after PV is not uncommon. Sometimes, the pain may result from pathogenesis within the previously treated vertebra. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of repeat PV for treating patients with recurrent back pain caused by the previously cemented vertebrae.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients who underwent repeat PV to treat symptomatic cemented vertebrae. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on clinical presentation and imaging studies: those with refracture (RF), residual vacuum (RV), and osteonecrosis (ON) along the bone-cement interface. A bipedicle approach was used for repeat PV in all patients. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and modified Brodsky criteria were used to evaluate clinical outcomes before and after surgery. The Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Spearman correlation analyses were used to analyze patient surgical prognosis and radiologic findings.
Results: 
Nine patients were diagnosed with RF, 5 with RV, and 4 with ON. The average VAS score was 77.1 (range, 62-90) before repeat PV (80.1, 72.4, and 76.3 for the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively) and 34.4 (range, 25-45) after repeat PV treatment (33.1, 36.8, and 34.3 for the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively). The VAS score significantly decreased in all 3 groups. The vertebral body height was significantly restored by a mean of 13.9% across all groups (17.8%, 12.7%, and 6.8% in the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively). Fifteen patients recovered from vertebral compression fracture and regained their preinjury activities of daily living. No surgery-related complications occurred except asymptomatic cement leakage in 5 patients.
Conclusions: 
The results of this research demonstrate that repeat PV may be an effective method for relieving recurrent or persistent pain in patients with symptomatic cemented vertebrae, allowing them to regain functional activity.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The aim of this study was to evaluate results of surgical stabilisation of hyperextension injuries of the thoracolumbar spine in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders using two different treatment strategies: the conventional open rigid posterior instrumentation and percutaneous less rigid posterior instrumentation. Surgical and non-surgical complications, the postoperative radiological course, and clinical outcome at final follow-up were comparatively assessed. Moreover, we sought to discuss important biomechanical and surgical aspects specific to posterior instrumentation of the ankylosed thoracolumbar spine as well as to elaborate on the advantages and limitations of the proposed new treatment strategy involving percutaneous less rigid stabilisation and fracture reduction by postoperative mobilisation.
Materials and methods: 
Between January 2006 and June 2012, a consecutive series of 20 patients were included in the study. Posterior instrumentation was performed either using an open approach with rigid 6.0 mm bars (open rigid (OR) group) or via a percutaneous approach using softer 5.5 mm bars (percutaneous less rigid (PLR) group). Complications as well as the radiological course were retrospectively assessed, and patient outcome was evaluated at final follow-up using validated outcome scores (VAS Spine Score, ODI, RMDQ, Parker Mobility Score, Barthel Score and WHOQOL-BREF).
Results: 
Surgical complications occurred more frequently in the OR group requiring revision surgery in two patients, while there was no revision surgery in the PLR group. The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the PLR group as well (0.7 vs. 1.3 complications per patient, respectively). Fracture reduction and restoration of pre-injury sagittal alignment by postoperative mobilisation occurred within the first 3 weeks in the PLR group, and within 6 months in the OR group. The clinical outcome at final follow-up was very good in both groups with no relevant loss in VAS Spine Score (pain and function), Parker Mobility Score (mobility), and Barthel Index (social independency) compared to pre-operative values.
Conclusions: 
This study indicates that the proposed treatment concept involving percutaneous less rigid posterior instrumentation and fracture reduction by postoperative mobilisation is feasible, seems to facilitate adequate reduction and restoration of pre-injury sagittal alignment, and might have the potential to reduce the rate of complications in the management of hyperextension injuries of the ankylosed thoracolumbar spine.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
This study compared the radiologic and clinical outcomes of kyphoplasty with intravertebral reduction device (IRD) and vertebroplasty (VP) in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Materials and methods: 
We enrolled 75 patients with OVCFs who were aged >60 years and treated them through VP or kyphoplasty with IRD. The radiologic outcomes, namely the anterior and middle body heights (ABH and MBH, respectively) and kyphotic angle (KA), were measured preoperatively and at postoperative 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The refracture was identified on the basis of a decrease in ABH, MBH, or KA compared with those at postoperative 1 week. Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and complications were recorded. The incidence of adjacent and nonadjacent fractures was also recorded.
Results: 
We treated 36 patients with kyphoplasty with IRD (IRD group) and 39 through VP (VP group). The patient characteristics were comparable in both groups. The KA and its restoration were more favorable after IRD than after VP. Although ABHs were not different in either group, their restoration was more efficient after IRD than after VP. MBHs, their restoration, and their refracture rates were better after IRD than after VP. VAS pain scores and complication rates were not different between the groups. The incidences of adjacent or nonadjacent fractures were not different between the 2 groups.
Conclusion: 
Our findings reveal significantly more efficient height restoration and kyphosis correction and fewer refractures in the IRD group. IRD may not increase the risk of adjacent or nonadjacent fractures.},

  abstract={In a recent randomized controlled trial comparing vertebroplasty (VP) versus conservative treatment (CT) in patients with symptomatic vertebral fractures (VF), we observed the development of chronic back pain (CBP) in nearly one-quarter of patients. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors related to the development of severe CBP in these subjects. We evaluated risk factors including visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and during the 1-year follow-up, age, gender, symptom onset time, number, type and severity of VF at baseline, number of vertebral bodies treated, incident VF, and antiosteoporotic treatment, among others. CBP was considered in patients with VAS ≥ 7 at 12 months. 91/125 patients completed the 12-months follow-up. CBP was observed in 23% of VP-treated patients versus 23% receiving CT. Patients developing CBP after VP showed a longer symptom onset time (82% ≥ 4 months in VP vs. 40% in CT, P = 0.03). On univariate analysis, female gender (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.47-1.57, P < 0.0001), multiple acute VF (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.71-1.87, P < 0.0001), VAS ≥ 7 two months after treatment (OR 11.04; 95% CI 6.71-18.17, P < 0.0001), and type of antiosteoporotic drug (teriparatide) (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.03-0.60, P = 0.0236) were risk factors of CBP development in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, the main risk factors were baseline and post-treatment VAS ≥ 7, longer symptom onset time, and type of antiosteoporotic treatment. In conclusion, 23% of patients with symptomatic osteoporotic VF developed severe CBP independently of the type of treatment. Symptom onset time before VP and persistence of severe CBP after treatment were the main factors related to CBP with teriparatide treatment decreasing the risk of this complication.},

The correlative factors for complications resulting from cement leakage were retrospectively reviewed in 71 patients who underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty.
Objective: 
To explore the correlative factors affecting the complications of percutaneous kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Over the past decade, percutaneous kyphoplasty has been increasingly used as treatment of choice for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, current literature contains less information about the correlative factors affecting the complications resulted from cement leakage.
Methods: 
In all, 71 patients with 171 vertebral compression fractures who were treated by percutaneous kyphoplasty in the department of spine surgery at our medical center were identified from the registry and were retrospectively reviewed. The treatment efficacy was determined by the assessment of change in vertebral body height, Cobb angle, visual analog scale and Oswestry functional score between preoperative, postoperative, and the latest follow-up. Complications were recorded and associated risk factors were determined and analyzed.
Results: 
All patients had immediate and significant improvement in back pain after being treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty. Cement leakage occurred in 17 (9.94%) out of 171 vertebral bodies, including 7 paravertebral leaks, 6 leaks into intervertebral space, 3 leaks into channel of needling insertion, and 1 spinal canal leak. Four patients (5.63%) developed pulmonary complications postoperatively, one of them with confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism directly caused by cement leakage. During the follow-up, we found 9 recurrence vertebral fractures in 6 patients (8.45%), including 6 adjacent vertebral bodies. Univariate analysis revealed a significant difference in preoperative vertebral body height, injected cement volume, and vertebral body wall incompetence between the cement leakage group and no cement leakage group (P<0.05). In contrast, there is no significant difference in the preoperative Cobb angle, freshness of vertebral fracture, location of operative vertebrae, and operative approach between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence were the predominant variables associated with the complications resulting from cement leakage. The patients who had a history of pulmonary diseases were prone to develop lung-related complications after the surgery.
Conclusions: 
The cement viscosity, injected cement volume, vertebral body wall incompetence, and a history of pulmonary diseases were the factors affecting the complications resulting from cement leakage. The recognition of these risk factors is helpful in efforts to improve surgical technique to reduce the risk of complications after being treated by percutaneous kyphoplasty.},

  abstract={Summary: 
Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a procedure used to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We developed a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in United Kingsdom patients with hospitalised VCFs and estimated the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to non-surgical management. The results indicate that BKP provides a cost-effective alternative for treating these patients.
Introduction: 
VCFs of osteoporotic patients are associated with chronic pain, a reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) and high healthcare costs. BKP is a minimally invasive procedure that has resulted in pain relief, vertebral body height-restoration, decreased kyphosis and improved physical functioning in patients with symptomatic VCFs. BKP was shown to improve health-related QoL in a 12-month interim analysis of a randomised phase-III trial.
Methods: 
The objectives of this study were to develop a Markov cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in patients with painful hospitalised VCFs and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared with non-surgical management in a UK setting. It was assumed that QoL-benefits found at 12 months linearly approached zero during another 2 years, and that patients receiving BKP warranted six fewer hospital bed days compared with patients given non-surgical management.
Results: 
The procedure was associated with quality-adjusted life-years (QALY)-gains of 0.17 and cost/QALY-gains at 8,800 pound sterling. The results were sensitive to assumptions about avoided length of hospital-stay and persistence of kyphoplasty-related QoL-benefits.
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the results indicate that BKP provides a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with hospitalised VCFs in a UK-setting.},

  abstract={Background: 
Type C3 thoracic fracture is a severe spinal injury, but one that is clinically rare, and there are few reports pertaining to the treatment of this type of fracture. No consensus has been achieved on the proper timing of spine fracture fixation; therefore, we focused on evaluating the surgical effects using a posterior approach and determining the influence of surgical timing on surgical outcomes.
Methods: 
This was a retrospective cohort study of 36 cases of type C3 thoracic fracture in patients admitted to the hospital from April 2005 to October 2012, and who were divided into two groups according to the timing of surgery: early fixation (<72 h) and late fixation (>72 h). Surgical outcomes were analyzed based on surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss, intensive care unit and hospital stay, mortality rate, and complications.
Results: 
There were 13 patients in the early fixation group and 23 patients in the late fixation group. Patients were treated with posterior decompression, intervertebral titanium mesh support, pedicle screw fixation, and fusion. All fractures involved a single segment: T7/T8 (8 patients), T9/T10 (11 patients), and T11/T12 (17 patients). All injuries were classified as American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade A. Patients underwent periodic follow-up over a period of 12-30 months (average, 22.5 months). One patient developed ascending myelitis and died of respiratory failure 1 month after early fixation, and two patients died of pulmonary infection after late fixation procedures. Other patients achieved bone fusion without improvement in ASIA grade. No statistically significant difference in parameters was observed between groups.
Conclusions: 
Though type C3 thoracic fracture is one of the most severe spinal injuries, complete reduction and recovery of spinal stability can be achieved using a posterior approach. As clinical outcomes in this study were similar between early and late fixation procedures, early surgical intervention may not be helpful for improving neurologic recovery in type C3 thoracic fractures.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Spinal tuberculosis occurring after percutaneous vertebral augmentation has rarely been described. To date, only two such cases have been documented in the literature. Vertebral augmentation may reactivate a quiescent tuberculous lesion and promote the infective process in elderly patients with or without immunosuppression, thereby resulting in poor outcomes.
Purpose: 
The purposes of this study were to present two cases in which spinal tuberculosis occurred after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, to highlight the clinical features and need for early diagnosis of this pathology, and to postulate probable reasons for this association.
Study design: 
This study is based on a clinical case series and literature review.
Methods: 
In this report, we review the clinical histories of two old women undergoing vertebral augmentation with subsequent spinal tuberculosis.
Results: 
The first patient responded favorably to conservative treatment with multidrug antitubercular therapy and spinal braces. The second patient underwent surgical debridement through a posterior approach alone, without instrumentation, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. By 1 year after treatment, both patients had experienced almost complete recovery and continued to be seen for follow-up visits.
Conclusions: 
Suspicion should be high, and magnetic resonance imaging is warranted in cases with deteriorating clinical symptoms and signs of acute infection after vertebral augmentation. We propose obtaining exhaustive microbiologic and histologic evidence via needle biopsy or open surgery in a timely fashion to establish an accurate diagnosis because tubercular spondylitis occurring in such a situation may progress rapidly.},

This case is unique in that the multi-resistant organism was isolated only after the second stage of infection treatment, which consisted of anterior débridement and anterior implantation of titanium cages and rods. In this particular case, infection was controlled despite implantation of multiple cages, screws and rods, and fusion was achieved, by means of intravenous antibiotic treatment for 12 months. At the latest follow-up, 24 months post surgery, there was no evidence of infection. This problem case may be helpful for surgeons confronted with spinal deformities secondary to infections with multi-resistant organisms.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures and cause persistent pain, kyphotic deformity, weight loss, depression, reduced quality of life, and even death. Current surgical approaches for the treatment of VCF include vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BK). The Kiva® VCF Treatment System (Kiva System) is a next-generation alternative surgical intervention in which a percutaneously introduced nitinol Osteo Coil guidewire is advanced through a deployment cannula and subsequently a PEEK Implant is implanted incrementally and fully coiled in the vertebral body. The Kiva System's effectiveness for the treatment of VCF has been evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial, the Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial (KAST). The Kiva System was non-inferior to BK with respect to pain reduction (70.8% vs. 71.8% in Visual Analogue Scale) and physical function restoration (38.1 % vs. 42.2% reduction in Oswestry Disability Index) while using less bone cement. The economic impact of the Kiva system has yet to be analyzed.
Objective: 
To analyze hospital resource use and costs of the Kiva System over 2 years for the treatment of VCF compared to BK.
Setting: 
A representative US hospital.
Study design: 
Economic analysis of the KAST randomized trial, focusing on hospital resource use and costs.
Methods: 
The analysis was conducted from a hospital perspective and utilized clinical data from KAST as well as unit-cost data from the published literature. The cost of initial VCF surgery, reoperation cost, device market cost, and other medical costs were compared between the Kiva System and BK. The relative risk reduction rate in adjacent-level fracture with Kiva [31.6% (95% CI: -22.5%, 61.9%)] demonstrated in KAST was used in this analysis.
Results: 
With 304 vertebral augmentation procedures performed in a representative U.S. hospital over 2 years, the Kiva System will produce a direct medical cost savings of $1,118 per patient and $280,876 per hospital. This cost saving with the Kiva System was attributable to 19 reduced adjacent-level fractures with the Kiva System.
Limitations: 
This study does not compare the Kiva System with VP or any other non-surgical procedures for the treatment of VCF.
Conclusion: 
This first-ever economic analysis of the KAST data showed that the Kiva System for vertebral augmentation is hospital resource and cost saving over BK in a hospital setting over 2 years. These savings are attributable to reduced risk of developing adjacent-level fractures with the Kiva System compared to BK.},

  abstract={Object: 
The aim of this study was to define the expected functional and health-related quality of life outcomes following common thoracolumbar injuries on the basis of consensus expert opinion and the best available literature. Patient expectations are primarily determined by the information provided by health care professionals, and these expectations have been shown to influence outcome in various medical and surgical conditions. This paper presents Part 2 of a multiphase study designed to investigate the impact of patient expectations on outcomes following spinal injury. Part 1 demonstrated substantial variability in the information surgeons are communicating to patients. Defining the expected outcomes following thoracolumbar injury would allow further analysis of this relationship and enable surgeons to more accurately and consistently inform patients.
Methods: 
Expert opinion was assembled by distributing questionnaires comprising 4 cases representative of common thoracolumbar injuries to members of the Spine Trauma Study Group (STSG). The 4 cases included a thoracolumbar junction burst fracture treated nonoperatively or with posterior transpedicular instrumentation, a low lumbar (L-4) burst fracture treated nonoperatively, and a thoracolumbar junction flexion-distraction injury managed with posterior fusion. For each case, 5 questions about expected outcomes were posed. The questions related to the proportion of patients who are pain free, the proportion who have regained full range of motion, and the patients' recreational activity restrictions and personal care and social life limitations, all at 1 year following injury, as well as the timing of return to work and length of hospital stay. Responses were analyzed and combined with the results of a systematic literature review on the same injuries to define the expected outcomes.
Results: 
The literature review identified 38 appropriate studies that met the preset inclusion criteria. Published data were available for all injuries, but not all outcomes were available for each type of injury. The survey was completed by 31 (57%) of 53 surgeons representing 24 trauma centers across North America (15), Europe (5), India (1), Mexico (1), Japan (1) and Israel (1). Consensus expert opinion supplemented the available literature and was used exclusively when published data were lacking. For example, 1 year following cast or brace treatment of a thoracolumbar burst fracture, the expected outcomes include a 40% chance of being pain free, a 70% chance of regaining pre-injury range of motion, and an expected ability to participate in high-impact exercise and contact sport with no or minimal limitation. Consensus expert opinion predicts reemployment within 4-6 months. The length of inpatient stay averages 4-5 days.
Conclusions: 
This synthesis of the best available literature and consensus opinion of surgeons with extensive clinical experience in spine trauma reflects the optimal methodology for determining functional prognosis after thoracolumbar trauma. By providing consistent, accurate information surgeons will help patients develop realistic expectations and potentially optimize outcomes.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A systematic review of the available medical literature from 1980 to 2010 was conducted and combined with expert opinion from a recent survey of experts regarding cervical spine fractures. Using an objective, hierarchical approach, the best available evidence is presented for health-related quality-of-life outcomes for these injuries.
Objective: 
To provide an evidence-based set of guidelines for cervical spine injuries in order to reduce variability in the information given to patients and their families.
Summary of background data: 
Patients' expectations regarding quality-of-life outcomes are highly dependent on the information provided by surgeons early in the treatment course. Our previous work has demonstrated that there is substantial variability in what surgeons tell patients regarding outcomes of cervical spine injuries, thus patients' expectations will differ and outcomes vary.
Methods: 
Four common cervical spine injuries (C1 burst, Hangman fracture, odontoid fracture, and unilateral facet fracture) treated both surgically and nonsurgically were considered. We assessed the evidence regarding 5 health-related quality-of-life outcomes: time to return to work, activity level, hospital stay, the proportion of patients who are pain free and patients who have regained full range of motion at 1 year after the injury.
Results: 
Published outcome data were available for most injuries. Using consensus expert opinion and the literature, answers to each question were achieved. Overall, expert opinion was relatively homogeneous across injury types, suggesting that experts do not distinguish between specific injuries when advising patients of expected outcomes such as pain.
Conclusion: 
By overcoming gaps in the literature with consensus expert opinion, our study provides surgeons and others with evidence-based medicine guidelines for patient-centered outcomes after cervical spine injury. This information can be presented to patients to frame expectations of typical outcomes during and after treatment to optimize patient care and quality of life.},

  abstract={Background: 
Type II odontoid fracture is a highly morbid injury among octogenarians, with 41% 1-year mortality. Our objective was to assess long-term fusion, complication, and survival rates.
Methods: 
Retrospective review of prospective trauma registry and blinded review of follow-up radiographs.
Results: 
Follow-up cohort included 94 nonoperative and 17 operative patients (median, 52 and 79 months). The operative group had significantly higher rates of repeated surgery for primary treatment failure or complication (1% vs. 18%; P = 0.01) and dysphagia, aspiration events, or tracheostomy (29% vs. 78%, P = 0.002; 6% vs. 30%, P = 0.04; 1% vs. 18%, P = 0.01). Three-year all-cause mortalities were 71% and 76%, respectively (P = 0.78). No delayed myelopathy was observed. One-year postinjury radiographs were available for 13 and 6 patients in the nonoperative and operative groups (P = 0.9); bony union was observed in 3 and 5 patients (23% vs. 83%; P = 0.04). Retrolisthesis greater than 2 mm was observed in 2 and 1 patients (15% vs. 17%; P = 1.0). Two patients in the operative group underwent repeated surgery for primary treatment failure. Dysphagia was diagnosed in 3 and 5 operative patients (23% vs. 83%; P = 0.04), whereas aspiration events occurred in 0 and 3 patients (0% vs. 50%; P = 0.02). Three-year mortalities in this cohort were 38% and 67% (P = 0.35).
Conclusions: 
Radiographic union is significantly associated with operative management, but the corresponding clinical benefit is unclear. Complications were significantly more common after surgery. Long-term survival in octogenarians following type II odontoid fracture is poor, independent of management. Frequent complications without a proven survival benefit suggest that most patients are better managed conservatively.},

Patients (n = 1822) with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma who had at least 1 site of bone involvement were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2012; follow-up concluded in April 2014.
Interventions: 
Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid administered intravenously every 4 weeks (n = 911) vs every 12 weeks (n = 911) for 2 years.
Main outcomes and measures: 
The primary end point was the proportion of patients having at least 1 skeletal-related event (defined as clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone) within 2 years after randomization and a between-group absolute difference of 7% as the noninferiority margin. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event by disease type, pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0-10; higher scores indicate worse pain), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse disability), incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, kidney dysfunction, skeletal morbidity rate (mean number of skeletal-related events per year), and, in a subset of 553 patients, suppression of bone turnover (assessed by C-terminal telopeptide levels).
Results: 
Among 1822 patients who were randomized (median age, 65 years; 980 [53.8%] women; 855 with breast cancer, 689 with prostate cancer, and 278 with multiple myeloma), 795 completed the study at 2 years. A total of 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the every 12-week dosing group experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event within 2 years of randomization (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to ∞]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. Pain scores, performance status scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical in both groups, but bone turnover was greater (C-terminal telopeptide levels were higher) among patients who received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks.
Conclusions and relevance: 
Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared with the standard dosing interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal events over 2 years. This longer interval may be an acceptable treatment option.

  abstract={The relative efficacy and harms of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) for treating vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are uncertain. We searched multiple electronic databases to March 2016 for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing BK with control treatment (nonsurgical management [NSM], percutaneous vertebroplasty [PV], KIVA VCF treatment system [Benvenue Medical, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA], vertebral body stenting, or other) in adults with VCF. Outcomes included back pain, back disability, quality of life, new VCF, and adverse events (AEs). One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and two rated risk of bias (ROB). Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using inverse-variance models. Risk ratios of new VCF and AE were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel models. Ten unique trials enrolled 1837 participants (age range, 61 to 76 years; 74% female), all rated as having high or uncertain ROB. Versus NSM, BK was associated with greater reductions in pain, back-related disability, and better quality of life (k = 1 trial) that appeared to lessen over time, but were less than minimally clinically important differences. Risk of new VCF at 3 and 12 months was not significantly different (k = 2 trials). Risk of any AE was increased at 1 month (RR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.21). There were no significant differences between BK and PV in back pain, back disability, quality of life, risk of new VCF, or any AE (k = 1 to 3 trials). Limitations included lack of a BK versus sham comparison, availability of only one RCT of BK versus NSM, and lack of study blinding. Individuals with painful VCF experienced symptomatic improvement compared with baseline with all interventions. The clinical importance of the greater improvements with BK versus NSM is unclear, may be due to placebo effect, and may not counterbalance short-term AE risks. Outcomes appeared similar between BK and other surgical interventions. Well-conducted randomized trials comparing BK with sham would help resolve remaining uncertainty about the relative benefits and harms of BK. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort study.
Objective: 
To identify risk factors for poor short-term outcomes after vertebral augmentation procedures.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebral compression fractures are the most common fractures of osteoporosis and are frequently treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. There is a shortage of information about risk factors for short-term, general health outcomes after vertebral augmentation in the literature.
Methods: 
Patients older than 65 years who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in 2011 and 2012 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patient characteristics were tested for association with 30-day adverse events, mortality, and readmission using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
Results: 
A total of 850 patients met inclusion criteria. The average age was 78.9±11.7 years (mean±standard deviation) and females made up 70.8% of the cohort. Of these patients, 9.5% had any adverse event (AAE), and 6.6% had a serious adverse event (SAE). Death occurred in 1.5% of patients, and 10.8% were readmitted within the first 30 postoperative days.On multivariate analysis, AAE and SAE were both significantly associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (AAE: odds ratio [OR]=2.7, P=0.013; SAE: OR=2.5, P=0.040) and inpatient status before procedure (AAE: OR=2.7, P<0.001, SAE: OR=2.4, P=0.003). Increased postoperative mortality rate was associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (OR=6.4, P=0.024) and the use of nongeneral anesthesia (OR=4.0, P=0.022). Readmission was associated with history of pulmonary disease (OR=2.0, P=0.005) and inpatient status before procedure (OR=1.9, P=0.005).
Conclusion: 
Adverse general health outcomes were relatively common, and the factors identified in the earlier text associated with patient outcomes after vertebral augmentation may be useful for preoperative discussions and counseling.

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
Summary of background data: 
PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture difficulty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture.
Methods: 
This prospective study included 316 patients with single-level lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle.
Results: 
Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fifty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were significantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had significantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically significant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignificant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more significantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and provide effective treatment for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, it also offered a higher degree of deformity correction and resulted in less complication than bilateral PKP.},

  abstract={The authors of this prospective, single-case study evaluated the potential for functional recovery from chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The patient was motor complete with minimal and transient sensory perception in the left hemibody. His condition was classified as C-2 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Grade A and he had experienced no substantial recovery in the first 5 years after traumatic SCI. Clinical experience and evidence from the scientific literature suggest that further recovery would not take place. When the study began in 1999, the patient was tetraplegic and unable to breathe without assisted ventilation; his condition classification persisted as C-2 ASIA Grade A. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe injury at the C-2 level that had left a central fluid-filled cyst surrounded by a narrow donutlike rim of white matter. Five years after the injury a program known as "activity-based recovery" was instituted. The hypothesis was that patterned neural activity might stimulate the central nervous system to become more functional, as it does during development. Over a 3-year period (5-8 years after injury), the patient's condition improved from ASIA Grade A to ASIA Grade C, an improvement of two ASIA grades. Motor scores improved from 0/100 to 20/100, and sensory scores rose from 5-7/112 to 58-77/112. Using electromyography, the authors documented voluntary control over important muscle groups, including the right hemidiaphragm (C3-5), extensor carpi radialis (C-6), and vastus medialis (L2-4). Reversal of osteoporosis and an increase in muscle mass was associated with this recovery. Moreover, spasticity decreased, the incidence of medical complications fell dramatically, and the incidence of infections and use of antibiotic medications was reduced by over 90%. These improvements occurred despite the fact that less than 25 mm2 of tissue (approximately 25%) of the outer cord (presumably white matter) had survived at the injury level. The primary novelty of this report is the demonstration that substantial recovery of function (two ASIA grades) is possible in a patient with severe C-2 ASIA Grade A injury, long after the initial SCI. Less severely injured (lower injury level, clinically incomplete lesions) individuals might achieve even more meaningful recovery. The role of patterned neural activity in regeneration and recovery of function after SCI therefore appears a fruitful area for future investigation.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
It has been shown that spinal fracture fixation within 3 days can reduce the incidence of pneumonia, length of stay, number of ventilator days, and hospital charges. Our institutional protocol calls for surgical stabilization of spinal fractures within 3 days of admission. We hypothesized that compliance with an early spinal fracture fixation protocol (within 3 days of admission) would improve non-neurologic outcome in patients with spinal fractures.
Methods: 
The trauma registry was queried for the period January 1988 through October 2001 to identify patients with spinal fractures requiring surgical stabilization. Patients were analyzed to determine the compliance with our protocol and to determine whether early spinal fixation can reduce the incidence of pneumonia, reduce length of stay, and reduce mortality.
Results: 
1,741 patients with spinal fractures were identified. 299 (17.2%) required surgical stabilization. 174 (58.2%) had surgical stabilization within 3 days while 125 (41.8%) had surgical stabilization greater than 3 days from admission. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to age (37.9 versus 42.5), admission GCS (14.1 versus 13.9), or ISS (22 versus 20.8). The incidence of pneumonia was similar in both groups (21.8 versus 25.6%). The mortality was higher in the early group as compared with the late group (6.9 versus 2.5%), although it did not reach statistical significance. The hospital length of stay was significantly shorter (14.3 versus 21.1) for patients who had early spine fixation, however there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regards to intensive care unit length of stay (7.2 versus 7.9) or number of ventilator days (5.02 versus 1.9). Patients who were severely injured (ISS > 25) also had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (19.6 versus 29.1) if they underwent early spinal fixation. Patients with thoracic spine injury and associated spinal cord injury had a significantly shorter HLOS (10.1 versus 30.5), ICULOS (2.3 versus 13.1), and lower incidence of pneumonia (6.5 versus 33.3%).
Conclusions: 
Reasonable compliance with an early spinal fracture fixation protocol produced some outcome improvements in non-neurologic outcome. Early spine stabilization reduced hospital length of stay in all patients. Patients with thoracic spine trauma and a spinal cord injury had the greatest benefit in reduction of morbidity, HLOS and ICULOS from early stabilization. There was a trend toward poorer outcome in some groups with early spine stabilization. A rigid protocol requiring early surgical spine stabilization in all patients does not appear justified. Although early spine stabilization should be performed whenever possible to reduce hospital length of stay, the timing of this procedure should be individualized to allow patients with the most severe physiologic derangements to be optimized preoperatively.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To compare safety and efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) when treating up to three vertebrae or more than three vertebrae per session.
Materials and methods: 
We prospectively compared two groups of patients with symptomatic vertebral fractures who had no significant response to conservative therapy. Pathologic substrate included osteoporosis (n = 77), metastasis (n = 24), multiple myeloma (n = 13), hemangioma (n = 15), and lymphoma (n = 1). Group A patients (n = 94) underwent PVP of up to three treated vertebrae (n = 188). Group B patients (n = 36) underwent PVP with more than three treated vertebrae per session (n = 220). Decreased pain and improved mobility were recorded the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery per clinical evaluation and the use of numeric visual scales (NVS): the Greek Brief Pain Inventory, a linear analogue self-assessment questionnaire, and a World Health Organization questionnaire.
Results: 
Group A presented with a mean pain score of 7.9 ± 1.1 NVS units before PVP, which decreased to 2.1 ± 1.6, 2.0 ± 1.5 and 2.0 ± 1.5 NVS units the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery, respectively. Group B presented with a mean pain score of 8.1 ± 1.3 NVS units before PVP, which decreased to 2.2 ± 1.3, 2.0 ± 1.5, and 2.1 ± 1.6 NVS units the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery, respectively. Overall pain decrease and mobility improvement throughout the follow-up period presented no statistical significance neither between the two groups nor between different underlying aetiology. Reported cement leakages presented no statistical significance between the two groups (p = 0.365).
Conclusion: 
PVP is an efficient and safe technique for symptomatic vertebral fractures independently of the vertebrae number treated per session.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Approximately 30% of patients with cancer receive bone metastases, of which 50% are in the spine. Approximately 20% present with unstable lesions requiring surgical intervention, followed by fractionated radiotherapy over 2-4 weeks to prevent early regrowth. Because of the limited survival time of patients with metastatic cancer, novel treatment concepts shortening the overall treatment time or hospitalization are desirable. In this study, we established a novel approach for intraoperative radiotherapy during kyphoplasty (Kypho-IORT), a method that combines stabilizing surgery and radiotherapy within one visit, after estimating the percentage of eligible patients for this treatment.
Methods and materials: 
To estimate the percentage of eligible patients, 53 planning CTs (897 vertebrae) of patients with spinal metastases were evaluated. The number of infiltrated vertebrae were counted and classified in groups eligible or not eligible for Kypho-IORT. The Kypho-IORT was performed in a donated body during a standard balloon kyphoplasty using the INTRABEAM system and specially designed applicators. A single dose of 10 Gy (in 10 mm) was delivered over 4 min to the vertebra. This was verified using two ionization chambers and a Monte Carlo simulation.
Results: 
The estimation of eligible patients resulted in 34% of the evaluated patients, and thus 34% of patients with instable spinal metastases are suitable for Kypho-IORT. This study shows also that, using the approach presented here, it is possible to perform an IORT during kyphoplasty with an additional 15 min operation time. The measurement in the donated body resulted in a maximum dose of 3.8 Gy in the spinal cord. However, the Monte Carlo depth dose simulation in bone tissue showed 68% less dose to the prescription depth.
Conclusion: 
We present for the first time a system using an x-ray source that can be used for single-dose IORT during kyphoplasty. The described Kypho-IORT can decrease the overall treatment time for up to 34% of patients who usually receive radiotherapy for spinal metastases.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Systematic literature review.
Objective: 
A systematic review was designed to answer 3 primary research questions: (1) What is the most useful classification system for surgical and nonsurgical decision-making with regard to thoracolumbar (TL) spine injuries? (2) For a TL burst fracture with incomplete neurologic deficit, what is the optimal surgical approach and stabilization technique? (3) Is complete disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex an indication for surgical intervention for TL burst fractures?
Summary of background data: 
Despite a long history of descriptive and clinical series, there remains considerable controversy and wide variation in the treatment of traumatic TL spine injuries.
Methods: 
A comprehensive search of the English literature was conducted using Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Standardized grading systems were used to assess the level of evidence and quality of articles impacting the research questions.
Results: 
Recommendations for the primary research questions were as follows: (1) Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System seems to be the best system available for therapeutic decision-making for TL spine injuries (strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low). (2) There is no specific surgical approach in the case of a TL burst fracture with incomplete neurologic deficit that has any advantage with regard to neurologic recovery (strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low). (3) Complete disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex as determined collectively by morphologic criteria using plain radiographs and computed tomography is an indication for surgical intervention in TL burst fractures (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low).
Conclusion: 
Based on this systematic review of the literature only very low to moderate quality studies could be identified to address clinical questions related to TL spine trauma. These findings suggest the need for further study, including emphasis on higher quality studies.},

Clinically based systematic review.
Objective: 
To define optimal clinical care for elderly patients with Type II and III odontoid fractures using a systematic review with expert opinion.
Summary of background data: 
Numerous manuscripts have been written about treatment strategies of odontoid fractures in the elderly. However, these articles are of low quality and optimal treatment algorithms do not exist.
Methods: 
Focused questions on the treatment of elderly patients with Type II and III odontoid fractures were refined by a panel of spine traumologists surgeons, consisting of fellowship trained neurologic and orthopedic surgeons. MeSH keywords were searched through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, and pertinent abstracts and manuscripts obtained. The quality of literature was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Using the GRADE evidence-based review system, the proposed questions were answered using the literature review and expert opinion. These treatment recommendations were then rated as either strong or weak based on the quality of evidence and clinical expertise.
Results: 
The literature searches revealed low and very low quality evidence with no prospective or randomized studies. The MEDLINE search engine returned 1759 articles, which were further limited to "all aged (65 and over)," human subjects and the English language. The subsequent search resulted in a return of 377 manuscripts. These abstracts where then reviewed in detail and 117 manuscripts were selected, which were obtained and supplemented with additional manuscripts to form an evidentiary table.
Conclusion: 
Odontoid fractures have a significant morbidity in the elderly (>65 years) population. Type II fractures in this population are recommended to be treated operatively with a weak recommendation, and if treated nonoperatively using a hard collar immobilization device. Type III odontoid fractures in the elderly optimal treatment with a strong recommendation is immobilization in a hard collar.},

Systematic review.
Objective: 
The objective of this systematic review was to identify the unique features associated with pediatric spinal cord injury (SCI) with the intention of determining the most effective spinal stabilization methods and identifying the optimum treatment for post-traumatic spinal deformity in pediatric patients with a SCI.
Summary of background data: 
Spinal injuries occur in 1.99/100,000 children, 10% are under 15 years, 60% to 80% occur in the cervical spine, and 5.4% to 34% in the thoracolumbar spine. The most frequent incident of spinal injury (50%-56%) occurs during motor vehicle accidents.
Methods: 
A systematic review of the English language literature explored articles published between 1950 and 2009. Electronic databases (Medline and Embase) and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify unique features of pediatric SCI based on 2 questions: (1) "What is the most effective means to achieve spinal stabilization in pediatric patients with a SCI?" and (2) "What is the most effective treatment of post-traumatic spinal deformities in pediatric patients with a SCI?" Three Spinal Trauma Study Group faculty members assessed the level of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria and disagreements were resolved by a modified Delphi consensus.
Results: 
No Level 1 or 2 evidence articles were discovered. Question 1 was addressed by 417 abstracts; from those 15 were selected for inclusion. This literature proved to be controversial, mostly focused on the adult population, pediatric series were retrospective, and most treatments were based on adult experience. The evidence supporting stabilization of the spine in the pediatric SCI population is very low for both the cervical and thoracic spinal regions. Question 2 was discussed in 517 abstracts; 8 relevant articles were selected. The principal key points, regarding the most effective treatment of post-traumatic spinal deformity in the pediatric SCI patients, suggest that the deformity should be prevented before the age of 10 to 12 years, younger SCI patients are unfavorable, nearly 100% of patients with SCI will develop a deformity, and brace treatment is generally recommended. Current evidence in support of brace use is very low.
Conclusion: 
Despite the lack of well-designed prospective studies to establish the efficacy of instrumentation in these cases, there remains very low evidence that supports the use of instrumentation in unstable pediatric spines to prevent neurologic injury and maintain spinal alignment. The very low evidence of benefits from early bracing clearly outweighs the risks and complications associated with its use. Close monitoring should be initiated early so as to delay surgical correction as late as possible. There is very low evidence to support the use of surgery for the treatment of deformity triggered by a SCI. There may be evidence suggesting that the correction techniques used for neuromuscular deformities are useful for SCI patients. In conclusion, there is a strong recommendation for the use of instrumentation in the unstable pediatric spinal injured population, and there is a strong recommendation for traditional neuromuscular spinal deformity treatment techniques to be adopted as a treatment of progressive spinal deformities after a neurologic injury.},

  abstract={Although over 300 articles have been published annually on vertebral augmentation in the last 5 years, there remains much debate about a fundamental question - is vertebral augmentation a safe and effective treatment to achieve analgesia, reduce disability, and improve quality of life in patients with a vertebral fracture? In this modern era of evidence-based clinical practice and public health care policy and funding, an evidentiary basis is needed to continue to perform vertebral augmentation. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the latest and highest quality evidence for efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness, and potential survival benefit after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The design, major inclusion criteria, primary outcome measures, relevant primary baseline characteristics, primary outcomes, relevant secondary outcomes, and limitations of prospective multicenter randomized sham-controlled and conservative management-controlled trials are summarized. Recently published meta-analyses or systematic reviews of efficacy that include these recent prospective studies of vertebral augmentation are examined. The highest quality procedural safety data relating to medical complications, cement leaks, and subsequent vertebral fracture are reviewed. Publications from national databases analyzing potential reduction in length of hospital stay and reduction in mortality after vertebral augmentation are presented. Finally, emerging literature assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of vertebral augmentation is considered. This narrative review will provide interventional pain physicians a summary of the latest and highest quality data published on vertebral augmentation. This will allow integration of the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient wishes to make the most appropriate evidence-based clinical decisions for patients with symptomatic vertebral fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
High-viscosity cement (HVC) has been gradually applied in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). Although HVC has been reported to reduce cement leakage, different opinions exist. To assess the complications of HVC in cement leakage in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures and to evaluate the clinical effect of HVC compared with low-viscosity cement (LVC).
Methods: 
EMBASE, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were comprehensively searched from their inception to August 2017. Two researchers independently searched for articles and reviewed all retrieved studies. Forest plots were used to illustrate the results. The Q-test and I statistic were employed to evaluate between-study heterogeneity. Potential publication bias was assessed by funnel plot.
Results: 
HVC reduced the occurrence of cement leakage (risk ratio (RR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29 to 0.51, P < 0.00001), especially in the disc space (RR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.80, P = 0.007) and the vein (RR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.85, P = 0.008) but not in the intraspinal space (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.19 to 1.23, P = 0.13) or the paravertebral area (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.22, P = 0.17). No significant differences in the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), injected cement volume or adjacent vertebral fracture were noted between HVC and LVC (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Compared with LVC, HVC results in a reduced incidence of cement leakage for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, especially in the disc space and vein but not in the intraspinal space or the paravertebral area. In addition, HVC yields the same satisfactory clinical effect as LVC.},

  abstract={Background: 
There are few comparative studies regarding kyphoplasty (KP) and vertebroplasty (VP) for the treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures (VCF) in patients with cancer. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively compare KP with VP in pain improvement, cement leakage incidence, and the cost of treatment of malignant VCF.
Methods: 
We performed a retrospective study of clinical data for 80 patients with multiple spinal metastases, treated with KP in 42 cases and VP in 38. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected pre-operatively, post-operatively, at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment. Cement leakage was identified using fluoroscopy and CT scan. Total cost per patient was also collected.
Results: 
There was a significant difference between the pre- and post-operative VAS scores (7.4 ± 2.0 to 3.8 ± 1.6, P < 0.001 in the KP group; 6.7 ± 2.4 to 3.7 ± 1.4, P < 0.001 in the VP group), and was maintained at 1-year follow-up (3.2 ± 1.4 in the KP group, 3.1 ± 1.3 in the VP group). However, the difference in VAS score between these two groups was insignificant at baseline and every follow-up assessment post-operatively (P > 0.05). The incidence of cement leakage in the KP group was lower than that of the VP group (16.9% (14/83) vs 30.3% (23/76), P < 0.05). However, none of the patients developed any symptoms. The length of postoperative hospital stay in the VP group was shorter than that of the KP group ((2.4 ± 1.3) vs (5.3 ± 1.9) days, P < 0.05). Total hospital cost in the KP group was much higher than that of the VP group (RMB Yuan 8 492 ± 3 332 vs RMB Yuan 3 173 ± 1 341, P < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
VP and KP are both effective in providing pain relief for patients with cancer-related VCF. KP provides no greater degree of pain improvement. KP is associated with a lower rate of cement leakage compared with VP. VP is associated with lower cost and shorter postoperative hospital stay in China.},

  abstract={Background: 
The role of spinal orthotic braces after surgical stabilization is not clearly defined. We systematically reviewed the published literature to determine patterns of practice, indications, and current evidence for the use of orthotic braces after surgical thoracolumbar fracture stabilization.
Methods: 
A search was performed for publications including descriptions of postoperative management and outcomes after surgical stabilization of thoracolumbar injuries. Differences between wearing versus not wearing a postoperative brace were examined with regard to loss of deformity correction, pain, return to previous work activity, functional improvement, instrumentation failure rate, pseudoarthrosis, and the percentage of reported complications.
Results: 
This search yielded 76 pertinent studies. Postoperative bracing (POB) was adopted in 62 studies for a median wear time of 13.3 weeks. No significant differences in terms of pain, return to work, Frankel score improvement, or instrumentation failure were found between the POB and non-POB groups. Loss of surgical kyphotic reduction was slightly greater in the POB group (4.79° vs. 3.77°; P < 0.001). The overall complication rate was also higher in the POB group (16.3% vs. 11.9%; P < 0.01). The pseudoarthrosis rate was lower in the braced group (2.4% vs. 6.0%; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
Most surgeons use braces for 3 months after surgical thoracolumbar fracture stabilization. Given the lack of clinical or biomechanical evidence for this, and the additional costs and potential discomfort to patients, further investigation is warranted to determine when and if POB for surgically stabilized thoracolumbar fractures is indicated. Controlled studies should include a careful analysis of pseudoarthrosis and complication rates.},

  abstract={Object: 
Anterior screw fixation of the Type II odontoid fracture stabilizes the odontoid without restricting the motion of the cervical spine. The metal screw may limit bone remodeling because of stress shielding (if not placed properly) and limit imaging of the fracture. The use of bioabsorbable screws can overcome such shortcomings of the metal screws. The purpose of this study was to compare the strength of a 5-mm bioabsorbable screw with single 4-mm metal and double 3.5-mm lag screw fixation for Type II fractures of the odontoid process.
Methods: 
Three different modalities of anterior screw fixation were used in 19 C-2 vertebrae. These fixation methods consisted of a single 5-mm cannulated bioabsorbable lag screw (Group A), a single 4-mm cannulated titanium lag screw (Group B), and two 3.5-mm cannulated titanium lag screws (Group C). Anteroposterior (AP) stiffness and rotational stiffness were evaluated in all constructs.
Results: 
There was no statistical difference among the ages of the cadavers in each group (p = 0.52). The AP bending stiffness in Groups A, B, and C was 117 ± 86, 66 ± 43, and 305 ± 130 Nm/mm, respectively. The AP bending stiffness in Group C was significantly higher than that in Groups A and B (p = 0.01 and p = 0.001, respectively). The difference in AP bending stiffness values of bioabsorbable and 4-mm metal screws was not statistically significant (p = 0.23). The rotational stiffness of the double 3.5-mm metal screws was significantly greater than that of the 5-mm bioabsorbable and the 4-mm titanium screws.
Conclusions: 
Double screw fixation with 3.5-mm screws provides the stiffest construct in Type II odontoid fractures. Bioabsorbable lag screws (5 mm) have the same AP bending and rotational stiffness as the single titanium lag screw (4 mm) in odontoid fractures.},

The complex approach aimed to creating optimal conditions for the functional regeneration of the spinal cord (SC), including neurosurgical methods restoring anatomical integrity of the organ and also multicomponent and staging rehabilitation of patients has been developed. On the base of complex approach during a postoperative period there has been put synchronous multifactorial action, consisting of functional multichannel electrical pacing of muscles simultaneously participating in tumble. The patient concentrates all his attention on the trial to tumble with paralized extremities by himself. At that the series and the site of application of these electrical impulses forms the algorithm of this tumble. Synchronism of produced afferent and efferent impulses creates new possibilities in activating of regenerating processes in the damaged area of the spinal cord. As a result of treatment within the bounds of the developed program the authors get clinically and electrophysiologically proved certain improvement that they can not only predict but guarantee patients of this group. Presented here results of the complex treatment of patients with trauma of the spinal cord within the framework of research international program confidently testify advantages of the new approach to solving of this problem. For the first time in history of medicine there is created close cooperation and regular continuity between molecular biology, neurosurgery and rehabilitation. This scientific alliance permits in proper time to keep a close watch, quickly correct and improve every stage of treatment. The effect of implement of innovations is been summarized at the each next stage of proposed complex treatment and eventually significantly elevates an ultimate result of medical rehabilitation of invalids with trauma of the spinal cord.},

Report of a patient with an epidural abscess after halo pin intracranial penetration at the site of a previous cranioplasty.
Objectives: 
To report a rare case of intracranial penetration at the site of a previous cranioplasty associated with epidural abscess, and to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to its management.
Summary of background data: 
The most serious complications associated with use of halo device occur when pins penetrate the inner table of the skull, resulting in cerebrospinal fluid leak and rarely in an intracranial abscess. However, no mention of intracranial halo pin penetration at the site of a previous cranioplasty was found in the literature.
Methods: 
A 64-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis had a halo vest placed for management of a fracture dislocation through the C5-C6 intervertebral disc space associated with left C6 radiculopathy. One week later, the patient experienced fever and headache associated with pain, redness, and drainage at the site of the insertion of the left posterior pin. Computed tomography of the brain showed a 1.5-cm intracranial penetration of the halo pin through a previous cranioplasty of the temporal bone, associated with epidural abscess and cerebral edema in the left temporoparietal lobe. The pins and the halo vest were removed, the pin site was cleaned, and a Philadelphia cervical collar was applied. Staphylococcus epidermidis grew on the culture of drainage from the pin site. The patient started immediate intravenous antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics for 2 additional weeks.
Results: 
The patient had gradual improvement of his symptoms within the first 48 hours. At the latest follow-up visit, he had fully recovered and his fracture had healed.
Conclusions: 
The halo device should not be used for patients with a previous cranioplasty, especially if the pins cannot be inserted at other safe areas of the skull. A thorough medical history and physical examination of the skull are important before the application of a halo device. Computed tomography of the skull may be necessary before elective halo application for patients with concomitant head trauma, confusion, or intoxication and for patients with a previous cranioplasty to ascertain the safest pin sites.},

Retrospective, multicenter cohort study.
Objective: 
Assess for differences in short- and long-term mortality between operative and nonoperative treatment for elderly patients with type II odontoid fractures.
Summary of background data: 
There is controversy regarding whether operative or nonoperative management is the best treatment for elderly patients with type II odontoid fractures.
Methods: 
This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients aged 65 years or older with type II odontoid fracture from 3 level I trauma centers from 2003-2009. Demographics, comorbidities, and treatment were abstracted from medical records. Mortality outcomes were obtained from medical records and a public database. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results: 
A total of 322 patients were included (mean age, 81.8 yr; range, 65.0-101.5 yr). Compared with patients treated nonoperatively (n = 157), patients treated operatively (n = 165) were slightly younger (80.4 vs. 83.2 yr, P = 0.0014), had a longer hospital (15.0 vs. 7.4 d, P < 0.001) and intensive care unit (1.5 vs. 1.1 d, P = 0.008) stay, and were more likely to receive a feeding tube (18% vs. 5%, P = 0.0003). Operative and nonoperative treatment groups had similar sex distribution (P = 0.94) and Charlson comorbidity index (P = 0.11). Within 30 days of presentation, 14% of patients died, and at maximal follow-up (average = 2.05 yr; range = 0 d-7.02 yr), 44% had died. On multivariate analysis, nonoperative treatment was associated with higher 30-day mortality (HR = 3.00, 95% CI = 1.51-5.94, P = 0.0017), after adjusting for age (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05-1.14; P < 0.0001), male sex (P = 0.69), and Charlson comorbidity index (P = 0.16). At maximal follow-up, there was a trend toward higher mortality associated with nonoperative treatment (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.97-1.89, P = 0.079), after adjusting for age (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05-1.10; P < 0.0001), male sex (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.10-2.16; P = 0.012), and Charlson comorbidity index (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.16-1.40; P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: 
Surgical treatment of type II odontoid fracture in this elderly population did not negatively impact survival, even after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The data suggest a significant 30-day survival advantage and a trend toward improved longer-term survival for operatively treated over nonoperatively treated patients.

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional review of 148 consecutive patients (87 male, 61 female) with spinal myeloma and analysed correlations between spinopelvic parameters and patient-reported outcome scores. The mean age of the patients was 65.5 years (37 to 91) and the mean number of vertebrae involved was 3.7 (1 to 15).
Results: 
The thoracolumbar region was most commonly affected (109 patients, 73.6%), and was the site of most posterior vertebral wall defects (47 patients, 31.8%). Poorer Oswestry Disability Index scores correlated with an increased sagittal vertical axis (p = 0.006), an increased number of VCFs (p = 0.035) and sternal involvement (p = 0.012). Poorer EuroQol visual analogue scale scores correlated with posterior vertebral wall defects in the thoracolumbar region (p = 0.012). The sagittal vertical axis increased with the number of fractures and kyphosis in the thoracolumbar (p = 0.009) and lumbar (p < 0.001) regions.
Conclusions: 
In MM, patients with VCFs have poorer clinical scores at presentation in the presence of sagittal imbalance. Outcome is particularly affected by multiple fractures in the thoracolumbar and lumbar regions and by failure to prevent kyphosis. Patients with MM should be screened for spinal lesions early.

  abstract={Background and objectives: 
Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a percutaneous treatment for cancer-related vertebral compression fractures (VCF). Posterior vertebral body wall (PVBW) involvement is considered a contraindication for BKP. This study assesses whether BKP is safe and effective for cancer-related VCFs involving the PVBW.
Methods: 
This study analyzed data on 158 patients with 228 cancer-related VCFs who underwent BKP. One hundred and twelve patients had VCFs with PVBW defects, and 46 had VCFs with no PVBW defect. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3 months.
Results: 
In the PVBW defect group, mean pain score decreased from 7.5 to 3.6 (P < 0.001), EQ5D increased from 0.39 to 0.48 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) decreased from 50 to 42. Cement leaks occurred in 31%. In the PVBW intact group, mean pain decreased from 7.3 to 3.3 (P < 0.001), EQ5D increased from 0.35 to 0.48 (P < 0.001), and ODI decreased from 53 to 50. Cement leaks occurred in 20%. No significant difference was observed in functional improvements between groups. Radiographically kyphotic angle and anterior and middle vertebral body heights were significantly worse in the PVBW defect group (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
BKP can alleviate pain and improve QoL and function in patients with cancer-related VCFs with PVBW defects with no appreciable increase in risk. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:835-842. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort study.
Objective: 
To examine the impact of early (<48 hr) versus late (≥48 hr) initiation of pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis on outcomes and complications among trauma patients undergoing operative fixation of spine fractures.
Summary of background data: 
VTE complications are associated with poor outcomes after trauma. Although pharmacological prophylaxis decreases the risk of VTE after trauma, concerns regarding bleeding-related complications among certain patient subgroups persist. At present, there are limited data regarding the safety of early VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients undergoing operative fixation of spine fractures.
Methods: 
We performed a 5-year retrospective analysis of our level 1 trauma center registry to identify consecutive patients undergoing operative fixation of spine fractures. Demographics, injury patterns and severity, details of operative procedures, timing of administration of VTE prophylaxis, and outcomes were analyzed. Patients receiving early VTE prophylaxis were compared with patients receiving late VTE prophylaxis. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of VTE.
Results: 
Of 1432 patients with spine fractures, 206 patients (14.4%) underwent operative fixation. Forty-eight (23.3%) received early VTE prophylaxis and 158 (76.7%) received late VTE prophylaxis. No patient developed an epidural hematoma or postoperative bleeding necessitating intervention in either group. Thirteen patients (6.2%) developed VTE, of which 12 occurred in the late VTE prophylaxis group. Age 45 years or more (odds ratio = 5.12, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-25.94, P = 0.048) and traumatic brain injury (odds ratio = 6.94, 95% confidence interval = 1.19-40.35, P = 0.031) were independently associated with an increased risk for VTE.
Conclusion: 
Pharmacological VTE prophylaxis initiated within 48 hours of operative fixation of traumatic spine fractures seems to be safe and is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding or neurological complications. Large, multicenter prospective studies are required to further define the efficacy and safety of an early pharmacological VTE prophylaxis strategy in this at-risk patient population.

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of important trials on the practice of neurosurgery.
Methods: 
We hypothesized that evidence from trials addressing the management of intracranial aneurysms (International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial [ISAT]) and nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhages (Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage [STICH]) and vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures had a significant impact on the frequency of the corresponding neurosurgical procedures. A Medicare administrative database was queried for corresponding Common Procedural Terminology codes and units billed per calendar year. The effects of ISAT and STICH were evaluated using a generalized linear model. The effect of the vertebral augmentation study was evaluated using a t test.
Results: 
After publication of ISAT in 2002, the rate of increase in proportion of cerebral aneurysms that were treated with embolization (Common Procedural Terminology code 61624) per year increased from 3.9% to 5.5% (P = 0.01). After publication of STICH in 2005, the number of craniotomies performed for intracerebral hematoma decreased from 2341 in 2002 to 1646 in 2011 (P = 0.03). After 2 publications in 2009, performance of vertebral augmentation decreased from a high of 99,961 in 2009 per year to 77,108 in 2013 (P = 0.002).
Conclusions: 
Randomized clinical trials remain the gold standard in the medical community to demonstrate efficacy, but their true impact relies on rapid and extensive assimilation into everyday medical practice. However, the described methodology establishes a temporal relationship only and does not prove causation. Nonetheless, trends in procedural volume suggest that the results of these select randomized clinical trials had a significant effect on neurosurgical practice affecting Medicare patients within an interval of a few years.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive procedure with cement augmentation of vertebral fractures. It was introduced in 1987 as a treatment for painful haemangiomas and is today mostly used for painful osteoporotic fractures of the spine. Two randomised, double-blinded trials published in 2009 have raised a debate about the efficiency of the PVP treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of PVP for vertebral body fractures in myeloma patients.
Methods: 
A consecutive group of patients with multiple myeloma who underwent PVP were reviewed. A total of 64 levels were treated on 17 patients during 24 sessions. All procedures were performed in local anaesthesia; no patients complained about discomfort during the procedure.
Results: 
The median preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 7.6. Improvement was observed in all patients. The median VAS pain score decreased to 3.2 at the three-month follow-up. The results are statistically significant. No complications were observed either during or after the treatment. We observed cement leakage in 12.5% of the patients, but no patients with cement leakage had clinical symptoms.
Conclusion: 
PVP is a safe and efficient procedure in the treatment of painful vertebral fractures in patients with multiple myeloma. The main advantages are the immediate stabilisation of the fractured vertebral body, reduction of the pain level and the fact that the patient can be discharged after two hours. The procedure can be repeated for several levels, and the pain relieving effect seems to be permanent.

  abstract={Pain induced by vertebral fracture in multiple myeloma can be treated by an osteoplastic procedure. The magnitude of the pain reduction by the procedure depends on the presence of additional causes for pain as spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis, stenosis of the spinal canal, or intervertebral nerve compression. To identify additional reasons for pain apart from a vertebral fracture-induced pain, a detailed preoperative analysis of the patients complaints is crucial for the outcome after an osteoplastic procedure. In addition, the technical aspects for performing the procedure and potential complications have to be considered as well as the stability of the cortical bone of the respective vertebral body. A complete collapse of the vertebra (vertebra plana) is an unfavorable situation for any osteoplastic procedure. In case of inflammatory or infectious vertebral lesions (e.g. spondylodiscitis) osteoplastic procedures are contraindicated. An interdisciplinary discussion of the individual case among oncologists, radiotherapists, trauma/spien surgeons, radiologists, and osteologists/endocrinologists is a prerequisite for the identification of patients who will truly benefit from an osteoplastic procedure and to avoid overtreatment of the patient and economical exploitation of healthcare providers.},

  abstract={Developed for benign conditions including osteoporotic fractures and haemangiomas, vertebroplasty has since been employed in neoplastic lesions, including myeloma. Advances in myeloma treatments, yielding improved survival times, have led to an increasing need for effective therapies that improve quality of life. The first randomised trials of vertebroplasty to treat painful osteoporotic crush fractures have cast doubt of its benefit over a placebo procedure, with a proposed rationale that fracture healing over time may account for the non-superiority of the results. However, these findings cannot be extrapolated to myeloma where the pathology is one of progressive bony destruction coupled with failure of new bone formation. In this paper, we present the outcome data for myeloma patients treated at our tertiary referral centre over a 5-year period, focusing on both subjective and objective measures of efficacy and safety. Records were reviewed to extract pain score, function and analgesia pre/post-procedure. Where possible, patients were then contacted directly and asked to assess their benefit by grading change in pain score, analgesia use and mobility. Performance status was assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale. Of the 26 patients treated for painful thoraco-lumbar lesions, 77% reported improved pain score (P < 0.003). Analgesia reduction, better mobility and improved performance status were also seen. Our data support the consideration of vertebroplasty as a first-line treatment for painful myelomatous vertebral disease. Prospective randomised studies are now required to further define its role.},

  abstract={Background: 
: Treatment of odontoid fractures remains controversial. There are conflicting data in the literature with regard to timing of operative fixation (OP), as well as whether OP should be performed. Within our own institution, treatment is variable depending largely on surgeon preference. This study was undertaken in an attempt to develop management consensus by examining outcomes in elderly patients with odontoid fractures and comparing OP to a nonoperative (non-OP) approach.
Methods: 
: The trauma registry of our level I trauma center was queried for elderly (age > or = 60) patients with odontoid fractures from January 2000 to May 2006. Patients were then grouped according to treatment, early-OP (< or =3 days posttrauma), late-OP (>3 days), or non-OP treatment. Patient characteristics that were evaluated and compared among the three groups included age, Injury Severity Score, preexisting conditions, and the type of odontoid fracture. Outcomes evaluated included in-hospital mortality, ventilator days, hospital length of stay (HLOS), need for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and the complications of urinary tract infection (UTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia. Differences among groups were tested using analysis of variance, Students t test, chi, and Fishers exact test.
Results: 
: The non-OP patients were significantly older than either operative group (mean, 82.4 for non-OP; 77.4 for early-OP; and 76.4 for late-OP; p = 0.006 non-OP compared with either operative group). Injury Severity Score, number of preexisting conditions, mechanism of injury, and distribution of type of odontoid fractures were similar among all three groups. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality among the three groups (11.7% early-OP, 8.7% late-OP, and 17.6% non-OP). There was also no difference among all three groups with respect for the need for tracheostomy and PEG and the development of UTI or pneumonia. However, there were significantly less DVTs in the non-OP group compared with the early-OP group (2.9% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.02). The percentage of patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility was similar among all three groups. The non-OP group had a significant decrease in both ventilator days and HLOS when compared with the operative groups. Only 2.9% of non-OP patients returned for OP for nonunion of the odontoid fracture.
Conclusions: 
: Despite being an older population, elderly patients with odontoid fracture who were managed non-OP had similar mortality, UTI, and pneumonia rates compared with their younger counterparts who underwent OP. The need for tracheostomy and PEG and discharge disposition was similar among all three groups. Elderly patients with odontoid fracture managed non-OP had a reduction in HLOS and ventilator days compared with either operative group and less DVT compared with the early operative group. Based on these results, non-OP management should be given strong consideration in elderly patients with traumatic odontoid fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
The purpose of this study was to assess proinflammatory markers in blunt trauma patients regarding the relationship of these and blood loss and duration of surgery in different fracture locations.
Design: 
Prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized cohort study.
Setting: 
Three level I trauma centers.
Patients: 
Sixty-eight blunt trauma patients, who did not require emergency operations and had sustained truncal or extremity fractures, were included. In two index patient groups, patients with spinal fractures (group SF, n = 24) and pelvic and acetabular fractures (group PAF, n = 21) underwent fixation of their fractures and were compared with a group of patients with isolated fractures (group FF, n = 28). Ten healthy volunteers served as controls.
Intervention: 
Internal fixation of pelvic, acetabular and spinal fractures, intramedullary nailing of femoral fractures, measurement of proinflammatory cytokines.
Main outcome measures: 
From serially sampled central venous blood, the perioperative concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were evaluated during a 24-hour period and set into relation with the duration of surgery and the degree of blood loss.
Results: 
Intramedullary instrumentation for isolated PAF caused a significant perioperative increase in the concentrations of IL-6 (preoperative: 16 pg/mL +/- 12 pg/mL, 7 hours: 89 pg/mL +/- 15 pg/mL, and 24 hours: 107 pg/mL +/- 27 pg/mL, p < 0.05). This increase was comparable with the isolated femoral fracture (group FF: IL-6 preoperative, 52 pg/mL +/- 12 pg/mL; 7 hours, 78 pg/mL +/- 14 pg/mL; and 24 hours, 120 pg/mL +/- 23 pg/mL, p = 0.02). The changes observed after spinal fracture fixations (group SF) were considerably lower (IL-6 preoperative: 11 pg/mL +/- 6 pg/mL, 7 hours: 16 pg/mL +/- 11 pg/mL, and 24 hours: 56 pg/mL +/- 19 pg/mL). The percent change of baseline IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations, and the blood loss in group PAF at 24 hours were positively correlated (IL-6 r = 0.72, p < 0.03, IL-8 0.67, p = 004) after insertion. No correlation with the duration of surgery was found.
Conclusions: 
The release of proinflammatory cytokines was higher in patients when their pelvic fractures were operated than in patients with spine fracture fixations, and was associated with the degree of blood loss. A higher increase in cytokine levels occurred when they were performed early (day 1-2) across all patient groups. The level of the released markers seems to be related to the magnitude of surgery, rather than to the duration of the procedure. This study supports the value of immunologic markers in determining subclinical changes during and after orthopedic surgical procedures.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Vertebral body compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis or malignant osteolysis are an increasingly common problem. The primary purpose of our study was to assess functional outcomes of kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic and osteolytic vertebral compression fractures. Our secondary purpose was to compare such functional outcomes in patients with osteoporosis versus multiple myeloma.
Methods: 
The 314 consecutive patients prospectively included in our study had progressive and painful compression fractures as a result of osteoporosis or multiple myeloma that were refractory to nonoperative modalities. Of those 314 patients, the 211 (67.2%) patients (155 with osteoporosis and 56 with multiple myeloma) who had complete preoperative and postoperative data formed our final study group. All patients tolerated the kyphoplasty procedure well (that is, there were no adverse events in terms of perioperative patient condition). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 235 weeks (mean 55.0 weeks). Functional outcomes were assessed by the SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index at baseline and at follow-up examinations. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test and the level of significance was set at P<or=0.05.
Results: 
The average Owestry Disability Index score decreased by 12.6 points (P<0.001) in the overall group, by 11.8 points (P<0.001) at short-term follow-up, and by 8.6 points (P<0.001) at long-term follow-up. All SF-36 sub-scores except for general health and role-emotional showed statistically significant improvement from baseline values at the same time points. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to functional outcome in the osteoporosis and multiple myeloma sub-groups.
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty provided a safe and effective treatment for pain and disability in patients with verterbral compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis and multiple myeloma. In addition, we found no statistically significant difference with regard to functional outcome between patients with osteoporosis and multiple myeloma.},

  abstract={In a prospective, randomized multicentre trial the safety and efficacy of two regimens of a low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin calcium) were compared for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in orthopaedic trauma patients. Two hundred and eighty-three patients with a spinal fracture, a pelvic fracture, or a lower limb injury were randomized to receive either a fixed dose (7500 anti-Xa IC units = 3075 anti-Xa IU) or a variable dose depending on body weight and time since operation (100 to 150 anti-Xa IC units/kg approximately equal to 40 to 60 anti-Xa IU/kg). The patients continued the prophylactic regimen for 6 weeks, but were withdrawn from the study medication in the presence of a major complication or if they were completely cured from their injury. To assess the rate of DVT, a B-mode ultrasound scan of both legs was performed. Positive results were confirmed by phlebography. If signs or symptoms of PE were present, a ventilation-perfusion scan was performed. Both prophylactic regimens were equally safe. In each group, five patients developed major haemorrhagic complications. In each group, one case of reversible thrombocytopenia was seen. DVT was confirmed by phlebography in one patient given the fixed dose and in four patients given the variable dose. PE was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion scans in one patient with the fixed dose and in two patients with the variable dose. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed on the overall randomized population, with the assumption that all patients who were lost to follow-up had DVT. A therapeutic efficacy analysis was performed on those patients, who completed the course of the prophylactic regimen and in whom B-mode ultrasound scanning was performed 10 days and also 6 weeks after injury. These two modes of analysis showed no significant differences in the incidence of DVT or PE between both prophylactic regimens. In conclusion, both regimens were equally safe following a spinal fracture, a pelvic fracture or a lower limb injury. The risk of DVT and PE was similar with both regimens.},

All patients underwent surgical treatment and were followed for an average of 27 months. All but one patient achieved solid radiographic fusion. Three treatment groups were studied: the first group of 16 patients underwent anterior decompression and fusion with instrumentation; the second group of 27 patients underwent posterior decompression and fusion; and the third group of six patients had combined anterior-posterior surgery. Prior to surgical intervention, these groups were compared and found to be similar in age, gender, level of injury, percentage of canal compromise, neurological function, and kyphosis. Patients treated with posterior surgery had a statistically significant diminution in operative time and blood loss and number of units transfused. There were no significant intergroup differences when considering postoperative kyphotic correction, neurological function, pain assessment, or the ability to return to work. Posterior surgery was found to be as effective as anterior or anterior-posterior surgery when treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Posterior surgery, however, takes the least time, causes the least blood loss, and is the least expensive of the three procedures.},

  abstract={The outcomes of traumatic two- and three-column lumbar burst fracture patients treated operatively and nonoperatively were investigated with respect to treatment complications, resumption of employment, and quality of life. Data were obtained from hospital records, radiographs, and written questionnaires. Of 93 patients diagnosed with lumbar fracture between January 1987 and December 1989, 22 met the criteria for study (12 operative, ten nonoperative). Exclusion was based on single-column compression or chance fractures, neurologic compromise, and nontraumatic fractures. The patient groups had distinctly different fracture patterns based on degree of anterior column compression (ACC). Trends toward significant differences in kyphotic angulation and canal compromise were noted. There were no preoperative complications. Varying modes of external immobilization were used in both groups. One patient in each group used narcotic medications for pain at final follow-up evaluation. When comparing the operatively and nonoperatively treated lumbar burst fracture patients in this study group, no significant difference in treatment outcome was established. Nonoperative treatment remains a viable alternative to operative intervention in selected lumbar burst fracture patterns.},

  abstract={A retrospective study was conducted in 179 consecutive patients (48 males, 131 females; mean age: 72.0 +/- 8.59 years; range: 51-93) with single symptomatic acute amyelic osteoporotic vertebral fracture presenting between September 2004 and September 2005 to the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, Italy. Vertebral fractures usually become manifest due to pain which can be debilitating. Treatment depends on the presence or absence of spinal cord involvement. In the first case, surgical stabilization is mandatory. In the second case, treatment may be performed either by conservative medical therapy (CMT) or percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty. After 2 weeks of analgesic therapy, 153 patients presented refractory pain and were offered treatment by PVT. A total of 58 patients accepted and underwent PVT (PVT group), while 95 refused and underwent conservative medical therapy (CMT group). Follow-up was performed by specialist consults, spine radiography and MRI and a self-assessment questionnaire evaluating pain using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and function using an ambulation and an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A 12-month follow-up was obtained in 86 of 95 (90.5%) CMT group patients and 54 of 58 (93.1%) PVT group patients. Significant reduction of VAS and improvement of ambulation and ADL was observed in both groups at 1 week and 3 and 12 months (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test), however, these results were significantly superior in the PVT group at 1 week and 3 months (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Average cost per patient at 1 week and 3 and 12 months were respectively 755.49 +/- 661.96, 3791.95 +/- 3341.97 and 4299.55 +/- 3211.53 euros (CMT group) and 3311.35 +/- 0.32, 3745.30 +/- 3.59 and 4101.05 +/- 755.41 euros (PVT group). PVT resulted significantly more cost-effective than CMT with regards to the three scales at 1 week (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). At 3 months PVT was more cost-effective than CMT with regards to the three scales, however, the difference was significant only with regards to ambulation. No significant differences in cost-effectiveness where found between the two groups at 12 months. PVT should be considered the treatment of first choice in symptomatic acute amyelic osteoporotic vertebral fractures with refractory pain after a short period of analgesic therapy.},

  abstract={Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine rank among the severest injuries of the human skeleton. Especially in younger patients they often result from high-energy accidents. Recently, a shift in paradigm towards more aggressive treatment strategies including anterior procedures could be observed. However, so far only few data exist reflecting the quality of life (QoL) after such injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate medium-term QoL and further to identify factors that influence the clinical outcome in patients with fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Data of 906 patients who were treated during a 10-year period in our institution were evaluated retrospectively. Only patients with single-level traumatic injuries aged between 18 and 65 years without neurological deficits, concomitant injuries of other locations and internal comorbidities were included into the investigation (n = 204). Three different treatment groups (i.e. non-operative, dorsal and dorsoventral stabilisation) were compared to healthy controls as well as different pain populations. The QoL was assessed using established questionnaires (SF-36, HFAQ, VAS-Spinescore, PRQ, and PTSD). Sixty-five percent of the included patients (n = 133) were studied at an average follow-up of 5.3 +/- 1.7 years after injury. All treatment groups revealed an identical gender and age distribution. More severe and unstable injuries were found in the surgical groups associated with higher treatment costs and a longer inability to work. Compared to healthy controls, QoL was compromised to the same extent in all groups. Furthermore, all patients treated in this study did significantly better than low back pain individuals with regard to QoL and pain regulation parameters. In our study, patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures showed a reduced QoL compared to healthy controls. Thus, patients do not seem to regain their former QoL. However, the level of discomfort was comparably low in all groups, even in patients with more severe injuries requiring extensive surgery. Overall, outcome and QoL after traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine rather seem to be determined by the severity of injury than by pain regulation or other psychosocial factors which is likely the case in low back pain disorders.},

  abstract={The outcome of 30 patients with combined spinal and pelvic fractures (C group) was retrospectively investigated and compared with matched group of similar number of isolated spinal fractures (S group) and isolated pelvic fractures (P Group), admitted to our institution between Jan 1998 and May 2002, following a high-energy trauma. After a mean follow-up of 57 months their outcomes were studied using EuroQol questionnaire and return to work status. The EQ-5D scores for patients in the S group were 0.71 (SD 0.29) compared to 0.60 (SD 0.14) for patients in the P group and 0.63 (SD 0.23) for patients in the C group. The EQ-VAS scores were similarly favourable towards patients in the S group. Seventy percent of patients in the S group returned to their previous level of employment after a mean duration of 5.3 months compared to 55% in the P group and 57% in the C group after a mean duration of 9.4 months and 12.8 months, respectively. Patients with isolated spinal fractures had an overall satisfactory outcome compared with patients in the other 2 groups. However, no difference was noted while analysing the outcomes in the later 2 groups (p<0.05), suggesting that the pelvic fracture contributes to the poor outcome, and the presence of a spinal fracture does not influence the long-term outcome. However, problems related to associated injuries and motor neurological deficits have profound confounding effect on the outcome in all 3 groups.},

  abstract={The optimal timing of percutaneous vertebroplasty as treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) is still unclear. With the position of vertebroplasty having been challenged by recent placebo-controlled studies, appropriate timing gains importance. We investigated the relationship between the onset of symptoms - the time from fracture - and the efficacy of vertebroplasty in 115 patients with 216 painful subacute or chronic OVCFs (mean time from fracture 6.0 months (sd 2.9)). These patients were followed prospectively in the first post-operative year to assess the level of back pain and by means of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We also investigated whether greater time from fracture resulted in a higher risk of complications or worse pre-operative condition, increased vertebral deformity or the development of nonunion of the fracture as demonstrated by the presence of an intravertebral cleft. It was found that there was an immediate and sustainable improvement in the level of back pain and HRQoL after vertebroplasty, which was independent of the time from fracture. Greater time from fracture was associated with neither worse pre-operative conditions nor increased vertebral deformity, nor with the presence of an intravertebral cleft. We conclude that vertebroplasty can be safely undertaken at an appropriate moment between two and 12 months following the onset of symptoms of an OVCF.},

  abstract={Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures affect more than 1 million patients worldwide each year. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedure that aims to stabilize fractured vertebral compression fractures rapidly and improve spinal deformity. The Fracture Reduction Evaluation (FREE) trial was the first randomized trial to compare balloon kyphoplasty against nonoperative management and it remains a landmark trial today. On the basis of this single trial, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons made a "weak" recommendation that "kyphoplasty is an option" for patients presenting with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Ongoing controversy remains about the effectiveness of this technique compared with placebo or sham surgery and other vertebral augmentation procedures. Economic analyses suggest that kyphoplasty is cost-effective, but complication rates and long-term outcomes remain poorly defined.},

  abstract={This is a prospective randomised study comparing the clinical and radiological outcomes of uni- and bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A total of 44 patients were randomised to undergo either uni- or bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. Self-reported clinical assessment using the Oswestry Disability Index, the Roland-Morris Disability questionnaire and a visual analogue score for pain was undertaken pre-operatively, and at three and twelve months post-operatively. The vertebral height and kyphotic angle were measured from pre- and post-operative radiographs. Total operating time and the incidence of cement leakage was recorded for each group. Both uni- and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups showed significant within-group improvements in all clinical outcomes at three months and twelve months after surgery. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in all clinical and radiological outcomes. Operating time was longer in the bipedicular group (p < 0.001). The incidence of cement leakage was not significantly different in the two groups (p = 0.09). A unipedicular technique yielded similar clinical and radiological outcomes as bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty, while reducing the length of the operation. We therefore encourage the use of a unipedicular approach as the preferred surgical technique for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Bone cement leakage during vertebroplasty is a frequently reported complication with the potential for neural injury.
Objective: 
To assess risk factors for epidural cement leakage during vertebroplasty.
Setting: 
Neurosurgical department of a scientific research institute.
Study design: 
This is a prospective cross-sectional randomized trial.
Methods: 
Seventy-five patients with intractable pain due to low energy vertebral compression fractures between T11 and L5 were treated with vertebroplasty at 150 vertebral levels. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were utilized to characterize vertebral parameters including the type of nutrient foramina in the posterior vertebral cortex. Following vertebroplasty, distance from the needle tracts to the midline and the presence and type of any epidural cement leakage were determined. Using logistic regression analysis, significant risk factors for cement leakage were determined.
Results: 
A smaller distance between the tip of the needle and the midline and a magistral type of venobasillar system were found to be significant risk factors for epidural cement leakage (P < 0.0001). Use of a bipedicular vs. monopedicular technique did not significantly affect the rate of epidural cement leakage (P = 0.3869).
Limitations: 
This study is limited because of the relatively small number of patients and the lack of any patients who had clinical consequences as a result of extensive epidural cement leakage.
Conclusion: 
The type of venobasillar system should be taken into account when planning a vertebroplasty procedure as a magistral type of venobasillar system is associated with the increased rate of epidural cement leakage. It is important to try and achieve a large distance between the needle tip and the midline, especially when a magistral type of venobasillar system is present, to reduce the risk of epidural cement leakage.},

  abstract={Buprenorphine is a partial mu receptor agonist and kappa/delta antagonist commonly used for the treatment of opioid dependence or as an analgesic. It has a long plasma half-life and a high binding affinity for opioid receptors. This affinity is so high, that the effects are not easily antagonized by competitive antagonists, such as naloxone. The high affinity also prevents binding of other opioids, at commonly used clinical doses, to receptor sites - preventing their analgesic and likely minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) reducing benefits. This case report contrasts the anesthetic requirements of a patient undergoing emergency cervical spine surgery while taking buprenorphine with anesthetic requirements of the same patient undergoing a similar procedure after weaning of buprenorphine. Use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring prevented use of paralytics and inhalational anesthetics during both cases, therefore total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was maintained with propofol and remifentanil infusions. During the initial surgery, intraoperative patient movement could not be controlled with very high doses of propofol and remifentanil. The patient stopped moving in response to surgical stimulation only after the addition of a ketamine. Buprenorphine-naloxone was discontinued postoperatively. Five days later the patient underwent a similar cervical spine surgery. She had drastically reduced anesthetic requirements during this case, suggesting buprenorphine's profound effect on anesthetic dosing. This case report elegantly illustrates that discontinuation of buprenorphine is likely warranted for patients who present for major spine surgery, which necessitates the avoidance of volatile anesthetic and paralytic agents. The addition of ketamine may be necessary in patients maintained on buprenorphine in order to ensure a motionless surgical field.},

  abstract={Object: 
Athletes present with back pain as a common symptom. Various sports involve repetitive hyperextension of the spine along with axial loading and appear to predispose athletes to the spinal pathology spondylolysis. Many athletes with acute back pain require nonsurgical treatment methods; however, persistent recurrent back pain may indicate degenerative disc disease or spondylolysis. Young athletes have a greater incidence of spondylolysis. Surgical solutions are many, and yet there are relatively few data in the literature on both the techniques and outcomes of spondylolytic repair in athletes. In this study, the authors undertook a review of the surgical techniques and outcomes in the treatment of symptomatic spondylolysis in athletes.
Methods: 
A systematic review of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases was performed using the following key words to identify articles published between 1950 and 2011: "spondylolysis," "pars fracture," "repair," "athlete," and/or "sport." Papers on both athletes and nonathletes were included in the review. Articles were read for data on methodology (retrospective vs prospective), type of treatment, number of patients, mean patient age, and mean follow-up.
Results: 
Eighteen articles were included in the review. Eighty-four athletes and 279 nonathletes with a mean age of 20 and 21 years, respectively, composed the population under review. Most of the fractures occurred at L-5 in both patient groups, specifically 96% and 92%, respectively. The average follow-up period was 26 months for athletes and 86 months for nonathletes. According to the modified Henderson criteria, 84% (71 of 84) of the athletes returned to their sports activities. The time intervals until their return ranged from 5 to 12 months.
Conclusions: 
For a young athlete with a symptomatic pars defect, any of the described techniques of repair would probably produce acceptable results. An appropriate preoperative workup is important. The ideal candidate is younger than 20 years with minimal or no listhesis and no degenerative changes of the disc. Limited participation in sports can be expected from 5 to 12 months postoperatively.},

  abstract={Vertebral fracture (VF) is the most common osteoporotic fracture and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Conservative treatment combining antalgic agents and rest is usually recommended for symptomatic VFs. The aim of this paper is to review the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) versus conservative treatment. VP and KP procedures are associated with an acceptable general safety. Although the case series investigating VP/KP have all shown an outstanding analgesic benefit, randomized controlled studies are rare and have yielded contradictory results. In several of these studies, a short-term analgesic benefit was observed, except in the prospective randomized sham-controlled studies. A long-term analgesic and functional benefit has rarely been noted. Several recent studies have shown that both VP and KP are associated with an increased risk of new VFs. These fractures are mostly VFs adjacent to the procedure, and they occur within a shorter time period than VFs in other locations. The main risk factors include the number of preexisting VFs, the number of VPs/KPs performed, age, decreased bone mineral density, and intradiscal cement leakage. It is therefore important to involve the patients to whom VP/KP is being proposed in the decision-making process. It is also essential to rapidly initiate a specific osteoporosis therapy when a VF occurs (ideally a bone anabolic treatment) so as to reduce the risk of fracture. Randomized controlled studies are necessary in order to better define the profile of patients who likely benefit the most from VP/KP.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To critically review and summarize the literature comparing the results of surgery via an anterior approach and that via a posterior approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures to identify the better approach.
Methods: 
In this meta-analysis, we conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and other databases using the search terms "thoracolumbar fractures", "anterior", "posterior", "controlled clinical trials". Relevant journals or conference proceedings were also searched manually. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the trials that met the selection criteria. Sensitivity analysis was performed when there was significant heterogeneity. Results were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95 % confidence interval.
Results: 
Four randomized clinical trials and three controlled clinical trials comparing the results of the anterior versus posterior approach in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrieved; these studies included 179 and 152 patients in the anterior and posterior approach groups, respectively. There were no differences in terms of neurological recovery, return to work, complications and Cobb angle between the two groups. The anterior approach was associated with longer operative time, greater blood loss and higher cost than the posterior approach.
Conclusions: 
The posterior approach may be more effective than the anterior approach. However, more high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to compare these approaches and guide clinical decision-making. Level of Evidence Level II, therapeutic study.

  abstract={Aim: 
The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding the classification systems and surgical management of thoracolumbar spine trauma.
Methods: 
A Pubmed search of "thoracolumbar", "spine", "fracture" was used on January 05, 2013. Exclusionary criteria included non-Human studies, case reports, and non-clinical papers. RESULTS. One thousand five hundred twenty manuscripts were initially returned for the combined search string; 150 were carefully reviewed, and 48 manuscripts were included in the review.
Discussion: 
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a high prevalence in North America. The thoracolumbar junction is a point of high kinetic energy transfer and often results in thoracolumbar fractures. New classification systems for thoracolumbar spine fractures are being developed in an attempt to standardize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as well as reporting in the literature. Earlier classifications such as the Denis "3-column model" emphasized anatomic divisions to guide surgical planning. More modern classification systems such as the Thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) emphasize initial neurologic status and structural integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex as a guide for surgical decision making and have demonstrated a high intra- and interobserver reliability. Other systems such as the Load-Sharing Classification aid as a useful tool in planning the extent of instrumentation and fusion.
Conclusion: 
There is still much controversy over the surgical management of various thoracolumbar fractures. Level I data exists supporting the nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic compromise. However, for the majority of fracture types in this region, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish standards of care.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
While frequently prescribed to patients following fixation for spine trauma, the utility of spinal orthoses during the post-operative period is poorly described in the literature. In this study, we calculated rates of reoperation and performed a decision analysis to determine the utility of bracing following pedicle screw fixation for thoracic and lumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Pubmed was searched for articles published between 2005 and 2015 for terms related to pedicle screw fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Additionally, a database of neurosurgical patients operated on within the authors institution was also used in the analysis. Incidences of significant adverse events (wound revision for either dehiscence or infection or re-operation for non-union or instability due to hardware failure) were determined. Pooled means and variances of reported parameters were obtained using a random-effects, inverse variance meta-analytic model for observational data. Utilities for surgical outcome and complications were assigned using previously published values.
Results: 
Of the 225 abstracts reviewed, 48 articles were included in the study, yielding a total of 1957 patients. After including patients from the institutional registry, together a total of 2081 patients were included in the final analysis, 1328 of whom were braced. Non-braced patients were older then braced patients, although this only approached significance (p=0.051). Braced patients had significantly lower rates of re-operation for non-union or clinically significant hardware failure (1.3% vs. 1.8%, p<0.001) although the groups had comparable rates of operative wound dehiscence and infection (p=1.000). These two approaches yielded comparable utility scores (p=0.120). Costs between braced and non-braced patients were comparable excluding the cost of the brace (p=0.256); hence, the added cost of the brace suggests that bracing post-operatively is not a cost effective measure.
Conclusions: 
Bracing following operative stabilization of thoracolumbar fracture does not significantly improve stability, nor does it increase wound complications. Moreover, our data suggests that post-operative bracing may not be a cost-effective measure.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Surgical treatment is an important strategy for the treatment of spinal tuberculosis (TB). Several approaches have been reported for the surgery. However, no single study has had a large enough sample population to definitively determine whether the single posterior approach is as effective and safe as the combined posterior and anterior approach for the treatment of spinal TB. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of posterior versus combined posterior and anterior approach for the treatment of spinal TB.
Methods: 
In this meta-analysis, electronic databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar, and Cochrane library, were searched to select the potentially relevant reports that compared the outcomes of the posterior approach (group A) with the combined posterior and anterior approach (group B) in the treatment of spinal TB. Relevant journals and references were also searched manually. Data extraction and quality assessment were according with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Outcome assessments were operation time, blood loss, correction of angle, loss of correction, hospital stay, fusion time of the grafting bone, neurological improvement, and complications after surgery. Results were expressed as odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence interval.
Results: 
Five controlled clinical trials published between 2012 and 2014, involving 253 patients (group A, 129; group B, 124) with spinal TB were retrieved in this study. The overall meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences (P< 0.01) between groups A and B in operation time, blood loss, hospital stay, and complications after surgery. However, no significant differences (P> 0.05) were observed in correction of angle, loss of correction at the final follow-up, fusion time of the grafting bone, and neurological improvement after surgery between groups A and B.
Conclusions: 
The posterior approach appeared to have the same clinical efficacy, but with less operation time, blood loss, hospital stay, and complications compared with the combined posterior and anterior approach in the treatment of sinal TB. However, more high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to compare these approaches and guide clinical decision-making.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the clinical and radiological efficacy of paraspinal muscle approach with winglike working channel in the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fracture.
Methods: 
From October 2010 to August 2012, a total of 51 patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures without neurological symptoms were enrolled in the study, including 32 males and 19 females. All patients were divided into two groups: 26 patients were treated through posterior paraspinal muscle approach with winglike working channel, and 25 patients were treated through traditional posterior approach. In all patients, the interval between injury and operation was less than two weeks; the vertebral canal blocked area was less than 1/3 in sagittal diameter; the compression of the fractured vertebra height was less than 2/3. And the patients with pathological fracture and severe osteoporosis were excluded. The perioperative index including operative blood loss, draining loss, operative time, postoperative bed time were recorded. The clinical results were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain preoperatively, at 3 days, 3 months, the last follow-up postoperatively and modified Macnab criteria at the last follow-up. The radiological results were evaluated by sagittal Cobb angle and the anterior height of the fractured vertebra. The data of two groups were compared statistically with paired and independent t test, χ² test, Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test.
Results: 
All patients were followed up with average of 16.6 months. In the two groups, the operative blood loss was respectively (91.5 ± 36.6) ml and (209.2 ± 38.3) ml (t=-11.216, P=0.000), draining loss was (13.7±4.4) ml and (162.3 ± 56.6) ml (t=-13.352, P=0.000), postoperative bed time was (87.3 ± 11.5) hours and (118.4 ± 20.4) hours (t=-6.727, P=0.000), VAS for back pain at 3 days postoperatively was 5.5 ± 1.0 and 6.4 ± 0.8 (t=-3.304, P=0.002), also VAS at the last follow-up was 1.0 (1.0) and 2.0 (1.0) (U=191.0, P=0.008). Data above showed significant differences between the two groups.No significant differences were found in operative time, (109.0 ± 29.7) min vs. (119.2 ± 26.8) min (t=-1.283, P=0.206), and modified Macnab criteria (χ²=0.513, P=0.774) between the two groups. The anterior height of the fractured vertebra preoperatively, at 1 week and the last follow-up postoperatively of the two groups were respectively (57.2 ± 11.8)% and (55.2 ± 10.9)% (t=0.685, P=0.496), (95.2 ± 8.3)% and (95.3 ± 5.8%) (t=-0.068, P=0.946), (92.9 ± 6.7)% and (92.1 ± 5.6)% (t=0.505, P=0.615). The sagittal Cobb angles preoperatively, at 1 week and the last follow-up postoperatively of the two groups were respectively 21.0° (12.5°) and 23.0° (12.0°) (U=316.0, P=0.544), 3.0° (5.5°) and 4.0° (4.5°) (U=342.5, P=0.893), 4.0° (5.5°) and 6.0° (6.0°) (U=328.5, P=0.701). There were no significant differences of these radiological results between the two groups in the same time point.
Conclusion: 
The paraspinal muscle approach with winglike working channel in the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fracture is an efficient surgical option which can acquire satisfactory clinical and radiological results.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Immunohistochemical analysis of type IX collagen in disc tissue from spinal fusion patients.
Objective: 
To determine if collagen IX can be detected in adult disc tissue removed at spinal fusion surgery from patients either with or without degeneration-associated tryptophan single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and whether the distribution is associated either with severity of degeneration or incidence of a collagen IX SNP genotype.
Summary of background data: 
Genetic factors are strongly associated with risk of development and/or progression of disc degeneration. Two SNPs that introduce tryptophan polymorphisms in COL9A2 and COL9A3 are independently linked to an increased risk of lumbar disc disease. Although tryptophan variants are associated with accelerated degeneration, it is not known if collagen IX can be detected in adult disc tissue.
Methods: 
We selected age-matched disc samples from five clinical groups: fracture with Trp(-) (six cases), herniation (six cases), degeneration (five cases), spondylolisthesis with Trp(-) (eight cases), and spondylolisthesis/herniation/fracture with Trp(+) (six cases of Trp3 allele and one case of Trp2 allele). Using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining (collagens IX and IIA), 78 sections from 32 patients were analyzed. Selected disc tissues were assayed biochemically for collagen IX.
Results: 
Focal deposition of collagen IX was observed in regions of adult human disc tissue from spines showing degenerative changes in patients whether or not they were positive for a tryptophan SNP. However, in nondegenerative control disc tissue from fracture cases, little or no collagen IX was detected. The latter finding was confirmed by direct biochemical analyses for collagen IX in pooled samples of normal adult human annulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus.
Conclusion: 
During growth and maturation of the disc, collagen IX is presumably removed completely during matrix remodeling so that the protein is absent from normal adult annulus and nucleus but can reappear at sites of degeneration presumably as part of a repair response to mechanical injury.},

  abstract={History and clinical findings: 
For about a year a 28-year-old Nigerian had been suffering from diffuse bone pain, intermittent fever, weight loss and weakness. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a swelling at the sternal angle.
Investigations: 
The tuberculin test was clearly positive and tests for inflammatory disease were elevated, but the chest radiograph was normal. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated multiple sites of increased storage in the ribs and vertebral column. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large paravertebral abscess, which was needled under computed tomography monitoring. Polymerase chain reaction of the aspirate demonstrated Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Treatment and course: 
While initial treatment with combined isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, the first two drugs had to be discontinued, the microorganism not being sensitive to them, and were replaced by ethambutol and amikacin. The abscess was drained and the vertebral fracture surgically stabilised. There were no neurological abnormalities and the lesions largely healed.
Conclusion: 
Even without pulmonary involvement tuberculosis must be included in the differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases with joint and vertebral column involvement, such as the SAPHO syndrome and other inflammatory bone diseases.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
For more than 30 years, minimally invasive surgical procedures have been available to stabilize the fractured vertebrae by cement augmentation leading to significant pain relief, a distinct improvement in quality of life and decreased mortality for patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. This overview article is designed to provide information on the wide range of augmentation methods previously tested and clinically applied in surgery in an attempt to compile the clinically relevant information on safety and efficacy in the published literature.
Method: 
Based on an extensive literature review on the topic of "vertebral fractures--surgical augmentation techniques" we summarized the results of published clinical trials and experimental testing which address clinically relevant questions. The selection of the publications in reference books and scientific journals covers the time period from the end of the 1970s until the present.
Results: 
The final selection of more than 50 publications with, in the opinion of the authors, clinically relevant data led to the following results, which can be of significance for clinical application. The prerequisites for the success of all augmentation methods include the earliest possible surgical intervention, optimal technical equipment and an experienced, interdisciplinary team, as well as thorough consideration of the situation of the individual patient. The selection of the material for vertebral augmentation depends on the surgical method. The material of choice remains polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and the best record of efficacy and safety is displayed by radiofrequency kyphoplasty with ultrahigh-viscosity cement. Regarding clinical efficacy and safety, there are many convincing documentations showing superiority of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in comparison with conservative therapeutic regimens. Initial results of clinical studies with additional implants indicate a trend toward further improvement in clinical success and suggest possible broader clinical possibilities of application.
Conclusion: 
Modern, minimally invasive augmentation techniques represent a real alternative to conservative treatment of patients with vertebral fractures. Further technical and clinical development in this area should aim at optimizing procedural safety while continuing to achieve comparably good results to current methods. Minimizing damage to the remaining trabecular structures as well as to adjacent vertebral disks and vertebrae should be paramount of importance.
Summary: 
Options for the treatment of vertebral fractures: Reductions in bone density and pathological changes in bone structure are associated with an elevated risk of fractures, which can lead to decisive functional impairment, pain, and a host of further comorbidities. Vertebral augmentation can be considered as an alternative conservative treatment, in order to achieve immediate and lasting pain relief as well as improvement in functional impairment. To achieve greater safety, instrumentation for transpedicular access and incorporation of radiopacifiers in PMMA for vertebroplasty were developed in mid-eighties. Balloon kyphoplasty was introduced in the end nineties, and results of prospective, randomized clinical studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy; the destruction of the remaining native spongiosa structures during balloon expansion is viewed as a disadvantage of this method. The two step method of cavity creation followed by cement delivery known as kyphoplasty has been further refined and developed by and varied by technology/procedural developments. This includes most the radiofrequency kyphoplasty (DFINE Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), in which ultrahigh-viscosity cement is delivered at a controlled delivery rate, following producing a bone sparing size and side specific cavity which minimizes loss of spongiosa, allowing for mechanical stability upon interdigitation of cement into that remaining trabecular bone. This combination has been shown to preserve vertebral structures and reduces the risk of leakages. Finally, systems have been available in which cement augmentation of implants to enhance mechanical stability of the implants or the overall fracture is constructed by load sharing.},

  abstract={Background: 
Standard open surgical management of thoracolumbar infection, trauma, and tumor is associated with significant morbidity. We compared perioperative and immediate postoperative morbidity of open and mini-open thoracolumbar corpectomy techniques including direct hospital costs.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all patients who underwent open or mini-open corpectomy. Demographics (age, sex, body mass index, primary diagnosis), operative data (length of surgery, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion), surgical level, preoperative and postoperative neurologic status (using American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale), immediate perioperative complications (within 30 days postoperatively), overall length of stay from admission, length of stay from surgery, and total direct hospital costs were tabulated and analyzed.
Results: 
The study included 43 patients, 20 (46.51%) undergoing open corpectomy and 23 (53.48%) undergoing mini-open corpectomy. Clinical and statistically significant findings in favor of mini-open corpectomy included lower estimated blood loss (1305 mL vs. 560 mL, P = 0.0072), less blood transfusion (241 mL vs. 667 mL, P = 0.029), shorter overall length of stay (7.2 days vs. 12.2 days, P = 0.047), and shorter surgery time (376 minutes vs. 295 minutes, P = 0.035) as well as lower total direct hospital cost ($34,373 vs. $45,376, P = 0.044). There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications between the 2 groups (medical complications 5% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.891; surgical complications 5% vs. 8.69%, P = 0.534).
Conclusions: 
Mini-open TL corpectomy is a safe, cost-effective, clinically effective, and less morbid alternative to standard open thoracotomy surgical techniques.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Operative treatment of vertebral fractures is focused on stabilization of the spine and decompression of the spinal cord and nerves. In German-speaking countries, it is common to restore the sagittal profile by fracture reduction. The use of percutaneous systems has been limited due to inferior reduction possibilities compared to open systems. The improved reduction options offered by newer percutaneous systems extend their application to highly deformed fractures.
Indications: 
Unstable thoracic, lumbar and lumbosacral spine fractures; unacceptable spinal deformities.
Contraindications: 
Need for open decompression or cross-bracing; relative contraindication: obesity or cachexia.
Surgical technique: 
3 cm skin incision 1.5 cm lateral to the radiological border of the pedicle. Incision of the fascia and blunt preparation to the facet joints. Guidewire placement via fluoroscopy. Tapping and cannulated screw setting. Insertion of the longitudinal rods and reduction using special reduction tools. Rod fixation with locking caps, wound closure, dressing.
Postoperative management: 
Pain-related mobilization, physiotherapy, indication for anterior fusion to be considered.
Results: 
In 2012, 80 patients (42 female, 38 male) with a mean age of 59.7 years received posterior stabilization (27 open, 53 percutaneous). Intraoperative radiation was significantly higher in the percutaneous group compared with the open group (percutaneous: 212 s; open: 146 s; p < 0.05), while the length of surgical treatment was significantly shorter (percutaneous: 107 min; open: 143 min; p < 0.05). Accuracy of screw positioning and the amount of reduction was similar in both groups. Major complications did not occur.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A center parallel cohort study with blinded inclusion based on clinical equipoise.
Objective: 
To compare outcomes of nonoperative and operative treatment strategies in terms of quality of life and neurologic and functional status.
Summary of background data: 
Despite a considerable body of literature, sound evidence regarding the optimal treatment for traumatic thoracic and lumbar spine fractures is lacking.
Methods: 
Medical records of patients hospitalized for traumatic spinal fractures between 1991 and 2002 were identified in 2 trauma centers in the same country with established and different treatment strategies. Eligibility was retrospectively assessed for each case by a panel of orthopaedic surgeons who were representative of the 2 medical centers, and who were blinded to the treatment actually administered. Patients were included in the study when there was disagreement on the suggested treatment method. Thus, 2 comparable groups were identified undergoing nonoperative or operative treatment. Outcome assessment and comparison across groups focused on quality of life, residual pain, neurologic recovery, and employment in the middle-long-term follow-up.
Results: 
Discordance in regards to choice of treatment was identified in 190 (95 treated nonoperative, 95 operative) of 636 potentially eligible patients. Patients were comparable regarding baseline characteristics, except for a somewhat higher proportion of males and neurologic impairment in the operative group. Seventeen percent of the nonoperative and 21% of the operative group developed complications and 3 patients displayed neurologic deterioration for which a treatment change was considered necessary. Follow-up was complete in 79%; mean follow-up time was 6.2 years with a minimum of 2 years. Pain scores, disability indexes, and general health outcome were comparable at follow-up. Compared with matched population norms, outcomes were poorer regardless of treatment method. Neurologic recovery was better in the operative group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that female gender and neurologic impairment were independent predictors of poor functional outcome. Eighty-eight and 83% of the nonoperatively and operatively treated patients were employed at some point after a rehabilitation period.
Conclusion: 
Overall outcome of nonoperative and operative treatment in middle-long-term follow up is comparable, although there seems to be a difference in neurologic recovery patterns. Studies on the cost-effectiveness of treatment options and the patterns of recovery within 2 years after injury would assist in guideline development and stimulate interest for future research.},

  abstract={OBJECT Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fracture. Bone density testing and medical treatment with bisphosphonates or parathormone are recommended for all patients with an osteoporotic fracture diagnosis. Inadequate testing and treatment of patients presenting with low-impact fractures have been reported in various specialties. Similar data are not available from academic neurosurgery groups. The authors assessed compliance with treatment and testing of osteoporosis in patients with vertebral compression fractures evaluated by the authors' academic neurosurgery service, and patient variable and health-systems factors associated with improved compliance. METHODS Data for patients who underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty for compression fractures was retrospectively collected. Diagnostic and medical interventions were tabulated. Pre-, intra-, and posthospital factors that had been theorized to affect the compliance of patients with osteoporosis-related therapies were tabulated and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Less than 50% of patients with kyphoplasty received such therapies. Age was not found to correlate with other variables. Referral from a specialist rather than a primary care physician was associated with a higher rate of bone density screening, as well as vitamin D and calcium therapy, but not bisphosphonate/parathormone therapy. Patients who underwent preoperative evaluation by their primary care physician were significantly more likely to receive bisphosphonates compared with those only evaluated by a hospitalist. Patients with unprovoked fractures were more likely to undergo multiple surgeries compared with those with minor trauma. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest poor compliance with current standard of care for medical therapies in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures undergoing kyphoplasty under the care of an academic neurosurgery service.},

Study the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments for osteoporosis.
Method: 
Review and qualitative analysis of the literature concerning the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments: physical exercise, rehabilitation aiming to prevent falls, spinal orthosis, and vertebro- and kyphoplasty.
Results: 
The level of evidence of the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatment is unequal on the basis of randomized study. The practice of physical exercise by the ambulatory elderly people and home rehabilitation for those who have previously fallen prevent the occurrence of falls. For institutionalized people, the prevention of falls is achieved by multidisciplinary programs. The use of hip protectors to prevent fracture is controversial. Physical exercises prevent bone loss after menopause and during postmenopausaul and corticosteroid osteoporosis. The effectiveness of mobilization after fracture is not documented. Only one study concerning the use of spinal orthosis after vertebral fracture reports interesting results for pain and disability. No randomized study concerning vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fracture is described.
Conclusion: 
The nonpharmacological treatments of osteoporosis are considered therapeutic means of key importance. They aim at the prevention of falls and bone loss and the reduction of disability after fracture. Only physical exercise and rehabilitation have been shown to be effective in preventing falls or bone loss. Their ability to reduce the incidence of fractures remains to be evaluated.},

  abstract={In men, vertebral fractures are poorly associated with bone density, and both cortical and trabecular micro-architectural changes could contribute to bone fragility. Bone histomorphometry makes it possible to investigate both the thickness and porosity of cortical bone, which has been reported to have a major impact on the biomechanical properties of bone. We therefore conducted a cross sectional study using iliac crest biopsies to investigate the trabecular and cortical bone structure in men with or without vertebral fractures. We selected 93 bone biopsies from men with idiopathic osteoporosis (defined as a T-score <-2.5), between 40 and 70 years of age. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence (n=46) or absence (n=47) of prevalent vertebral fracture (VFX). We measured micro-architectural indices in trabecular and cortical bone by histomorphometry at the iliac crest. Patients with VFX had lower trabecular bone volume (BV/TV: 12.4+/-3.8 versus 14.7+/-3.1 % (m+/-SD)), p<0.01), higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp: 871+/-279 versus 719+/-151 microm, p<0.01), and higher marrow star volume (V*(m.space): 1.617+/-1.257 versus 0.945+/-0.466 mm(3), p<0.01). Cortical thickness (Ct.Th) was the same in patients with or without VFX, whereas cortical porosity (Ct.Po) was higher in patients with VFX (6.5+/-2.6 versus 5.0+/-2.0 %, p<0.01), because their Haversian canals had higher mean areas (8291+/-4135 versus 5438+/-2809 microm(2), p<0.001). There was no correlation between any trabecular and cortical micro-architectural parameters. Using a logistic regression model, we evaluated the VFX as a function of the V*(m.space) and Ct.Po, adjusted for age. The odds-ratio of having a VFX was 3.89 (95% CI 1.19-12.7, p=0.02) for the third tertile of V*(m.space) (adjusted on age and Ct.Po), and 4.07 (95% CI 1.25-13.3, p=0.02) for the third tertile of Ct.Po (adjusted on age and V*(m.space)). Our data show that both trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture contribute independently to vertebral fractures in men with idiopathic osteoporosis. In contrast to data reported in women, in men it is cortical porosity, and not cortical width, that is associated with vertebral fractures. This suggests that the cortical deficit is different in men and in women with fragility fractures.},

  abstract={Iliac bone samples were obtained from 50 women with osteoarthrosis of the hip (50-80 years of age) during hip surgery for total hip joint replacement. After determining the resolution and threshold for the binary image, the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) data of the trabecular structure were obtained in these iliac bone samples using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Conventional histomorphometry was then performed. Both 2D and 3D parameters of the trabecular structure were significantly correlated with the parameters of conventional histomorphometry (r = 0.63-0.86 in 2D analysis, and r = 0.60-0.77 in 3D analysis). The patients were classified into the non-spinal-fracture group (n = 36) and the spinal fracture group (n = 14). There was no significant difference in patient age between the two groups. The parameter values of bone mass, such as 2D fractional trabecular bone area and 3D fractional bone volume, and the values of trabecular number (Tb.N) in terms of both 2D and 3D analyses were significantly smaller, and those of trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) were significantly higher in the spinal fracture group than in the non-spinal-fracture group. Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) values did not significantly differ between the two groups. There was no significant difference between 2D and 3D parameters in discriminating the spinal fracture group from the non-spinal-fracture group. However, 3D analysis demonstrated that the value of the bone surface to bone volume (BS/BV) ratio could discriminate between these two groups. These data demonstrated that micro-CT can evaluate the 3D structure of the human iliac bone, and that decreases in the parameters of the 3D-structure-related bone surface density as well as decreases in trabecular bone volume are related to osteoporotic fracture.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the fractured vertebra in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Thirty-two consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. All patients received percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, and they were randomly divided into two groups to undergo either the placement of pedicle screws into the fractured vertebra (fractured group) or not (control group). The operation time and intra-operative blood loss were recorded. Oswestry disability index (ODI) questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) as clinical assessments were quantified. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), and Cobb angle (CA).
Results: 
No significant difference was observed in the operation time and intra-operative blood loss between the two groups. Clinical results (VAS and ODI scores) showed no significant difference during all the follow-up periods. In the fractured group, there were better correction and less loss of AVBH and VBI compared with the control group. However, post-operative correction of the CA immediately after surgery and the correction loss at the final follow-up showed no significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous screw fixation combined with intermediate screws at the fractured vertebra could more effectively restore and maintain fractured vertebral height, and is an acceptable, minimally invasive surgical choice for patients with type A thoracolumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of three different surgical procedures in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Between September 2012 and January 2015, a total of 90 patients with type A thoracolumbar fractures were randomly assigned into three groups of 30 each. Patients in group A, B, and C were treated with three-level percutaneous fixation, two-level percutaneous fixation, and three-level open fixation, respectively. Blood loss, duration of surgery, VAS scores, Cobb angles, and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were collected for statistical analysis.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 17.7 months. Post-operative Cobb angles were significantly corrected and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were well restored in all three groups (p < 0.01). Back pain was efficiently relieved according to VAS score change (p < 0.01). There were significant differences in values of blood loss and post-operative VAS scores (at three months) between group A and group C (p < 0.01). No significant difference concerning post-operative anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae, Cobb angles and correction losses was observed between group A and group B (p = 0.580, 0.840, 0.215, respectively).
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous fixation not only provides the same reduction effect as open fixation, but also has an advantage of causing less operation related trauma which is beneficial to post-operative rehabilitation. The efficacy of three-level percutaneous fixation and two-level percutaneous fixation in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures is not significantly different.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
It is well known that during posterior stabilization of the spinal column conventionally open methods are predominantly used. However, in this study a minimally invasive method was chosen to decrease the morbidity of the operative access and to protect the paravertebral musculature, which serves as an important spine-stabilizing factor during posterior stabilization. The aims of this retrospective non-randomized case-control study were to compare the clinical and radiological results of minimally invasive on the one hand and conventionally open posterior surgery on the other with each other and to measure the loss of correction after purely posterior stabilization.
Methods: 
Twenty-one consecutive non-randomized patients with thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures, which had been stabilized posteriorly without any intervertebral body fusion between 1996 and 1997, and without any neurological symptoms, were examined retrospectively more than 5 years after trauma. Eleven patients had been treated conventionally open and 10 patients minimally invasive. As methods of evaluation, the intra- and postoperative amount of blood loss, the X-ray time, the Hannover-Spine-Score, the SF-36 Health Questionnaire and radiological assessment of the bisegmental wedge and vertebral body angle were made use of.
Results: 
The blood loss was significantly lower among those patients who had been operated in a minimally invasive way. The operating time, the time of X-ray exposure and the loss of correction were identical in both groups. The first year after implant removal, the loss of correction was the highest with 2.1 degrees for the body angle and 6.86 degrees for the bisegmental wedge angle. Neither in the Hannover-Spine-Score nor in the SF-36 Health Questionnaire did both groups show a difference. A correlation between the loss of correction and the clinical results could not be demonstrated.
Conclusion: 
The minimally invasive posterior stabilization leads to lower blood loss in comparison to the conventionally open method and can be carried out without any special effort limited to A-fractures without any neurological symptoms.},

  abstract={Background: 
This study compares the efficacy and safety of percutaneous placement of iliosacral screws between one and two C-arm fluoroscope groups.
Methods: 
This case series contains consecutive 18 unstable pelvic injuries, which were treated with percutaneous placement of iliosacral screws. A single orthopaedic surgeon (K.-T.P.) operated on all these patients. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the method of radiographic control. In group 1 (10 patients), iliosacral screws were introduced under the assistance of one C-arm fluoroscope. In group 2 (eight patients), percutaneous placements of iliosacral screws were performed under the control of two sets of fluoroscope.
Results: 
There were neither clinical complications nor malpositioned screws in both groups. The median time from initial preparation to completion of the first screw insertion was 45.0 and 16.0 minutes for groups 1 and 2, respectively; the radiation exposure was 5.7 and 4.5 minutes, respectively. The differences between groups were statistically significant (p<0.001).
Conclusions: 
The use of two sets of fluoroscope provides a speedier method with less radiation exposure for percutaneous placement of iliosacral screws than the use of one set.},

  abstract={Background: 
Kyphoplasty reduces the pain caused by osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). Although the procedure is typically carried out using a bilateral approach, it is now increasingly performed using a unilateral approach because of the concern for long-term adverse effects. However, little evidence is available to demonstrate superior safety of the unilateral approach.
Objective: 
The purpose of this study was to compare the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of unilateral vs. bilateral kyphoplasty.
Study design: 
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Settings: 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and abstracts published in the related orthopedic journals were systematically searched up to September 2012, using "unilateral kyphoplasty" and "osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures" as key words.
Methods: 
Two investigators independently searched and identified relevant reports and abstracts using the PRISMA statement criteria. Relevant studies cited by the identified papers were also included. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited (or poor) based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
Results: 
Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 159 cases were enrolled. The methodological quality of the articles was determined as moderate. We did not find any significant difference between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty on pain relief, in either short-term or long-term follow-up (P = 0.65 and P = 0.69, respectively). The rate of adjacent vertebral fracture was not statistically different with a P value of 0.88 and 95% CI (confidence intervals) of 0.25-3.26. Cement leakage was comparable between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty (P = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46-4.26). The loss of vertebral height in long-term follow-up was not different (P = 0.10, 95% CI = -0.39-4.54). Operation time and cement dosage were considerably less for unilateral kyphoplasty (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively).
Limitations: 
Only 4 RCTs and 159 patients were included in this systematic review. Publication bias also existed among the studies included.
Conclusions: 
Both unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty are effective in alleviating the back pain caused by OVCF. Two approaches have the same degree of safety. More RCTs are needed to examine the efficacy and adverse reactions of the 2 approaches.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To determine if differences in safety or efficacy exist between balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), vertebroplasty (VP) and non-surgical management (NSM) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).
Methods: 
As of February 1, 2011, a PubMed search (key words: kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty) resulted in 1,587 articles out of which 27 met basic selection criteria (prospective multiple-arm studies with cohorts of ≥ 20 patients). This systematic review adheres to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Results: 
Pain reduction in both BKP (-5.07/10 points, P < 0.01) and VP (-4.55/10, P < 0.01) was superior to that for NSM (-2.17/10), while no difference was found between BKP/VP (P = 0.35). Subsequent fractures occurred more frequently in the NSM group (22 %) compared with VP (11 %, P = 0.04) and BKP (11 %, P = 0.01). BKP resulted in greater kyphosis reduction than VP (4.8º vs. 1.7°, P < 0.01). Quality of life (QOL) improvement showed superiority of BKP over VP (P = 0.04), along with a trend for disability improvement (P = 0.08). Cement extravasation was less frequent in the BKP (P = 0.01). Surgical intervention within the first 7 weeks yielded greater pain reduction than VCFs treated later.
Conclusions: 
BKP/VP provided greater pain relief and fewer subsequent fractures than NSM in osteoporotic VCFs. BKP is marginally favored over VP in disability improvement, and significantly favored in QOL improvement. BKP had a lower risk of cement extravasation and resulted in greater kyphosis correction. Despite this analysis being restricted to Level I and II studies, significant heterogeneity suggests that the current literature is delivering inconsistent messages and further trials are needed to delineate confounding variables.},

  abstract={We report on a case of a 65-year-old (CD) woman who sustained an atraumatic neck fracture. A combination of Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations, chronic cervical dystonia and osteoporosis provided the basis for this interesting diagnosis. Mrs CD had progressed to complex phase idiopathic Parkinson's disease within 13 years of diagnosis. During this time she remained independent, only using a wheelchair when her motor fluctuations were bad. In 2011, she developed a sudden onset of neck spasm and occipital neuralgia, initially attributed to severe spasmodic cervical dystonia. Despite a titration regime of analgesics and weaning off of her Parkinson's disease medications, the pain persisted. An X-ray of her cervical spine showed degenerative discopathies from C4 to C7. Mrs CD underwent a trial of Botox injections to no avail and she was admitted acutely under the spinal team after an MRI of her spine showed abnormal oedema of the odontoid peg. Subsequent CT diagnosed a type II fracture of the odontoid peg on the background of severe osteoporotic bone (spinal T score -3.4 on subsequent DEXA scan) and she underwent a successful occipital cervical fusion of C1-C6. What makes this case interesting is the fact that this lady's profound powerful neck movements on a background of osteoporosis led to fracture of her neck. Post-operatively, she admitted to non-adherence to her bisphosphonates, prioritising levodopa in the morning with food rather than taking her alendronate on an empty stomach. She is now pain free and receives annual zolendronate infusions.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) commonly cause both acute and chronic back pain, substantial spinal deformity, functional disability and decreased quality of life and increase the risk of future vertebral fractures and mortality. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), balloon kyphoplasty (BK) and non-surgical treatment (NST) are mostly used for the treatment of OVCFs. However, which treatment is preferred is unknown. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the literature and ascertain the relative efficacy and safety of BK, PVP and NST for patients with OVCFs using a Bayesian network meta-analysis.
Methods and analysis: 
We will comprehensively search PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, to include randomided controlled trials that compare BK, PVP or NST for treating OVCFs. The risk of bias for individual studies will be assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed to compare the efficacy and safety of BK, PVP and NST. The quality of evidence will be evaluated by GRADE.
Ethics and dissemination: 
Ethical approval and patient consent are not required since this study is a meta-analysis based on published studies. The results of this network meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

  abstract={Background and purpose - Randomized trials have found that treating spinal burst fractures with reduction and posterior fixation is adequate without the use of bone grafting for definitive fusion. Restitution of intervertebral mobility of such an unfused segment after fracture healing may unload the adjacent parts of the spine and reduce the risk of degeneration of these segments. We used radiostereometry (RSA) to study whether late implant removal would restore the intervertebral mobility of a thoracolumbar segment treated with posterior instrumentation but no bone grafting for unstable spinal fracture. Patients and methods - We identified 7 patients with implant-related back pain at least 1.5 years after a thoracolumbar fracture (Th12 or L1) treated with reduction and posterior instrumentation. The implants were removed and tantalum indicators for RSA were inserted. 3 months later, each patient was examined with RSA. The intervertebral translations and rotations of the thoracolumbar segment, induced by change in position from flexion to extension, were measured. Progressive deformity was registered by conventional radiography and the overall clinical outcome was assessed by the patients. Results - According to RSA, all 7 patients regained some mobility of the fractured thoracolumbar segment. In 1 patient who was primarily treated for a flexion-distraction type of injury, conventional radiography revealed a progressive kyphotic deformity 3 months after implant removal and the clinical outcome was poor. According to the patients, 1 had a fair clinical outcome and 5 had good outcome. Interpretation - Late implant removal may restore segmental mobility after posterior fracture fixation of the thoracolumbar segment if bone grafting has not been used. The clinical consequences, positive or negative, of the residual mobility demonstrated in our small number of patients should be evaluated in studies based on extended patient series and with different fracture types.},

  abstract={Aim: 
To evaluate the treatment strategy for pathological fractures caused by vertebral hemangiomas (VHs) using large case series.
Methods: 
From January 2008 to January 2014, 28 patients suffering from severe pathological fractures (more than 2/3 loss of original vertebral height) due to thoracic or lumbar VHs were randomized to an experimental (the posterior decompression, bone cement augmentation and internal fixation, n=14) or control (only the posterior decompression combined with internal fixation, n=14) group. The anterior, middle vertebral body height, kyphosis angle and the cement leakage were measured on radiography. Visual analogue scale (VAS), 36-item short form (SF-36) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were recorded to assess the pain relief, life quality and function improvement.
Results: 
Compared with the preoperation, the anterior, middle vertebral body height and kyphosis angle were significantly improved after two procedures, but the improvement efficacy seemed to be more significant in the experimental group, with no significant loss of correction effect at final follow-up. The VAS, SF-36 and ODI scores were all significantly improved postoperatively, especially at final follow-up in two groups. The neurological situation was improved in patients at least 1 grade in Frankel scale. After mean follow-up of 24 months, no operative complications (internal fixation loosening, breakage, spinal nerve damage or pneumothorax) were observed, except bone cement leakage occurred in two cases in experimental group.
Conclusion: 
Posterior decompression, bone cement augmentation and internal fixation seems to be effective and safe for pathological fractures caused by VHs, with better outcomes and few complications.},

  abstract={Traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine are common causes of spine surgery. Pedicle screw fixation is usually chosen, using monosegmentar, short or long segment instrumentations, with or without bone graft. This review aims to evaluate the effect of transpedicular fixation in traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. A systematic search on controlled, randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing different methods of surgical treatment of this fractures was performed, followed by a process of article selection, data extraction and bias assessment by 3 independent authors. Eight articles were included in a total of 5 comparisons, between different transpedicular fixation techniques. No significant differences on function or quality of life, neurologic status or limitation of motion were found. Only instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation showed significant decrease of pain when compared with instrumentation alone. Several techniques resulted in significant improvements of different radiological parameters. Significantly, surgeries with smaller duration were associated with lesser blood loss. Bone graft use caused a significant raise in post-operative complications, namely donor site pain. So, this paper showed that significative improvements in radiological parameters do not associate with correspondent clinical benefits, and only instrumentation with level screw incorporation is associated with a clear benefit on pain. Moreover, the need for bone graft is questioned, since it leads to no clinic-radiological improvement with a raise of complications. However, a small number of controlled studies is available on this topic.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) could give rise to excellent outcomes and significant improvements in pain, analgesic requirements, function, cost, and incidence of serious complications for thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). But some studies showed the recurrent fracture of a previously operated vertebra or adjacent vertebral fracture after PVP or PKP. The purpose of this study was to compare minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation (MIPS) and PVP with PVP to evaluate its feasibility and safety for treating acute thoracolumbar osteoporotic VCF and preventing the secondary VCF after PVP.
Methods: 
Sixty-eight patients with a mean age of 74.5 years (ranging 65 ~ 87 years), who sustained thoracic or lumbar fresh osteoporotic VCFs without neurologic deficits underwent the procedure of PVP (group 1, n = 37) or MIPS combined with PVP (group 2, n = 31). Visual analog scale pain scores (VAS) were recorded and Cobb angles, central and anterior vertebral body height were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery.
Results: 
The patients were followed for an average of 27 months (ranging 24-32 months). The VAS significantly decreased after surgery in both groups (P < 0.005). The central and anterior vertebral body height significantly increased (P < 0.005), and the Cobb angle significantly decreased (P < 0.05) immediately after surgery in both groups. No significant changes in both the Cobb angle correction and the vertebral body height gains obtained were observed at the end of the follow-up period in group 2. But the Cobb angle significantly increased (P < 0.005), and the central and anterior vertebral body height significantly decreased (P < 0.005) 2 years after surgery compared with those immediately after surgery in group 1, and there were five patients with new fracture of operated vertebrae and nine cases with fracture of adjacent vertebrae.
Conclusions: 
MIPS combined with PVP is a good choice for the treatment of acute thoracolumbar osteoporotic VCF, which can prevent secondary VCF after PVP.},

  abstract={A total of 112 patients with a single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture who did not respond to conservative therapy were included and allocated to either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty treatment. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to assess back pain and disability. Anterior, midline, posterior vertebral body heights, and kyphotic angle at the fractured vertebra were measured for radiographic evaluation. Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations were performed postoperatively at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Complications and patient satisfaction with the surgical procedure were also recorded. The follow-up rate was 73.3% in the kyphoplasty group and 80.8% in the vertebroplasty group (P = 0.737). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to improvement in VAS and ODI scores (P > 0.05) at all postoperative intervals. Both treatment groups achieved marked vertebral height restoration and kyphotic angle reduction, but the radiographic parameters were signiﬁcantly better in the kyphoplasty group (P < 0.05). The incidence of asymptomatic cement leakage per treated vertebrae in the kyphoplasty group was 11.4% versus 31% in the vertebroplasty group (P < 0.001). Three adjacent level fractures in the kyphoplasty group and 2 in the vertebroplasty group occurred during 2-year follow-up, and no difference in patient satisfaction was detected between the 2 groups. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty achieved similar improvement of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction at 2 years after surgery, albeit kyphoplasty had more ability to markedly reduce vertebral deformity and resulted in less cement leaks compared with vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical effect of thoracolumbar fractures between single-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the gap of paravertebral muscles and double-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the stripping of paravertebral muscles.
Methods: 
From September 2008 to January 2010, 65 patients with incomplete compressed thoracolumbar fractures or burst thoracolumbar fractures with unilateral endplate injury were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty patients were treated with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paravertebral muscles (treatment group). Thirty-five patients were treated with double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of the paravertebral muscles (control group). All the internal fixations were taken out during 10-12 months after operation. Operative time, perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume were compared between two groups. At final follow-up, the change of neurological ASIA grade were recorded; and postoperative 5 days and final follow-up, compared Denis classification of lumbar and back pain between two groups; and analyzed the sagittal index and compressibility of anterior border of vertebral body by X -ray lateral projection.
Results: 
All patients were follow-up from 14 to 22 months with an average of 18.3 months. No postoperative infection, secondary spinal cord injury was found. One case of control group occurred internal fixation breakage at the 11th month after operation and other internal fixation no loosening. There was no significant difference in operative time, the recovery of neurological function between the two groups (P > 0.05). Perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume of treatment group was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). And in Denis classification of lumbar and back pain, the treatment group recovered more quickly, and the residual pain of lumbar and back was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). Postoperative posterior salient and compression of anterior border of vertebral body improved in two groups (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in degree of improvement between two groups (P > 0.05); but both loss existed at final follow-up (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in loss of posterior salient between two groups (P > 0.05). In the treatment group, the loss of rectify of anterior border of vertebral body existed, but it was less than that of the control group.
Conclusion: 
In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications, the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paraspinal muscles, can effectively recover the height of vertebral body and rectify posterior salient, and reduce the fixed segment. Compared with the traditional operative method of double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of paraspinal muscle, it can obviously reduce the operation wound and the bleeding, lessen the pain of lumbar and back. And the recent clinical effect is satisfied.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical effects of indirect decompression versus open decompression to vertebral canal in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit.
Methods: 
From April 2004 to June 2008, 52 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit underwent posterior exposition, reduction and fixation with Atlas Fixator (AF) instrumentation. There were 34 males and 18 females with an average age of 43.1 years (range, 31-63 years). The affected locations were T11 in 5 cases, T12 in 24 cases, L1 in 16 cases, and L2 in 7 cases. The time from injury to operation was 3-8 days (4.4 days on average). All cases were divided into indirect decompression group (group A) and open decompression group (group B). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in sex, age, affect site, and disease course between two groups. The operative time, blood loss were recorded. Preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and at last follow-up, the height of the fracture vertebra and the Cobb angle were obtained from X-ray pictures and were statistically analysed. Radiographic parameters on computed tomography (CT) pictures were used to get the encroachment rate of vertebral canal.
Results: 
The operative time was (87.3 +/-7.9) minutes and (125.3 +/- 13.6) minutes, and the blood loss was (273.7 +/- 23.4) mL and (512.6 +/- 37.7) mL in groups A and B, respectively; showing statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). The average follow-up time was 17.4 months (range, 11-31 months) in group A and 19.9 months (range, 12-33 months) in group B. All wounds achieved primary healing postoperatively without deaths and spinal cord injuries. Postoperative complications in group B included 3 cases of screws loosening, 1 case of screw breakage, and 3 cases of low back pain, and were given symptomatic management. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in the height of the fracture vertebra, the Cobb angle and the encroachment rate of vertebral canal preoperatively or postoperatively between two groups. There were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in the above three parameters between preoperation and postoperation in two groups, but there were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in the spinal correction between two groups. The losing-rate of spinal correction of the height of the fracture vertebra and the Cobb angle of group A was lower than group B, showing statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The short-term results of two decompression styles in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit were satisfactory, but indirect decompression has more merits than open decompression: shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower losing-rate of spinal correction, and better stabilization of vertebral column.},

Twenty patients who smoked were managed with a posterolateral arthrodesis with instrumentation (transpedicular fixation), and twenty-two patients who did not smoke were managed with a posterolateral arthrodesis without instrumentation. Of the patients who were managed with instrumentation, eight were randomized to treatment with a decompressive laminectomy and twelve, to treatment without it; in the group that was managed without instrumentation, the distribution was ten and twelve patients, respectively. The patients were followed clinically for a mean of 4.5 years (range, 3.5 to six years). Of the eighteen patients who had been managed with decompression, four had a pseudarthrosis and six had an unsatisfactory result compared with none and one of the twenty-four who had been managed without decompression (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). In the group of twenty patients (smokers) who had been managed with instrumentation, none of the twelve managed without decompression had a pseudarthrosis compared with one of the eight managed with decompression (p = 0.2). In the group of twenty-two patients (non-smokers) who had been managed without instrumentation, none of the twelve managed without decompression had a pseudarthrosis compared with three of the ten managed with decompression (p = 0.04). In the group managed with instrumentation, two of the eight who had had decompression had an unsatisfactory result compared with none of the twelve who had not had decompression. In the group managed without instrumentation, four of the ten who had had decompression had an unsatisfactory result compared with one of the twelve who had not had decompression. The addition of decompression to arthrodesis, performed with or without instrumentation, for the treatment of low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis in patients who do not have a serious neurological deficit does not appear to improve the result and may significantly increase the rates of pseudarthrosis and unsatisfactory results.},

We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the indications for anterior and posterior approaches in the management of CFD. Anterior approaches can restore cervical lordosis, and cause less postoperative pain and less wound problems. Posterior approaches are useful for direct reduction of locked facet joints and provide stronger fixation from a biomechanical point of view. Combined approaches can be used in more complex cases. Although both anterior and posterior approaches can be used interchangeably, there are some patients who may benefit from one of them over the other, as discussed in this review. Surgeons who treat cervical spine trauma should be able to perform both procedures as well as combined approaches to adequately manage CFD and improve patients' final outcomes.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Conventionally, short-segment fusion involves instrumentation of one healthy vertebra above and below the injured vertebra, skipping the injured level. This short-segment construct places less surgical burden on the patient compared with long-segment constructs, but is less stable biomechanically, and thus has resulted in clinical failures. The addition of two screws placed in the fractured vertebral body represents an attempt to improve the construct stiffness without sacrificing the benefits of short-segment fusion.
Purpose: 
To determine the biomechanical differences between four- and six-screw short-segment constructs for the operative management of an unstable L1 fracture.
Study design: 
Biomechanical study of instrumentation in vertebral body cadaveric models simulating an L1 axial load injury pattern.
Methods: 
Thirteen intact spinal segments from T12 to L2 were prepared from fresh-frozen cadaver spines. An axial load fracture of at least 50% vertebral body height was produced at L1 and then instrumented with pedicle screws. Specimens were evaluated in terms of construct stiffness, motion, and rod strain. Two conditions were tested: a four-screw construct with no screws at the L1 fractured body (4S) and a six-screw construct with screws at all levels (6S). The two groups were compared statistically by paired Student t test.
Results: 
The mean stiffness in flexion-extension was increased 31% (p<.03) with the addition of the two pedicle screws in L1. Relative motion in terms of vertical and axial rotations was not significantly different between the two groups. The L1-L2 rod strain was significantly increased in the six-screw construct compared with the four-screw construct (p<.001).
Conclusions: 
In a cadaveric L1 axial load fracture model, a six-screw construct with screws in the fractured level is more rigid than a four-screw construct that skips the injured vertebral body.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To compare cost and outcomes of surgical and percutaneous treatments of pathologic vertebral fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Standard Medicare 5% anonymized inpatient files (1999-2009) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a diagnosis of vertebral fracture without spinal cord injury and primary or metastatic bony malignancy were divided into percutaneous or surgical groups based on whether they received vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty or surgical treatment. Patients who had no intervention or both interventions were excluded. Cost, length of stay, and type of discharge were examined while controlling for demographic and comorbidity variables.
Results: 
A total of 451 patients were included; 52% received percutaneous treatment and 48% received surgery. Patients treated percutaneously were older (P < .001) and more likely to be female (P = .04). Percutaneous therapy predicted $14,862 less Medicare cost and $13,565 less overall cost (P < .001 for both), and 4.1 fewer inpatient days (P < .001). Patients who underwent surgery had higher odds of death (odds ratio = 3.38, P = .016), discharge to a rehabilitation facility (odds ratio = 3.3, P = .003), and transfer to another inpatient facility (odds ratio = 8.53, P < .001), and lower odds of discharge to home (odds ratio = 0.42, P < .001) and hospice (odds ratio = 0.08, P = .002).
Conclusions: 
In a Medicare population with bony malignancy and vertebral fractures, percutaneous therapy predicted significantly reduced cost and length of stay versus surgery. Patients who underwent percutaneous therapy were significantly less likely to die, be transferred, or be discharged to rehabilitation facilities, and were more likely to be discharged to home or hospice.},

  abstract={Aims: 
The best time for definitive orthopaedic care is often unclear in patients with multiple injuries. The objective of this study was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional laboratory data to determine readiness for surgery.
Patients and methods: 
A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, femur, or spine were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met: lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L. If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure; pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Results: 
In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%. The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups (p = 0.041). Patients who had IPR did not have significantly more complications (31.8%) than those who had FPR (22.6%; p = 0.078). Regression analysis showed male gender and injury severity score to be independent predictors of complications.
Conclusions: 
This study highlights important trends in the IPR and FPR groups, suggesting that differences in resuscitation parameters may guide care in certain patients; further study is, however, required. We advocate the use of the existing protocol, while research is continued for high-risk subgroups. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:122-7.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
The management of amyelic thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). Twenty-three patients were treated with PKP, and 25 patients with SSPI. They all presented with Type A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at two years follow-up. Radiographic data including the anterior and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle, as well as spinal canal compromise was also evaluated. The patients in both groups were similar regarding age, bone mineral density (BMD), follow-up period, severity of the deformity and fracture. Blood loss, operation time, and bed-rest time were less in the PKP group. VAS, ODI score improved more rapidly after surgery in the PKP group. No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at final follow-up (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha), the height of posterior vertebrae (Hp) and the kyphosis angle showed significant improvement in each group (p < 0.05). The postoperative improvement in spinal canal compromise was not statistically significant in the PKP group (p > 0.05); there was a significant improvement in the SSPI group (p < 0.05). Moreover, these postoperative radiographic assessments showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the improvement of canal compromise (p < 0.05). At final follow-up, remodeling of spinal canal compromise was detected in both groups.
Conclusion: 
Both PKP and SSPI appeared as effective and reliable operative techniques for selected amyelic thoracolumbar fractures in the short-term. PKP had a significantly smaller blood loss and shorter bed-rest time, but SSPI provided a better reduction. Long-time studies should be conducted to support these clinical outcomes.},

  abstract={Background: 
Spinal canal remodeling results according to Magerl classification and fracture localization after short- and long-segment posterior instrumentation treatment were evaluated in patients with thoracolumbar junction burst fracture.
Methods: 
Eighty patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: short-segment posterior instrumentation was applied in 36 patients [9F, 27M; Median age: 42.1 (range: 19-65)] and Group 2: long-segment posterior instrumentation was applied in 44 patients [18F, 26M; Median age: 46.3 (range: 18-78)]. Twenty patients had T12, 41 patients had L1 and 19 patients had L2 fracture. According to Magerl classification, 44 patients were A3.1, 19 were A3.2 and 17 were A3.3. In both groups, spinal canal remodeling effectiveness was evaluated postoperatively with respect to all parameters.
Results: 
Median follow-up time was 35.7 months for Group 1 (12-58) and 33.1 months for Group 2 (12-58). In both groups, spinal canal remodeling was statistically significant, but a higher recovery ratio was obtained in Group 2 in comparison to Group 1. According to Magerl classification, in type A3.3 fractures, a more significant remodeling was obtained in Group 2 patients (p=0.005). A significant difference was determined in Group 2 at the T12 level according to fracture localization (p=0.018).
Conclusion: 
An adequate spinal canal remodeling is obtained by posterior instrumentation, but in comminuted fractures like Magerl type A3.3, a better remodeling can be obtained by long-segment posterior instrumentation.},

  abstract={A prospective study was designed to determine whether posterior instrumentation of the spine in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures produces indirect decompression of the spinal canal leading to better remodeling and neurological recovery. The study was conducted in Kasturba Medical College Manipal, India. Sixty-eight consecutive cases of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were treated by posterior instrumentation, and approval from the hospital ethical committee was obtained. The degree of initial spinal canal compromise, indirect decompression, and remodeling were assessed from the computed tomography scans. The neurological status at the time of presentation and at final follow-up was assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association's modified Frankel's grading. The median canal compromise in patients with and without neurological deficit was 47.32 and 39.33%, respectively. The overall mean canal compromise at the time of admission, post-operative, and final follow-up were 47.37, 26.58 and 14.85%, respectively (P = <0.001). The median canal compromise in patients who recovered was 44.5% and in those with no neurological recovery was 55.85%. The median percentage of canal decompression achieved in patients who recovered was 22.15%, whereas it was 22% in those who did not recover. The median remodeling in recovered and non-recovered groups was 64.50 and 80%, respectively. None of these differences was statistically significant. This study shows that posterior instrumentation of the spine produces significant indirect decompression of the spinal canal and better remodeling. However, these factors may not improve the neurological recovery.},

  abstract={Background: 
Androgen-deprivation therapy is well-established for treating prostate cancer but is associated with bone loss and an increased risk of fracture. We investigated the effects of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, on bone mineral density and fractures in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
Methods: 
In this double-blind, multicenter study, we randomly assigned patients to receive denosumab at a dose of 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months or placebo (734 patients in each group). The primary end point was percent change in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 24 months. Key secondary end points included percent change in bone mineral densities at the femoral neck and total hip at 24 months and at all three sites at 36 months, as well as incidence of new vertebral fractures.
Results: 
At 24 months, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine had increased by 5.6% in the denosumab group as compared with a loss of 1.0% in the placebo group (P<0.001); significant differences between the two groups were seen at as early as 1 month and sustained through 36 months. Denosumab therapy was also associated with significant increases in bone mineral density at the total hip, femoral neck, and distal third of the radius at all time points. Patients who received denosumab had a decreased incidence of new vertebral fractures at 36 months (1.5%, vs. 3.9% with placebo) (relative risk, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.78; P=0.006). Rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
Denosumab was associated with increased bone mineral density at all sites and a reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures among men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00089674.)},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate geometrical stability and preservation of height gain of vertebral bodies after percutaneous vertebroplasty during 2 years' follow-up and to elucidate the geometric remodeling process of the vertebral bidisk unit (VDU) of the affected segment. Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with pain resistant to analgetic drugs were treated with polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty. Mean +/- standard error cement volume was 5.1 +/- 2.0 ml. Vertebral geometry was documented by sagittal and coronal reformations from multidetector computed tomography data sets: anterior, posterior, and lateral vertebral heights, end plate angles, and compression index (CI = anterior/posterior height). Additionally, the VDU (vertebral bodies plus both adjacent disk spaces) was calculated from the multidetector computed tomography data sets: anterior, posterior, and both lateral aspects. Patients were assigned to two groups: moderate compression with CI of >0.75 (group 1) and severe compression with CI of <0.75 (group 2). A total of 83 vertebral bodies of 30 patients (7 men, 23 women, age 70.7 +/- 9.7 years, range 40-82 years) were treated with vertebroplasty and prospectively followed for 24 months. In the moderate compression group (group 1), the vertebral heights were stabilized over time at the preinterventional levels. Compared with group 1, group 2 showed a greater anterior height gain (+2.8 +/- 2.2 mm vs. +0.8 +/- 2.0 mm, P < 0.001), better reduction of end plate angle (-4.9 +/- 4.8 degrees vs. -1.0 +/- 2.7 degrees , P < 0.01), and improved CI (+0.12 +/- 0.13 vs. +0.02 +/- 0.07, P < 0.01) and demonstrated preserved anterior height gain at 2 years (+1.2 +/- 3.2 mm, P < 0.01) as well as improved end plate angles (-5.2 +/- 5.0 degrees , P < 0.01) and compression indices (+0.11 +/- 0.15, P < 0.01). Thus, posterior height loss of vertebrae and adjacent intervertebral disk spaces contributed to a remodeling of the VDU, resulting in some compensation of the kyphotic malposition of the affected vertebral segment. Vertebroplasty improved vertebral geometry during midterm follow-up. In severe vertebral compression, significant height gain and improvement of end plate angles were achieved. The remodeling of the VDUs contributes to reduction of kyphosis and an overall improvement of the statics of the spine.},

The study included 26 patients; 9 underwent hip hemiarthroplasty (mean age +/- SD: 71.0 +/- 10.2 years, group EN) for femoral neck fractures. 7 underwent osteosynthesis (75.3 +/- 8.2 years, group OS) for trochanteric fractures, and 10 subjects had spinal compression fractures (68.2 +/- 12.0 years, group CO). No operative procedures were performed in group CO. Urinary pyridinoline (Pyr), deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Crosslaps by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) (CTx-ELISA and CTx-RIA) and serum N-terminal mid-fragment osteocalcin (OCN-Mid) by ELISA were analyzed at the time of admission and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 after operation or, in the case of group CO, after admission. As a whole, bone resorption markers started to increase from week 1, with various peak values between weeks 4 and 8 depending upon the particular marker, but returned to the initial vales at week 24. OCN-Mid started to increase from week 8 and remained at elevated levels at week 24. In groups EN and OS, bone resorption markers changed in the same manner as they did as a whole group. OCN-Mid did not change in group EN, although it increased significantly from week 8 in group OS. No biochemical markers changed significantly in group CO. In conclusion, bone resorption was accelerated at an early stage due to acute osteonecrosis or bed rest, followed by bone formation due to callus or mechanical stress later on. As far as bone resorption markers are concerned, 24 weeks are enough to eliminate the effect of fracture.},

  abstract={Objective: 
This retrospective cohort study was performed to investigate clinical efficacy of TBGA compared with pedicle screw fixation (PSF).
Methods: 
A total of 86 eligible patients with single-level simple thoracolumbar compression fracture (TLCF) received TBGA (n = 41) or PSF (n = 45) from January 2013 to July 2015. The patients were evaluated using plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively. The radiologic examinations were performed at each time point postoperatively. Clinical status was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. In addition, anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), kyphosis angle (KA), radiologic adjacent segment pathology (RASP), and complication rates were also compared between the 2 groups. The average follow-up period of patients was 26.1 months.
Results: 
Significant clinical improvements in ODI, VAS, AVBH, and KA were achieved in both TBGA and PSF groups after surgery, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in improvements of ODI and VAS between the TBGA and PSF groups (P > 0.05). Similarly, improvements of AVBH and KA showed no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). In addition, the rates of RASP and complications in PSF group were significantly higher than the TBGA group during the follow-up period (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
TBGA can achieve satisfactory clinical effects in treatment of simple TLCF. TBGA involves shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower RASP, and lower complication rates and could be more suitable for the surgical treatment of simple TLCF.},

  abstract={Background: 
Thoracolumbar fractures are among the most common types of damages caused to the spinal cord .Therefore, the aim of this study was the comparison of surgical or nonsurgical treatment outcomes in patients with thoracolumbar fracture with score 4 of the thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) METHODS:: This study was clinical trial and double blind. Patients with thoracolumbar fracture with score 4 of TLICS entered at this research. We divided patients in 2 groups randomly (each group 25 patients) and then we followed patients for 1 year after start of treatment. We checked duration of bedridden and absence work, pain every 3 months for 1 year and radiography every 3 months for 1 year.
Results: 
Pain in operative group was lower than nonoperative group (P = .02). Regional sagittal angles (RSA) in operative group was lower than nonoperative group in all time (P = .0001). Mean of time of return to work in operative group was lower than nonoperative group (P = .001).
Conclusions: 
Pain and mean of time of return to work and RSA in operative group was lower than nonoperative group. The present data suggest the use of operative method in patients with thoracolumbar fracture with score 4 of TLICS.},

  abstract={Background: 
Some studies have reported that the conventional intersegmental pedicle screws (4-screw fixation [4S]) device for thoracolumbar fractures was associated with inadequate reduction of fractured vertebrae, insufficient correction of kyphosis, and implant failure. Recently, a series of biomechanical studies has confirmed that the addition of intermediate fixation screws (6-screw fixation [6S]) could provide stronger fixation and better reduction of fractured vertebrae. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiologic efficacy of the additional intermediate screws remains unclear.
Methods: 
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was used to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes and complications of posterior pedicle screws combined with intermediate screws fixation versus conventional intersegmental pedicle screw fixation. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE, OVID, and Springer according to a search strategy, selecting articles based on inclusion criteria, and extracted data from these reports. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed. Pooled estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: 
Six randomized controlled trials involving 310 patients were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed statistically similar baseline characteristics, hospital stays, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and infection rates between the 4S group and the 6S group. The 6S group had significantly less correction loss of segmental angle and of anterior vertebral height compression, and lower implant failure rate. The 6S group also showed a slightly longer operative time and more blood loss than did the 4S group.
Conclusions: 
Based on our analysis, the combined intermediate screws fixation technique was associated with significantly improved radiologic outcomes but did not seem to compromise other perioperative outcomes.},

  abstract={Background: 
Posterior fixation and fusion is the primary treatment for thoracolumbar fractures, although this treatment may sacrifice range of motion (ROM) to achieve stability, rather than treating the fracture itself. Two issues addressed when treating thoracolumbar fractures are 1) replacing the fractured vertebrae, especially the upper end plate of the injured vertebrae and 2) providing strong fixation with biomechanical stability and flexibility.
Methods: 
This retrospective study included 61 consecutive patients with thoracic or lumbar fractures treated from October 2010 to May 2014. Patients were divided into 1 of 2 groups: group A, intravertebral bone graft with balloon kyphoplasty (nonfusion surgery), and group B, traditional posterior fixation and fusion surgery. The visual analog scale was used preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed preoperatively. Radiography was performed postoperatively at 3 months and 2 years. At 3 months after surgery, computed tomography was used to confirm healing of the vertebral fracture.
Results: 
All fractures in both groups were reduced successfully, and deformities were improved. After the removal of hardware in group A, ROM at the injury level recovered, and at 2 years, there was no loss of vertebral height or recurrence of deformity. There was no hardware failure in group A, but there was evidence of screw loosening in 3 screws in group B.
Conclusions: 
Nonfusion treatment of intravertebral bone graft assisted with balloon kyphoplasty showed good fracture reduction, deformity correction, fracture healing, and ROM maintenance. There were no complications associated with the implant.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the effect of fusion on short segment including fractured level (SSIFL) and long segment (LS) transpedicular fixation after acute thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. The 2-year clinical and radiologic follow-up results of the 2 groups also were compared.
Methods: 
Seventy-four patients were randomized into one of 2 groups: SSIFL (n = 39) or LS (n = 35). The SSIFL group included one level above and one level below, including the fracture level, whereas the LS group included 2 levels above and 2 levels below, excluding the fracture level, for the transpedicular fixation. Fusion was assessed by technetium 99m-methylendiphosphonate, bone scintigraphy, and single-photon emission computed tomography. The 2-year follow-up results were compared clinically (Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale) and radiologically (kyphosis angle, sagittal index, anterior vertebral body height loss) at regular intervals. The clinical scores and radiologic parameters of patients with and without fusion also were compared.
Results: 
The number of patients with fusion was significantly greater in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group. There was a significant reduction of the clinical scores of patients who had fusion compared with the fusion-free group; however, there was no radiologically significant difference. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the SSIFL and LS groups in terms of the 2-year radiologic and clinical follow-up results.
Conclusions: 
Fusion occurred sooner and patients experienced earlier clinical recovery in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE Thoracolumbar fractures account for 90% of spinal fractures, with the burst subtype corresponding to 20% of this total. Controversy regarding the best treatment for this condition remains. The traditional surgical approach, when indicated, involves spinal fixation and arthrodesis. Newer studies have brought the need for fusion associated with internal fixation into question. Not performing arthrodesis could reduce surgical time and intraoperative bleeding without affecting clinical and radiological outcomes. With this study, the authors aimed to assess the effect of fusion, adjuvant to internal fixation, on surgically treated thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS A search of the Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed to identify randomized trials that compared the use and nonuse of arthrodesis in association with internal fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The search encompassed all data in these databases up to February 28, 2016. RESULTS Five randomized/quasi-randomized trials, which involved a total of 220 patients and an average follow-up time of 69.1 months, were included in this review. No significant difference between groups in the final scores of the visual analog pain scale or Low Back Outcome Scale was detected. Surgical time and blood loss were significantly lower in the group of patients who did not undergo fusion (p < 0.05). Among the evaluated radiological outcomes, greater mobility in the affected segment was found in the group of those who did not undergo fusion. No significant difference between groups in the degree of kyphosis correction, loss of kyphosis correction, or final angle of kyphosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS The data reviewed in this study suggest that the use of arthrodesis did not improve clinical outcomes, but it was associated with increased surgical time and higher intraoperative bleeding and did not promote significant improvement in radiological parameters.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety between patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who underwent posterior fixation alone (non-fusion) and supplemented with fusion.
Methods: 
A comprehensive search of related literature was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library. Clinical outcomes (LBOS and VAS), surgical outcomes (operation time, blood loss, hospital stay and perioperative complications), and radiographic outcomes (kyphotic angle, decreased vertebral body height and segmental motion) were assessed in the meta-analysis. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software.
Results: 
Five RCTs and three retrospective studies including a total of 445 cases were identified. We found that there was no significant difference in terms of LBOS, VAS, implant-related complications, kyphotic and VBH parameters. However, there was a significant difference regarding blood loss, operation time, segmental motion and donor site pain between fusion and non-fusion.
Conclusion: 
This meta-analysis demonstrated that posterior fixation alone could achieve satisfactory clinical and radiological results in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture. Moreover, posterior fixation without fusion was superior to additional fusion with less blood loss, shorter operation time, better segmental motion and lower donor site pain.},

  abstract={Background: 
Thoracolumbar burst fractures (TBFs) are often followed by bilateral pedicle screw fixation (BPSF) at the level of fracture using posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). There has been increasing support for unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) in an attempt to reduce complications and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic results of UPSF versus BPSF at the level of fracture using SSPI in the treatment of severe TBFs.
Methods: 
The records of 42 consecutive patients with severe TBFs who underwent SSPI were divided into 2 groups according to the number of screws in the fracture level, including 20 patients (five screws) in UPSF group and 22 patients (six screws) in BPSF. Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded before surgery, after surgery, and 1.5 years after operation. The patients'clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). For radiological evaluation, changes in local kyphosis angle (LKA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH) were investigated using plain radiographs.
Results: 
Mean follow-up was 18.3 months for UPSF group and 19.0 months for BPSF group (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the age, gender, fracture type and site in both groups. Radiologically, no statistically difference was observed between the two groups in corrected rate of LKA, VWA, or AVH(all P > 0.05). With respect to clinical variants including VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the UPSF group seemed to have advantages over BPSF group in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, hospitalization time (P > 0.05). Especially, implant cost for the BPSF group was 22% greater than the UPSF group. No serious complications occurred in our study. In all cases, fusions healed well and no revision surgery was performed for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation during follow-up.
Conclusions: 
The present study is the first to demonstrate that patients undergoing SSPI with UPSF as compared with BPSF for the treatment of severe TBFs had similar clinical and radiologic outcomes.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) fractures associated with UIV screw fixation (unicortical vs bicortical) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation after adult spinal deformity surgery. METHODS A single-center, single-surgeon consecutive series of adult patients who underwent lumbar fusion for ≥ 4 levels (that is, the lower instrumented vertebra at the sacrum or pelvis and the UIV of the thoracolumbar spine [T9-L2]) were retrospectively reviewed. Age, sex, follow-up duration, sagittal UIV angle immediately postoperatively including several balance-related parameters (lumbar lordosis [LL], pelvic incidence, and sagittal vertical axis), bone mineral density, UIV screw fixation type, UIV PMMA augmentation, and UIV fracture were evaluated. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group U, 15 patients with unicortical screw fixation at the UIV; Group P, 16 with bicortical screw fixation and PMMA augmentation at the UIV; and Group B, 21 with bicortical screw fixation without PMMA augmentation at the UIV. RESULTS The mean number of levels fused was 6.5 ± 2.5, 7.5 ± 2.5, and 6.5 ± 2.5; the median age was 50 ± 29, 72 ± 6, and 59 ± 24 years; and the mean follow-up was 31.5 ± 23.5, 13 ± 6, and 24 ± 17.5 months in Groups U, P, and B, respectively (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in balance-related parameters (LL, sagittal vertical axis, pelvic incidence-LL, and so on) among the groups. UIV fracture rates in Groups U (0%), P (31.3%), and B (42.9%) increased in sequence by group (p = 0.006). UIV bicortical screw fixation increased the risk for UIV fracture (OR 5.39; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Bicortical screw fixation at the UIV is a major risk factor for early UIV compression fracture, regardless of whether a thoracolumbosacral orthosis is used. To reduce the proximal junctional failure, unicortical screw fixation at the UIV is essential in adult spinal deformity correction surgery.},

  abstract={Prospective cohort study. To evaluate whether failure of the fracture fragment at the anterior column reduction in thoracolumbar fracture has an influence on the final radiologic and clinical outcomes.Cervical teardrop fracture has caused wide concern in spinal surgery field. Although similar fracture fragment at the anterior column was also observed in thoracolumbar burst fractures, the conception of teardrop fracture in thoracolumbar fractures was rarely mentioned in the literature, let alone a study.Fifty patients who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fractures with a fracture fragment at the anterior column were prospectively analyzed. Twenty-seven patients in whom the fragments were reduced by posterior surgery, verified by postoperative X-ray or CT, were included in the reduced group, and 23 patients were included in the nonreduced group. Radiologic and clinical outcomes of both groups were compared after over 2 years follow-up.There was no significant difference regarding to Cobb angle, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, and disc grade between the 2 groups preoperatively. At final follow-up, the mean angle of kyphosis was 13.91° ± 3.47° in the nonreduced group and 8.42° ± 2.07° in the reduced groups (P < 0.01). All fractures consolidated in the reduced group, but the nonreduced group revealed 3 cases with nonunion. Besides, the average Pfirrmann grade of degenerative disc adjacent to the fractured vertebral was 2.87 ± 1.18 in the nonreduced group, higher than 1.81 ± 0.62 in the reduced group (P < 0.01). The ODI score in the nonreduced group was 0.54 ± 0.13 and 0.36 ± 0.12 in the reduced group (P < 0.01).In the present study, failure reduction of the fracture fragment at the anterior column could result in poor radiologic and clinical outcomes of the thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with posterior surgery.

  abstract={Background: 
In case of complex vertebral fractures, posterior fixation is often required for correction of deformity and instability. Fixation is commonly supported by balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) anterior. A development of BKP is radiofrequency-targeted vertebral augmentation (RF-TVA), which leads to comparable results for augmentation and pain relief.
Objective: 
This prospective study evaluates the outcome of posterior fixation combined with RF-TVA or BKP, respectively.
Methods: 
VAS, ODI, kyphosis angle and vertebral height of 44 patients were evaluated preoperatively, 3 and 12 months postoperatively.
Results: 
Both treatments improved vertebral height and kyphosis angle. At 12 months, vertebral height restoration was still significantly better in the BKP group (p < 0.001) and the improvement of kyphosis angle was comparable between both groups (p = 0.71). VAS and ODI improvements were significantly better in the RF-TVA group (p < 0.001). 8% of BKP patients had cement extravasations, compared to 10.5% in the RF-TVA group (p = 1.0).
Conclusions: 
Combining posterior fixation with RF-TVA leads to better results of VAS and ODI, whereas the vertebral height restoration was favorable for patients treated with BKP. Cement leakage was comparable between both groups. It was asymptomatic and within reported ranges. Limitations of this study are the patient number and different stabilization instrumentation.},

Early implant failure and donor-site complication remain a concern in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent one-above and-below short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation with fusion. Our aim was to evaluate the results of short-segment pedicle instrumentation enforced by two augmenting screws or injectable artificial bone cement in the fractured vertebra, and compare the differences between these two PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective clinical and radiographic study. Twenty-seven patients were treated with a six-screw construct (group 1), and twenty-nine patients underwenta four-screw construct and fractured vertebra augmentation by injectable calcium sulfate/phosphate cement (group 2). Posterior or posterolateral fusions were not performed in both groups. The severity of the fractured vertebra was evaluated by the load-sharing classification (LSC). Local kyphosis and anterior body height of the fractured vertebra were measured and were follow-up at least 2 years. Any implant failure or loss of correction >10° degrees at the final was defined as failure of surgery. Patients' clinical results were assessed by the Denis scale.
Results: 
Blood loss and operation time were less in group 1 (126.2±9.7 vs. 267.6±126.1ml, p<0.001 and 141.2±48.7 vs. 189.8±16.4min, p<0.001). Immediately after surgery, group 2 had a better local kyphosis angle (3.7±5.3 vs.6.0±4.1°, p=0.047) and acquired more anterior body height (94.9%±7.6% vs. 84.9%±10.0%, p<0.001). Both groups had similar clinical results (pain score: 1.5±0.8vs. 1.4±0.6, p=0.706; work score: 1.7±0.9 vs. 1.6±1.0, p=0.854). Group 1 had 3 cases of surgery failure; group 2 had 8 cases of implant failure (p=0.121). The average LSC score of these 11 patients with surgical failure was 7.2.
Conclusion: 
Thesix-screw construct had the advantage of shorter operating time, less blood loss, and lower failure rate. For those patients with anLSC score ≧7, posterior short-segment instrumentation should be used cautiously.},

  abstract={This study was to investigate the clinical and radiographical outcomes of anterior spinal column reconstruction using structural femoral shaft allografts in osteoporotic patients. Retrospective analyses of medical records, radiographic parameters, and postoperative complications were performed in twenty-one patients who underwent anterior spinal column reconstruction surgery for osteoporotic vertebral collapse or nonunion. Surgical invasiveness, clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and radiographic outcomes were evaluated. Ambulatory status and back pain significantly improved. The Cobb's angle of segmental kyphosis significantly improved immediately after surgery with slight progression at the final follow-up. There were two cases of failed reconstruction with marked progression of kyphosis; both were related to loosening of screws rather than subsidence of the graft. Anterior spinal column reconstruction using femoral shaft allografts improved kyphosis and resulted in minimal subsidence and therefore is recommended as an effective treatment option for dealing with osteoporotic vertebral collapse and kyphotic deformity.},

  abstract={Background: 
The treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. Long-segment pedicle screw constructs may be stiffer and impart greater forces on adjacent segments compared with short-segment constructs. Short-segment pedicle screw fixation alone may be associated with instrumentation failure. Reinforcement fractured vertebra by the placement of an additional 2 screws at fracture level may be useful in thoracolumbar fractures for restoration of anterior vertebral height.
Material and methods: 
We retrospectively analyzed 35 patients (21 males, 14 females) with unstable thoracolumbar fractures. The patients were divided into 2 groups. In group I, patients were operated with posterior approach via the use of pedicle screws fixed long (2 levels above and 1 or 2 levels below of the fractured vertebra). In group II patients, short-segment stabilization with additional screwing at fracture level was made. Immediate postoperative radiologic evaluations were done by measuring the correction and maintenance of kyphotic angle at the fracture level, Cobb angle, and height of fractured vertebra.
Results: 
Average local kyphosis angle, anterior kyphotic angle at the fracture level, and Cobb angle were not statistically significantly different in the postoperative period (P > 0.05); however, postoperative anterior height of fractured vertebra was statistically significantly different between the 2 groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
We compared a standard long-segment construct with a short-segment construct using instrumentation of the fractured segment. Short-segment pedicle screw fixation with screwing of fractured vertebra in unstable thoracolumbar fracture levels is an effective method to restoring anterior vertebral height for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures. It also provides anterior column support.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A cost-utility analysis (CUA).
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of pedicle screw removal after posterior fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Pedicle screw instrumentation is a standard fixation method for unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture. However, removal of the pedicle screw after successful fusion remains controversial because the clinical benefits remain unclear. CUA can help clinicians make appropriate decisions about optimal health care for pedicle screw removal after successful fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
We conducted a single-center, retrospective, longitudinal matched-cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes. In total, 88 consecutive patients who had undergone pedicle screw instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fracture with successful fusion confirmed by computed tomography (CT) were used in this study. In total, 45 patients wanted to undergo implant removal surgery (R group), and 43 decided not to remove the implant (NR group). A CUA was conducted from the health care perspective. The direct costs of health care were obtained from the medical bill of each patient. Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores, validated by Short Form 6D, were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Total costs and gained QALY were calculated at 1 year (1 year) and 2 years (2 years) compared with baseline. Results are expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Different discount rates (0%, 3%, and 5%) were applied to both cost and QALY for sensitivity analysis.
Results: 
Baseline patient variables were similar between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The additional benefits of implant removal (0.201 QALY at 2 years) were achieved with additional costs ($2541 at 2 years), equating to an ICER of $12,641/QALY. On the basis of the different discount rates, the robustness of our study's results was also determined.
Conclusion: 
Implant removal after successful fusion in a thoracolumbar burst fracture is cost-effective until postoperative year 2.

  abstract={Background: 
A review of the literature showed that posterior short-segment fixation including the fractured vertebra (PSFFV) has better outcomes in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures(TBFs) than patients with short-segment pedicle screw fixation(SSPF) alone. However, its efficacy in mild TBFs with load-sharing scores of 3 and 4 points has not been specifically analyzed. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical, functional and radiologic results of PSFFV with SSPF for mild TBFs and to determine whether the screws in the fractured vetebra were necessary for these patients.
Methods: 
In this retrospective study, sixty-nine patients with mild TBFs were divided into 2 groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group A included 34 patients treated by SSPF (four screws:one level above and below the fracture), and Group B included 35 patients treated by PSFFV (six screws: including the fractured vertebra). Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and at follow-up. They included clinical outcomes: visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Being a radiology-based study, the radiologic measures included vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH).
Results: 
A sum of 69 patients (34 patients in Group A and 35 patients in Group B) were enrolled in the study. The patients in both the groups showed similar outcomes with regards to age, gender, fracture type and site. We did not find any statistically difference between the two groups in corrected rate of VWA or AVH (P > 0.05). In terms of clinical variants such as VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the SSPF had advantages over PSFFV method in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage and postoperative hospitalization time (P > 0.05). There were no serious complications occurring during our study, such as infection, blood vessel injury, spinal cord or nerve root injury. No patient needed revision for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation.
Conclusions: 
SSPF alone is a safe and effective surgical method for restoration and maintenance of vertebral column stability in treating mild TBFs. It gives excellent clinical and radiological results regardless of whether the fractured vertebra is included in the fixation or not.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
This study evaluated differences in outcome variables between percutaneous, traditional, and paraspinal posterior open approaches for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures without neurologic deficit.
Methods: 
A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed. In this meta-analysis, we conducted online searches of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase using the search terms "thoracolumbar fractures", "lumbar fractures", ''percutaneous'', "minimally invasive", ''open", "traditional", "posterior", "conventional", "pedicle screw", "sextant", and "clinical trial". The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the studies that met the selection criteria. Clinical outcomes were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95 % confidence interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ 2 test and I 2 statistics.
Results: 
There were 4 randomized controlled trials and 14 observational articles included in this analysis. Percutaneous approach was associated with better ODI score, less Cobb angle correction, less Cobb angle correction loss, less postoperative VBA correction, and lower infection rate compared with open approach. Percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter operative duration, longer intraoperative fluoroscopy, less postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% in comparison with traditional open approach. No significant difference was found in Cobb angle correction, postoperative VBA, VBA correction loss, Postoperative VBH%, VBH correction loss, and pedicle screw misplacement between percutaneous approach and open approach. There was no significant difference in operative duration, intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% between percutaneous approach and paraspianl approach.
Conclusions: 
The functional and the radiological outcome of percutaneous approach would be better than open approach in the long term. Although trans-muscular spatium approach belonged to open fixation methods, it was strictly defined as less invasive approach, which provided less injury to the paraspinal muscles and better reposition effect.},

  abstract={Treating vertebral body fractures is challenging when there is relevant pre-existing spinal degeneration. Both vertebral body fractures and spinal degeneration are related to the physiological aging process. The increases in both are linked to increases in life expectancy. Several factors promote spinal degeneration and increase fracture risk, such as disc degeneration, spinal imbalance and osteoporosis. The main diagnostic and therapeutic challenge is to identify the sources of pain and to start appropriate therapy. A structured and advanced algorithm is then essential. Unstable fractures must always be stabilised. However, surgical strategy may be greatly influenced if there are also degenerative diseases, such as segmental decompression, multisegmental instrumentation or fusion, or complex reconstructive spondylodesis, including osteotomies. Notwithstanding this, the individual therapy concept has to be adapted to the demands and pathology of the individual patient.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes between open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, which has received scant research attention to date. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight-four patients with acute and subacute thoracolumbar fractures who were treated with SSPSF from January 2013 to June 2014 at the Changzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Changzhou, China) were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into 4 groups: the OPSF with 4 basic screws (OPSF-4) group, the OPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (OPSF-6) group, the PPSF with 4 basic screws (PPSF-4) group, and the PPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (PPSF-6) group. The intraoperative, immediate postoperative, and over 1-year follow-up outcomes were evaluated and compared among these groups. RESULTS Blood loss in the PPSF-4 group and the PPSF-6 group was significantly less than in the OPSF-4 group and the OPSF-6 group (P<0.05). The OPSF-6 group exhibited significantly higher immediate postoperative correction percentage of anterior column height of fractured vertebra than the other 3 groups (P<0.05), and higher correction of sagittal regional Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of injured vertebra than in the PPSF-4 and -6 groups (P<0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in the correction loss of percentage of anterior column height, and loss of sagittal Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of fractured vertebrae at final follow-up among the 4 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS OPSF with 6 screws had an advantage in the correction of injured vertebral height and kyphosis, and PPSF reduced the intraoperative blood loss of patients.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective clinical trial in thoracolumbar trauma with 5-year follow-up.
Objective: 
To analyze clinical and radiographic outcomes of minimal invasive surgery, and the rational of circumferential fracture treatment with regard to age, degenerative changes, bone mineral density, and global sagittal balance.
Summary of background data: 
Non-neurologic fractures with anterior column defect can be treated by posterior percutaneous instrumentation and selective anterior fusion. After consolidation, instrumentation can be removed at 1 year to provide mobility in non-fused segments.
Methods: 
Fifty-one patients, 47 (18-75) years, were operated for A2, A3, or B-type fractures. Visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were assessed. Radiographic measurements were: sagittal index, regional kyphosis, T4-T12 kyphosis, L1-S1 lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, and T9 tilt. Anterior fusion and facet joints were analyzed on computed tomography (CT) at 1 year.
Results: 
The ODI was 8.8 before accident, 35.4 at 3 months, 17.8 at 2 years, 14.4 at 5 years. The VAS was 2.0 at 3 months and 1.0 at 5 years. The sagittal index was 18.0° preoperatively and 1.0° at 3 months (P < 0.0001). A loss of reduction of 1.1° occurred after implant removal (P = 0.009). Global sagittal balance remained unchanged. Ten patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis had a worse ODI: 24.7 versus 11.9 (P = 0.016), and a greater loss of correction: 4.9° versus 1.3° (P = 0.007). Cages filled with cancellous bone from the fractured vertebra fused regularly. Spontaneous facet joint fusions were observed in two patients at the fracture level in B-type injuries.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous instrumentation and selective anterior fusion using autologous bone and mesh cages lead to high fusion rates, which provided good long-term clinical results in younger patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Sagittal alignment was maintained after instrumentation removal without damaging paravertebral muscles. Outcomes were worse in elderly patients presenting osteopenia or osteoporosis.

  abstract={Introduction: 
The anatomy and biomechanics of the thoracolumbar spine place these segments at high risk of trauma injuries. Treatment options are either conservative or surgical, and there is a lack of consensus about the right indications. International scientific publications agree only on basic surgical principles: vertebral stability, deformity correction, protection of neurological structures and fast functional recovery. The most commonly used approach is the posterior approach, which allows the best management of most vertebral fracture patterns. The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of monosegmental stabilisation with those of bisegmental stabilisation and fusion in the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures.
Materials and methods: 
This retrospective clinical and radiological study evaluated 48 consecutive patients treated with monosegmental (Group M; n=14) or bisegmental (Group B; n=34) posterior pedicular instrumentation for thoracolumbar fractures. Fractures were classified by the new AO Spine TLIC system. Average follow-up was 30 months. Clinical outcomes in both groups were statistically compared. Radiological outcomes were evaluated in terms of vertebral anterior body height restoration and correction of the kyphotic deformity.
Results: 
Radiographical results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in vertebral body height restoration and correction of the kyphotic deformity. The mean postoperative somatic vertebral anterior body height in Group M was 25.8±4.52mm and in Group B it was 24.43±4.27mm. In Group M the mean postoperative kyphotic deformity was 11.10±5.71°, in Group B it was 9.09±4.93°.
Conclusions: 
The results of this study confirm the validity of short and very short instrumentation for the treatment of well-selected type A and B vertebral fractures. In C type fractures correct surgical indication must be evaluated on an individual basis.},

  abstract={Background: 
The surgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures frequently involves posterior pedicle screw fixation. However, the application of short- or long-segment instrumentation is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of the short-segment fixation with inclusion of the fracture level (SSFIFL) versus the traditional long-segment fixation (LSF) for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures.
Methods: 
From December 2009 to February 2014, 60 patients with unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures (T11-L2) were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group 1 included 30 patients treated by SSFIFL (six-screw construct including the fracture level). Group 2 included 30 patients treated by LSF (eight-screw construct excluding the fracture level). Local kyphosis angle (LKA), anterior body height (ABH), posterior body height (PBH), ABH/PBH ratio of fractured vertebra, and Asia Scale Impairment Scale were evaluated.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in regard to age, sex, trauma etiology, fracture level, fracture type, neurologic status, pre-operative LKA, ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio and follow-up (p > 0.05). Reduction of post-traumatic kyphosis (assessed with LKA) and restoration of fracture-induced wedge shape of the vertebral body (assessed with ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio) at post-operative period were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.234; p = 0.754). There was no significant difference between the two groups in term of correction loss at the last follow-up too (LKA was 15.97° ± 5.62° for SSFIFL and 17.76° ± 11.22° for LSF [p = 0.427]). Neurological outcome was similar in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Inclusion of fracture level in a short-segment fixation for a thoracolumbar junction fractures results in a kyphosis correction and in a maintenance of the sagittal alignment similar to a long-segment instrumentation. Finally, this technique allowed us to save two or more segments of vertebral motion.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Anterior approach indications in unstable thoracolumbar fractures (UTLF) are debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of anterior fixation and expandable prosthetic vertebral body cage (EPVBC) implantation alone or combined with a posterior approach in the management of UTLF.
Materials and methods: 
Ninety-three patients underwent anterior fixation with implantation of an EPVBC for UTLF from T7 to L5. Long-term kyphosis and vertebral height loss reduction, functional outcomes including visual analogical scale and Oswestry disability index were evaluated.
Results: 
Anterior fixation led to a significant increase of vertebral body height with a gain of 13% after a previous posterior approach, 38% after a single anterior approach and 65% after combined posterior and anterior approaches (P=0.0001). However, anterior fixation did not significantly enhance the vertebral regional kyphosis angle (P=0.08), except in cases of single anterior approach for thoracic fractures (P=0.03). No significant difference was found between early, 3 months and 1 year postoperative vertebral regional kyphosis angle and vertebral body height (P=0.6). Complete fusion was routinely observed at 1 year postoperatively. rhBMP2 implantation in selected cases appears to be a safe and reliable strategy. No infections or surgical revisions were observed after the anterior approach.
Conclusion: 
Anterior approach and EPVBC implantation, in UTLF, is a safe and effective procedure, providing long-term vertebral body height and kyphosis correction. Adverse effects of anterior approach remain acceptable. Single anterior fixation is a reliable surgical alternative in thoracic fractures without posterior spine segment injury or spinal cord compression. These results prompted us to extend anterior approach indications in oncology and infectious diseases.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Our aim was to evaluate the results of short-segment pedicle instrumentation with screw insertion in the fracture level and find factors predicting kyphosis recurrence in thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
We retrospectively analysed 122 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who were divided into two groups: kyphosis recurrence and no kyphosis recurrence. Pre-operative radiographic data comprising Cobb angle (CA), regional angle, anterior vertebra height (AVH), upper intervertebral angle, vertebral wedge angle (VWA), pre-anteroposterior A/P approach, superior endplate fracture, load-sharing classification (LSC) score and clinical data including age, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score were compared between groups. T test, Pearson's chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were calculated for variables.
Results: 
CA, VWA and AVH were significantly corrected after surgery. CA changed from 23.7 to 3.0 (p <0.001), VWA from 38.7 to 9.6 (p <0.001) and AVH from 48.8 % to 91.2 % (p <0.001). These parameters were well maintained during the follow-up period with a mild, tolerant loss of correction. Neurological function and pain were significantly improved without deterioration. Age, pre-A/P and pre-AVH < 50 % influenced kyphosis recurrence (p = 0.032, 0.026, 0.011, respectively).
Conclusions: 
Short-segment pedicle instrumentation including the fractured vertebra was effective in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. The loss of correction at follow-up after implant removal was associated with age, A/P ratio and anterior vertebral height < 50 %.},

  abstract={Thoracolumbar burst fractures account for up to 17% of major spinal fractures. Both conservative and operative treatments are widely used in clinical practice to manage thoracolumbar burst fractures. Previous studies showed good functional results with both treatments, but surgical approach has been associated with higher cost and risks of causing unnecessary adverse effects. Searching in Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, we identified 14 systematic reviews including 25 randomized trials. We combined the evidence using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table following the GRADE approach. We concluded that operative treatment may decrease the risk of neurologic impairment, but in turn, could increase the risk of general complications. It is unclear whether there are differences in pain reduction, improvement in function and quality of life, need for subsequent surgery or radiographic progression of kyphosis in both groups.},

From January 2008 to May 2014,36 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent operation of decompression, fusion, and internal fixation was retrospective analyzed. Among them, 16 patients were treated through posterior approach as posterior group, including 13 males and 3 females aged from 37 to 62 years old; 9 cases caused by falling injury, 3 cases by traffic accident injury,4 cases by heavy aboved;the injury segment was on T₁₂ in 2 cases, L₁ in 5 cases, L₂ in 7 cases, L₃ in 2 cases; according ASIA grade, 3 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 2 cases were grade C, 5 cases were grade D, 4 cases were grade E; the time between injury and operation ranged from 5 to 15 days. Other 20 patients were treated through anterior-lateral approach as anterior-lateral group, including 15 males and 5 females with age from 27 to 62 years old; 12 cases caused by falling injury, 4 cases by traffic accident injury, 4 cases by heavy aboved; the injury segment was on T₁₂ in 2 cases, L₁, in 7 cases, L₂ in 9 cases, L₃ in 2 cases; for ASIA grade: 4 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 4 cases were grade C, 6 cases were grade D, 4 cases were grade E; the time between injury and operation ranged from 4 to 12 days. The operation time, bleeding during operation and postoperative drainage volume were observed in two groups,and the changes of nerve function of ASIA grade, clinical efficacy,improved degree of thoracic and lumbar lordosis,and bony fusion were compared between two groups.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 12 to 24 months with an average of (15.8 ± 3.3) months. The operation time, bleeding during operation, and postoperative drainage volume had no significant different between two groups (P > 0.05). As compared with preoperative, ASIA grade of two groups at last follow-up had statistically significantly different (P < 0.01), the neural function of two groups after operation was recovered for different extent. The JOA score of two groups was compared between last follow-up and preoperative, the difference had statistically significant (P < 0.01), the two groups showed good clinical effect. The clinical results of ASIA grade, JOA score and RIS had no significant differences between two groups. All patients of two groups were obtained fusion. Thoracic and lumbar lordosis angle improvement degree had no significant difference between two groups ,it bad significant difference had statistical significance compared with preoperative, the two approaches could effectively restore the spinal sequence.
Conclusion: 
For patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture just treated by anterior decompression and reconstruction of anterior column, according to the degree of operation performer' skill proficiency and the patient' condition to choose, but for patients must performed the spinal canal decompression anterior and posterior, the three column-reconstruction to required anterior-posterior approach, the posterior unilateral approach corpectomy fusion screw-rod fixation obviously shorten operation time, reduce the operation wound, it is worth the clinical promotion.},

  abstract={Background: 
Temporary unipedicle screw reduction with percutaneous kyphoplasty (TUSR-PKP) is a relatively new method for managing osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). A clinical retrospective comparative study was conducted to verify whether TUSR-PKP was noninferior to simple PKP regarding the management of OVCFs.
Methods: 
A total of 38 consecutive patients who sustained OVCFs without neurological deficits and had undergone surgeries in our hospital from June 2012 to January 2014 were included in the study: 24 patients underwent simple PKP (control group) and the other 14 patients underwent TUSR-PKP (treatment group). All 38 patients were asked to participate in a long-term (>1 year) follow-up. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were recorded, and the Cobb angles and the vertebral body heights were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and on day 1, as well as 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.
Results: 
The patients in the treatment group had better vertebral height gain and greater improvement on ODI compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The VAS scores of the two groups were similar at all points until the end of the 1‑year follow-up period. Two patients from the treatment group and 5 patients from the control group had cement leakage. In the control group, 3 patients suffered adjacent or nonadjacent vertebra fractures.
Conclusion: 
TUSR-PKP is a safe and effective surgical option for OVCFs. Compared with simple PKP, TUSR-PKP provided at least equal results for OVCFs. Moreover, during the postsurgery observations, TUSR-PKP showed potential advantages including vertebral height gain, ODI improvement, and fewer subsequent refractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical effects and radiographic outcomes of mini-open trans-spatium intermuscular and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation in treating thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fractures without neurological deficits.
Methods: 
From August 2009 and August 2012, 95 patients with thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fractures without neurological deficits were treated with short-segment pedicle fixation through mini-open trans-spatium intermuscular or percutaneous approach. There were 65 males and 30 females, aged from 16 to 60 years old with an average of 42 years. The mini-open trans-spatium intermuscular approach was used in 58 cases (group A) and the percutaneous approach was used in 37 cases (group B). Total incision length, operative time, intraoperative bleeding, fluoroscopy, hospitalization cost were compared between two groups. Visual analog scale (VAS) and radiographic outcomes were compared between two groups.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 12 to 36 months with an average of 19.6 months. No complications such as incision infection, internal fixation loosening and breakage were found. In group A, fluoroscopy time was short and hospitalization cost was lower than that of group B (P<0.05). But the total incision length in group B was smaller than that of group A (P<0.05). There was no significant differences in operative time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative VAS and radiographic outcomes between two groups (P>0.05). Postoperative VAS and radiographic outcomes were improved than that of preoperative (P<0.05).
Conclusion: 
The mini-open trans-spatium intermuscular and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation have similar clinical effects and radiographic outcomes in treating thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fractures without neurological deficits. However, in this study, the mini-open trans-spatium intermuscular approach has a short learning curve and more advantages in hospitalization cost and intraoperative radiation exposure times, and is recommendable.},

  abstract={Background: 
Thoracolumbar burst fractures are common clinical entity encountered in neurosurgical practice, accounting for 10-20% of all spinal fractures. Clinical picture could be devastating due to severe neurological deficits which lead the patients dependent both socially and emotionally.
Materials and methods: 
This study compared two groups of patients who were operated because of thoracolumbar burst fracture secondary to spinal trauma in terms of neurologic deficits, degree of improvement, and radiologic measurements at one-year follow-up. The first group (group I) included the patients who underwent posterior total laminectomy, peroperative reduction of intracanal bone fragments, and posterior spinal instrumentation and the second group (group II) included the patients who underwent total laminectomy, and spinal instrumentation without reduction of free bone fragments.
Results: 
Neither group showed significant correlation with any measurement parameter. Radiological assessments and clinical improvements did not disclosed significant difference between the two groups at one-year follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Retropulsion of free bone fragments extend the time of surgery and causes complications. This study found that there is no need to retropulse the bone fragments in the spinal canal in patients with unstable burst fractures who underwent total laminectomy and posterior long segment stabilization.},

  abstract={Object: 
The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of degeneration and need for subsequent fusion surgery between patients who were treated nonsurgically and patients treated with fusion after a diagnosis of thoracic-or lumbar-level fracture without degenerative disease.
Methods: 
The authors performed a retrospective study of Orthopedic United Healthcare patients diagnosed with thoracic or lumbar fracture. Patients were filtered into thoracic and lumbar fracture groups using diagnostic codes and then assigned to one of 2 treatment subgroups (fusion surgery or no surgery) on the basis of procedural codes. Disc degeneration and follow-up surgery were recorded. Chi-square statistical analysis was used.
Results: 
Of 3699 patients diagnosed with a thoracic fracture, 117 (3.2%) underwent thoracic fusion and 3215 (86.9%) were treated nonsurgically. Within 3 years, 147 (4.6%) patients from the nonsurgical subgroup and fewer than 11 (0.9%-8.5%) from the fusion subgroup were diagnosed with thoracic disc degeneration. From the nonsurgical subgroup, 11 (0.3%) patients underwent a thoracic surgery related to disc degeneration compared with zero from the fusion group (p > 0.05). Of 5016 patients diagnosed with lumbar fracture, 150 (3.0%) underwent fusion and 4371 (87.1%) had no surgery. Within 3 years, 503 patients (11.5%) from the nonsurgical subgroup and 35 (23.3%) from the fusion subgroup were diagnosed with lumbar disc degeneration (p < 0.05). From the nonsurgical subgroup, 42 (1.0%) went on to have surgery related to disc degeneration, compared with fewer than 11 (0.7%-6.7%) from the fusion subgroup (values not precise due to privacy limitations).
Conclusions: 
Fusion surgery for thoracic fracture does not appear to increase the likelihood of undergoing future surgery. In the lumbar region, initial fusion surgery appears to increase the incidence of disc degeneration and could potentially necessitate future surgeries.},

  abstract={The aim of the study was to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes between posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation combined with lateral-approach interbody fusion and traditional anterior-posterior (AP) surgery for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.Lateral-approach interbody fusion has achieved satisfactory results for thoracic and lumbar degenerative disease. However, few studies have focused on the use of this technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established. All patients who meet the above criteria were prospectively treated by posterior short-segment instrumentation and secondary-staged minimally invasive lateral-approach interbody fusion, and classified as group A. A historical group of patients who were treated by traditional wide-open AP approach was used as a control group and classified as group B. The radiological and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.There were 12 patients in group A and 18 patients in group B. The mean operative time and intraoperative blood loss of anterior reconstruction were significantly higher in group B than those in group A (127.1 ± 21.7 vs 197.5 ± 47.7 min, P < 0.01; 185.8 ± 62.3 vs 495 ± 347.4 mL, P < 0.01). Two of the 12 (16.7%) patients in group A experienced 2 surgical complications: 1 (8.3%) major and 1 (8.3%) minor. Six of the 18 (33%) patients in group B experienced 9 surgical complications: 3 (16.7%) major and 6 (33.3%) minor. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding loss of correction (4.3 ± 2.1 vs 4.2 ± 2.4, P = 0.89) and neurological function at final follow-up (P = 0.77). In both groups, no case of instrumentation failure, pseudarthrosis, or nonunion was noted.Compared with the wide-open AP surgery, posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation, combined with minimally invasive lateral-approach interbody fusion, can achieve similar clinical results with significant less operative time, blood loss, and surgical complication. This procedure seems to be a reasonable treatment option for selective patients with thoracolumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
A prospective cohort study evaluates the functional and radiological outcome of thoracolumbar spine fractures treated either with open or percutaneous dorsal instrumentation. In recent years, several studies advocate percutaneous stabilization of spinal fractures in patients without neurological deficits. However, it is still debated whether percutaneous stabilization is superior to open dorsal instrumentation in spinal trauma.
Material and methods: 
This study was performed between 2010 and 2012 at a Level 1 trauma center. Patients treated either with an open or a percutaneous dorsal instrumentation for traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (T11 to L2) were included. Fracture morphology, screw positioning and clinical parameters were analyzed. Standardized questionnaires (VAS-spine-score; Oswestry-disability-score; SF-36) and follow up radiographs were performed.
Results: 
Overall 72 patients (29 percutaneous; 43 open) could be included. The surgical and the early postsurgical course were similar between both groups. Furthermore the operative approach had no influence on the functional and radiological outcome one year after surgery, but the questionnaires showed moderate impairments within both groups. Also both groups showed a significant loss of reduction after the first postoperative month (p < 0.01). Within the open group a significantly higher amount of fracture reduction (p < 0.01) and a significantly reduced intraoperative radiation exposure was seen (open 105.9 sec.; percutaneous 143.1 sec; p < 0.05); whereas the percutaneous approach was associated with significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss (open 2.2 g/dl; percutaneous 1.2 g/dl; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
The functional and the radiological outcome of both groups was comparable one year after trauma. Minor advantages of the percutaneous system was less blood loss, whereas the open approach was associated with a significantly higher amount of initial reduction and significantly less intraoperative radiation exposure. Independent from the type of posterior fixation loss of reduction was already significant in the early postoperative course.},

Unique pathologies, such as osteoporosis and degenerative deformities, must be recognized and dealt with. Recent treatment options and recommendations for the medical optimization of bone health include vitamin D and calcium supplementation, diphosphonates, and teriparatide. Optimizing spinal fixation in elderly patients with osteoporosis is critical; cement augmentation of pedicle screws is promising. In the management of geriatric odontoid fractures, nonsurgical support with a collar may be considered for the low-demand patient, whereas surgical fixation is favored for high-demand patients. Management of degenerative deformity must address sagittal plane balance, including consideration of pelvic incidence. Various osteotomies may prove helpful in this setting.},

Thirty-two cases were treated with PFFV, and 35 cases were treated with traditional short-segment fixation (TSSF). All patients were periodically followed-up with clinical and radiologic evaluation. Cobb`s angle and vertebral body height were analyzed and compared, and the operational time, intra-operational blood loss, and the Denis pain scale scores were also compared.
Results: 
Compared with preoperative angles, the Cobb`s angles were reduced and the vertebral body height of the fractured vertebra was increased after operation at a statistically significant level. Twelve months post-operative, the loss of Cobb`s angle and vertebral body height in the PFFV group was significantly less than that in the TSSF group. There was no statistical significance in the Denis pain scale score 12 months post-operatively between the 2 groups.
Conclusion: 
Selective adoption of PFFV is helpful not only for stabilization of fractures and restoration of anatomy, but also maintaining the effectiveness of the restoration with good functional outcome.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The authors present clinical outcome data and satisfaction of patients who underwent minimally invasive vertebral body corpectomy and cage placement via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach and posterior short-segment instrumentation for lumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Patients with unstable lumbar burst fractures who underwent corpectomy and anterior column reconstruction via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach with short-segment posterior fixation were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic information, operative parameters, perioperative radiographic measurements, and complications were analyzed. Patient-reported outcome instruments (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]) and an anterior scar-specific patient satisfaction questionnaire were recorded at the latest follow-up.
Results: 
Twelve patients (7 men, 5 women, average age 42 years, range 22-68 years) met the inclusion criteria. Lumbar corpectomies with anterior column support were performed (L-1, n = 8; L-2, n = 2; L-3, n = 2) and supplemented with short-segment posterior instrumentation (4 open, 8 percutaneous). Four patients had preoperative neurological deficits, all of which improved after surgery. No new neurological complications were noted. The anterior incision on average was 6.4 cm (range 5-8 cm) in length, caused mild pain and disability, and was aesthetically acceptable to the large majority of patients. Three patients required chest tube placement for pleural violation, and 1 patient required reoperation for cage subsidence/hardware failure. Average clinical follow-up was 38 months (range 16-68 months), and average radiographic follow-up was 37 months (range 6-68 months). Preoperative lumbar lordosis and focal lordosis were significantly improved/maintained after surgery. Patients were satisfied with their outcomes, had minimal/moderate disability (average ODI score 20, range 0-52), and had good physical (SF-12 physical component score 41.7% ± 10.4%) and mental health outcomes (SF-12 mental component score 50.2% ± 11.6%) after surgery.
Conclusions: 
Anterior corpectomy and cage placement via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach supplemented by short-segment posterior instrumentation is a safe, effective alternative to conventional approaches in the treatment of single-level unstable burst fractures and is associated with excellent functional outcomes and patient satisfaction.},

  abstract={We investigated the clinical and radiological results of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation in the management of spinal trauma and metastatic tumours. A retrospective analysis was performed on a series of 14 patients who were operated on from March 2009 to November 2011 by a single surgeon (RJM). Following a radiological review (CT scan/MRI), six patients underwent short segment fixation, while the remaining underwent long segment fixation. All patients had routine follow-ups at 4, 6, 12months, and annually thereafter. Clinical examinations were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively, and the length of operation, blood loss, and postoperative pain relief were recorded. There was a single patient with an incision site complication. The mean blood loss was 269mL. All of the parameters demonstrated no significant differences between the trauma and the tumour groups (p=0.10). The neurological power scores improved for all patients, with the largest increase being from a score of 2 to 4. At follow-up, the majority of patients had returned to their previous activities and had reduced pain scores. One patient suffered high pain levels from other medical conditions that were not related to the operation. Minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation is a suitable option for patients with spinal tumours and fractures, with acceptable safety and efficacy in this small retrospective patient series. We have seen favourable results in our patients, who have experienced an increased quality of life following their surgery.},

  abstract={Despite extensive research on thoracolumbar fractures, controversy still exists about which approach is the most appropriate. Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately. The objective of study was to perform a systematic review of the effectiveness of the anterior and posterior approaches in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. We conducted searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library, searching for relevant trials up to August 2013 that compared anterior and posterior for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The key words "anterior," "posterior," "thoracolumbar fracture," "CCT," and "RCT" were used. We assessed all included literature by using the Cochrane handbook (version 5.1). The results were expressed as the mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk difference for dichotomous outcomes, with a 95% confidence interval, using RevMan version 5.2. There were 3 randomized controlled trials and 11 clinical controlled trials included. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between groups regarding Cobb angle, the Frankel scale, ASIA/JOA motor score, complications, and number of patients returning to work. Compared with the anterior approach, the posterior approach demonstrated superior canal decompression. In the burst fracture subgroup, operative times were significantly shorter and perioperative blood loss was less in the posterior approach group. The posterior approach is more effective for canal decompression, operative times, and perioperative blood loss. However, because of the lack of randomized controlled trials, and because of large sample size studies, heterogeneity was significant between reports. The optimal treatment for thoracolumbar fractures requires further study.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Case-control study.
Objective: 
To investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of pedicle screw removal after successful fusion of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Implant removal is a common procedure in orthopedic surgery, although the benefits of and indications for removal remain controversial. Previous studies on pedicle screw removal have reported conflicting outcomes, because the study subjects and surgical goals were heterogeneous in nature.
Methods: 
We studied 45 consecutive patients who underwent implant removal and a control cohort of 45 age- and sex-matched patients who retained their spinal implants after successful posterior fusion of thoracolumbar burst fractures using pedicle screw instrument. In most cases, long-segment instrumentation with short-segment posterior fusion was performed. The mean elapsed period prior to implant removal after index fracture surgery was 18.3 ± 17.6 months. A visual analogue scale for back pain was applied, the Oswestry disability index calculated, and radiological parameters derived at the time of implant removal and 1 and 2 years postoperatively obtained. These data were compared with those of the control group evaluated at the same times after index fracture surgery.
Results: 
Patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, fracture morphologies, and the outcomes of index fracture surgery were similar between the 2 groups. The mean visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index scores were better at both the 1- and 2-year follow-ups in the implant removal group than in the control group (all P values = 0.000). The segmental motion angle of the implant removal group was 1.6° ± 1.5° at the time of implant removal, and increased significantly to 5.8° ± 3.9° at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.000), and was maintained at this level at the 2-year follow-up (5.9° ± 4.1°) (P = 0.000).
Conclusion: 
In patients treated successfully for thoracolumbar burst fractures, pedicle screw removal is beneficial because it alleviates pain and disability. Restoration of the segmental motion angle after implant removal may contribute to the clinical improvement.
Level of evidence: 
3.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The treatment of fractures involving the lumbar spine has been controversial. Laminae lesion may be complete or of the greenstick type (incomplete). Dural tears and nerve root entrapment may accompany these laminae fractures. The aim of this study is twofold, to assess the effect of different types of laminae fractures on the anteriorvertebral height restoration in upper lumbar burst fractures and to determine the incidences of the intraoperatively detected dural tear and neural entrapment in complete and incomplete laminae fractures to choose the optimal treatment.
Materials and methods: 
A retrospective review was conducted on 112 patients with 114 lumbar burst fractures treated operatively, age ranged from 17 to 55 years (mean age 32). Male to female ratio was (93%/7%), 8 females. Patients were divided into three groups, group 1 patients without lamina fracture, group 2 patients with complete type lamina fracture and group 3 patients with (percutaneous) incomplete type lamina fractures. All clinical charts and radiologic data of these groups were analyzed for their association with dural tears, neural entrapment and the impact of lamina fracture (complete and incomplete types) on the efficacy of anterior vertebral height restoration. The severity of injury was determined using the ASIA (Modified Frankel scale).
Results: 
Out of 114 upper lumbar burst fractures, lamina fracture occurred in 34 patients (29.8%), complete lamina fracture occurred in 21 patients (61.7%), whereas incomplete lamina fracture occurred in 13 patients (38.3%). Dural tear was detected in 16 patients (47%) and was predominantly higher in complete type lamina fracture 12 patients (57%) when compared to 4 dural tears (30%) in incomplete lamina fractures. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference in the preoperative anterior vertebral height loss and local kyphotic angle between the three groups. However the anterior vertebral height and local kyhpotic angle restoration were found to be affected by the presence of complete lamina fracture when compared to other groups with incomplete lamina fracture and without lamina fracture (P=0.001).
Conclusion: 
In upper lumbar burst fractures, complete lamina fracture is an indicator of injury severity. When detected preoperatively on CT or MRI scanning, it should be operated by open book laminectomy even if the patient is neurologically intact since it carries a high risk of neural entrapment, and its presence affects the intraoperative postural and instrumental trials for anterior vertebral height restoration.},

To evaluate and compare the long-term outcome of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated using anterior, posterior or combined anterior and posterior approaches.
Methods: 
The prospective randomised controlled study was conducted at the Tianjin 4th Centre Hospital, Tianjin, China, and comprised patients of unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture operated between July 2004 and July 2006 and followed up for five years. The patients were divided randomly into three groups of anterior, posterior and combined anterior and posterior approaches. Clinical data was analysed using SPSS 17.
Results: 
Of the 66 cases in the study, 45 (68.18%) were male and 21 (31.8%) were female, with overall age ranging from 19 to 69 years. There were 22 (33.3%) patients in the anterior group, 23 (35%) in the posterior group, and 21 (32%) in the combined anterior and posterior group. Comparison was made between two respective groups. The combined group was found to have the longest operation time (p < 0.02; p < 0.01, respectively), larger blood loss (p < 0.006; p < 0.005, respectively), longer hospital stay (p < 0.01; p < 0.003, respectively) and higher hospitalisation costs (p < 0.004; p < 0.001, respectively). The postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly smaller than preoperative one in all groups (p < 0.01; p < 0.02; p < 0.01).
Conclusion: 
The anterior approach or combined anterior and posterior approach were better options in managing unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture, while the latter should be used only for the burst fracture with a significant posterior column injury.},

  abstract={Background: 
Two different techniques of short-segment instrumentation, with and without a pedicle screw at the fracture level, were compared in thoracolumbar burst fractures in neurologically intact (ASIA-E) patients. The sagittal index, kyphosis angle (Cobb), canal compromise ratio, and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height were analyzed.
Methods: 
Seventy patients who underwent short-segment stabilization for thoracolumbar (T11-L2) burst fractures in our clinic between 2008 and 2012 were included in this retrospective study. In 35 patients (group 1), a pedicle screw was placed only one level down and one level up from the fracture level. In another 35 patients (group 2), a screw was placed at the fracture level in addition to the short segment. Only neurologically intact patients with burst fractures according to the Denis classification were included. The patients were evaluated according to their age/gender, trauma etiology, and fracture level. Their preoperative and most recent postoperative follow-up radiographs and CTs were evaluated in terms of the sagittal index, kyphosis angle (Cobb), ratio of canal compromise, and anterior vertebral height.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in their ages, follow-up periods, and severity of the deformity and fracture. When the pedicle screw was placed at the fracture level in addition to short-segment stabilization, statistically significant improvements in the sagittal index (p < 0.001), local kyphosis (Cobb) angle (p = 0.006), and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height (p = 0.002) were observed. Concerning the ratio of canal compromise according to the CT findings (p = 0.189), moderate differences were found.
Conclusions: 
Short-segment stabilization in thoracolumbar burst fractures with additional screws at the level of the fracture results in an improved kyphosis correction, sagittal index, and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height. However, long-term follow-up is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
There is a high incidence of vertebral burst fractures following low velocity trauma in the elderly. Treatment of unstable vertebral burst fractures using the same principles like in stable vertebral burst fractures may show less favourable results in terms of fracture reduction, maintenance of reduction and cement leakage. In order to address these shortcomings this study introduces cementless fixation of unstable vertebral burst fractures using internal fixators and expandable intravertebral titanium mesh cages in a one-stage procedure via minimum-invasive techniques.
Material and methods: 
A total of 16 consecutive patients (median age 76 years, range 58-94) with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures and concomitant osteoporosis were treated by an internal fixator inserted via minimum invasive technique one level above and below the fractured vertebra. Fracture reduction was achieved and maintained by transpedicular placement of two titanium mesh cages into the fractured vertebral body during the same procedure. Intra- and postoperative safety of the procedure as well as analysis of reduction quality was analysed by 3D C-arm imaging or CT, respectively. Clinical and radiographic follow-up averaged 10.4 months (range 4.5-24.5).
Results: 
Stabilization of the collapsed vertebral body was achieved in all 16 cases without any intraoperative complication. Surgical time averaged 102 ± 6.6 minutes (71-194). The postoperative kyphotic angle (KA) and Cobb angle revealed significant improvements (KA 13.7° to 7.4°, p < 0.001; Cobb 9.6° to 6.0°, p < 0.002) with partial loss of reduction at final follow-up (KA 8.3°, Cobb 8.7°). VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) improved from 7.6 to 2.6 (p < 0.001). Adjacent fractures were not observed. One minor (malposition of pedicle screw) complication was encountered.
Conclusion: 
Cementless fixation of osteoporotic burst fractures revealed substantial pain relief, adequate maintenance of reduction and a low complication rate. Bony healing after unstable osteoporotic burst fractures is possible.

  abstract={Introduction: 
The last decade has seen the emergence of minimally invasive spine surgery. However, there is still no consensus on whether percutaneous osteosynthesis (PO) or open surgery (OS) is more cost-effective in treatment of traumatic fractures and degenerative lesions. The objective of this study is to compare the clinical results and hospitalization costs of OS and PO for degenerative lesions and thoraco-lumbar fractures.
Methods: 
This cost-minimization study was performed in patients undergoing OS or PO on a 36-month period. Patient data, surgical and clinical results, as well as cost data were collected and analyzed. The financial costs were calculated based on diagnosis related group reimbursement and the French national cost scale, enabling the evaluation of charges for each hospital stay.
Results: 
46 patients were included in this cost analysis, 24 patients underwent OS and 22 underwent PO. No significant difference was found between surgical groups in terms of patient's clinical features and outcomes during the patient hospitalization. The use of PO was significantly associated with a decrease in Length Of Stay (LOS). The cost-minimization revealed that PO is associated with decreased hospital charges and shorten LOS for patients, with similar clinical outcomes and medical device cost to OS.
Conclusions: 
This medico-economic study has leaded to choose preferentially the use of minimally invasive surgery techniques. This study also illustrates the discrepancy between the national health system reimbursement and real hospital charges. The medico-economic is becoming critical in the current context of sustainable health resource allocation.},

  abstract={Object: 
To investigate what benefits can be derived from a shorter construct length in the pedicle screw based surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture (TLBF).
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was performed of clinical notes and radiology for patients who underwent surgical fixation of TLBFs between 2007 and 2012 in a single UK institution. Constructs either fixed the vertebra above the fracture to the vertebra below (short segment fixation - SSF) or fixed the vertebra above to the relatively well-preserved pedicles and inferolateral portions of the bodies of the fractured vertebra (mono-segment fixation - MSF). 11 patients in each group were included and length of operation, postoperative opiate use, time to mobilisation and length of hospital stay were recorded. Anterior vertebral height loss (AVHL) was measured from sagittal reconstructions of CT imaging and lateral radiographs.
Results: 
The mean operation time was 169 ± 10.4 min in the MSF group compared to 227 ± 13.3 minin the SSF group (p = 0.0028). Mean postoperative opiate use was 50.4 ± 17.9 mg in the MSF group compared to 126.6 ± 64.6 mgs in the SSF group (p = 0.3088, ns). Mean time to mobilisation was 1.3 ± 0.2 in the MSF group and 3.4 ± 1.3 in the SSF group (p = 0.1031, ns). There were no significant differences in progression of anterior vertebral height loss or hospital stay between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
MSF for TLBFs is associated with shorter operative times than SSF. Strong trends are also demonstrated to quicker mobilisation, and lower opiate use. These advantages of a shorter construct length may result in cost saving and echo the advantages claimed by others for reducing spinal exposure in minimally invasive spinal surgery.},

  abstract={Background: 
In spite of the established benefits of anterolateral decompression and instrumentation (ALDI) for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF), the indications for supplementary posterior instrumentation remain unclear.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of clinical and radiographic data of a prospective cohort of 73 patients who underwent ALDI for TLBF from T12 to L4.
Results: 
The mean age of the cohort was 42 ± 15 years, with 49 males and 24 females. Forty-six patients had neurological deficit, and 27 were intact. Owing to symptomatic settling, supplemental posterior instrumentation was performed in 7 out of 73 patients. The age of patients requiring supplemental posterior instrumentation (59 ± 14 years) exceeded that of patients who did not (41 ± 16, p=0.004). Otherwise, the patients who required posterior instrumentation were comparable to those treated with ALDI in terms of body mass index (BMI), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores on admission and follow-up, residual spinal canal, and local kyphosis on admission and follow-up. The posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) integrity was assessed in 38 patients in whom the MRI scans were retrievable, 31 successfully treated with ALDI, and all 7 undergoing supplementary posterior instrumentation. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in the incidence of PLC disruption between the 2 groups (p=0.257).
Conclusions: 
Secondary supplemental posterior instrumentation was deemed necessary in 10% of cases following ALDI. Age was the only significant risk factor predicating supplemental posterior instrumentation.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The aim of the study is to use an algorithm previously published to decide whether to perform open surgery or percutaneous surgery with short fixation in patients with thoraco-lumbar junction and lumbar spine fractures, and to compare retrospectively surgical and conservative options of treatment.
Methods: 
Between 2005 and 2009, two groups of 25 patients were analyzed to compare retrospectively surgical and conservative option of treatment to assess perception of pain and to evaluate quality of life during treatment, to evaluate how quickly patients return to work and to their daily activities, to evaluate patients' satisfaction. X-ray controls were performed to evaluate the fusion rate at 3 and 6 months and CT scans at 6 months.
Results: 
The surgical group had a better functional recovery, a better quality of life and returned to work earlier in comparison to the conservative group.
Conclusions: 
We can conclude that the percutaneous procedure seems to give better results in terms of satisfaction and return to normal activities, although both procedures guarantee excellent fusion rates.},

  abstract={The optimum management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is cause for much debate in the literature. Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches are increasingly used in the management of degenerative spinal pathology, their role in treating burst fractures is unknown. Assessing the level of evidence (LOE) for use of MIS approaches in vertebral burst fractures may impart better understanding of how to integrate MIS in the treatment schema for these fractures. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE for all articles published on traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures through to July 2013. LOE was assigned according to the standards set forth by the Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research and the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. Full texts were reviewed to select only those articles discussing MIS approaches as a treatment modality. A total of 501 articles met both inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 403 of those were published within the past two decades. Among those, 35 articles detailed the use of MIS approaches in the management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. Only three studies provided high LOE: one level 1 study and two level 2 studies. Thirteen studies described the use of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, but all were level 4 or level 5 studies. Currently, the LOE for utilization of MIS approaches to manage traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is low. Further work in the form of prospective randomized controlled trials is needed to ascertain how MIS may be integrated into the treatment scheme for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

Summary of background data: 
since 2002, several dynamic pedicle fixation (DPF) systems have been developed with the aim to stabilize the spine without the undesirable effects of rigid lumbar spine fixation. Nearly ten years later, there are several studies on these dynamic systems.
Methods: 
A systematic review was done in MEDLINE/PubMED, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Trials and Google Scholar to assess the quality of published literature and the available studied outcomes in randomized controlled trials of DPF.
Results: 
Only three papers described randomized trials studying DPF. One of them focused on protection of adjacent level disease provided by DPF.
Conclusion: 
It was not possible to reveal any evidence for benefits using DPF compared to rigid fixation in surgery for lumbar spine.},

  abstract={Background: 
Short-segment U-shaped pedicle screw fixation has been widely used to treat thoracolumbar burst fracture. Some studies have reported the disadvantages of traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, which included a relatively high rate of adjacent segment degeneration and screw failure, including screw pullout and breakage. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of open reduction and fixation using KumaFix fixation system in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
From June 2011 to June 2012, 45 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with KumaFix (the treatment group, n = 23) or traditional U-shaped pedicle screw (the control group, n = 22). The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiologic and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb angle and vertebral wedge angle. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Questionnaire.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 9 to 22 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The operation time in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Preoperative Cobb angles and vertebral wedge angles in two groups were significantly decreased after surgery, and these have been well maintained at the last follow-up with mild correction losses. The results of clinical outcome showed lower VAS and ODI scores in two groups compared with those preoperative, and the treatment group had greater improvement on the ODI compared with the control group at the last follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Compared with traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, KumaFix fixation system can achieve gradual, controlled reduction, provide enough space for bone implantation, and avoid acceleration of adjacent segment degeneration. It is an effective and reliable technique to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the security of pedicle screw fixation in fractured vertebra in treatment of thoracolumbar fractures by comparing with routine fixation cross fractured vertebra.
Methods: 
A total of 101 cases of single segmental thoracolumbar fracture were selected between June 2008 and June 2011. Of them, 56 cases underwent pedicle screw fixation in fractured vertebra (group A), and 45 cases received routine fixation cross fractured vertebra (group B). There was no significant difference in gender, age, causes of injury, fracture type, fracture segment, Frankel grading, time of injury to operation, and the preoperative anterior vertebral height compression ratio and the canal occupation rate between 2 groups (P > 0.05). There were 34 cases of junction fracture of pedicle and vertebra (type I), 2 cases of pedicle waist fracture (type II), and 20 cases of junction fracture of pedicle and lamina (type III) in group A. The position of fractured vertebral pedicle screw was observed; the anterior vertebral height compression ratio, canal occupation rate, and surgical complications were compared between 2 groups.
Results: 
A total of 103 pedicle screws were placed in 54 patients of group A, except 2 patients of type II fracture; 96 screws were placed in the bone cortex completely and 7 screws deviated. The operation time of group A was significantly longer than that of group B (t = 4.339, P = 0.000), but there was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss between 2 groups (t = -0.089, P = 0.929). All 101 patients were followed up 6-16 months (mean, 8.5 months). The patients of 2 groups achieved nerve functional recovery. Fixation-related complications occurred in 1 case of 2 groups respectively, showing no significant difference (P = 1.000). At last follow-up, according to Denis lumbago classification, 51 cases were rated as P1 level and 5 cases as P2 level in group A; 35 cases were rated as P1 level, 8 cases as P2 level, and 2 cases as P3 level in group B; and there was no significant difference between 2 groups (Z = -1.836, P = 0.066). There was no significant difference between 2 groups in canal occupation rate at immediate after operation and at last follow-up (P > 0.05), and in the anterior vertebral height compression ratio at immediate after operation (P > 0.05), but the anterior vertebral height compression ratio of group B was significantly higher that of group A at last follow-up (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Single segmental thoracolumbar fracture treated by pedicle screw fixation in fractured vertebra through posterior approach is safe and feasible according to different pedicle fracture types to guide fixation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Many surgical methods are available for repairing thoracolumbar fractures including short-segment internal fixation with posterior pedicle screws and anterior decompression and reduction. However, most methods are associated with significant surgical trauma and long postoperative recovery. The purpose of this study was to describe anterior single level interbody fusion and fixation for the repair of thoracolumbar fractures which may reduce surgical trauma and help speed recovery.
Methods: 
A group of 21 patients who underwent single level anterior interbody fusion and fixation from June 2006 to June 2011 were compared with a group of 21 patients who underwent double level anterior interbody fusion and fixation during the same period. The groups were compared with regard to operation time, intraoperative blood loss, fracture healing time, ratio of pre- to postoperative endplate height between adjacent vertebrae, Cobb angle in the sagittal plane, recovery of neural function, and internal fusion failure.
Results: 
The 2 groups were similar with the exception of fracture location (P=0.017). The patients who underwent the single level procedure had a shorter operation time (P < 0.001), less blood loss (P < 0.001), and shorter follow-up (P < 0.001). Both groups had significant improvement in Cobb angle at 1 week and 1 year after surgery, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Both groups also exhibited improvement in neurological function, and the difference in improvement between the groups was not significant.
Conclusions: 
Single level intervertebral fusion and internal fixation for thoracolumbar fractures provides as satisfactory an outcome as the traditional approach, double level anterior interbody fusion and fixation, and reduces the degree of surgical trauma.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To identify the negative effect on treatment results of reserving damaged intervertebral discs when treating type B and type C spinal fracture-dislocations through a one-stage posterior approach.
Methods: 
This is a retrospective review of 53 consecutive patients who were treated in our spine surgery center from January 2005 to May 2012 due to severe thoracolumbar spinal fracture-dislocation. The patients in Group A (24 patients) underwent long-segment instrumentation laminectomy with pedicle screw-rod fixators for neural decompression. In Group B (29 patients), the patients underwent long-segment instrumentation laminectomy with pedicle screw-rod fixators for neural decompression evacuating of the ruptured disc and inserting of a bone graft into the evacuated disc space for interbody fusion. The mean time between injury and operation was 4.1 days (range 2-15 days). The clinical, radiologic and complication outcomes were analyzed retrospectively.
Results: 
Periodic follow-ups were carried out until an affirmative union or treatment failure took place. A progressive kyphosis angle larger than 10°, loss of disc height, pseudoarthrosis, recurrence of dislocation or subluxation, or instrument failure before fusion were considered treatment failures. Treatment failures were detected in 13 cases in Group A (failure rate was 54.2%). In Group B, there were 28 cases in which definitive bone fusion was demonstrated on CT scans, and CT scans of the other cases demonstrated undefined pseudoarthrosis without hardware failure. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups (p<0.001 chi-square test). The neurologic recoveries, assessed by the ASIA scoring system, were not satisfactory for the neural deficit patients in either group, indicating there was no significant difference with regard to neurologic recovery between the two groups (p>0.05 Fisher's exact test).
Conclusion: 
Intervertebral disc damage is a common characteristic in type B and C spinal fracture-dislocation injuries. The damaged intervertebral disc should be removed and substituted with a bone graft because reserving the damaged disc in situ increases the risk of treatment failure.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw (SSPI+IS) on the radiological outcome of type A thoracolumbar fractures, as judged by the load-sharing classification, percentage canal area reduction and remodelling. We retrospectively evaluated 39 patients who had undergone hyperlordotic SSPI+IS for an AO-Magerl Type-A thoracolumbar fracture. Their mean age was 35.1 (16 to 60) and the mean follow-up was 22.9 months (12 to 36). There were 26 men and 13 women in the study group. In total, 18 patients had a load-sharing classification score of seven and 21 a score of six. All radiographs and CT scans were evaluated for sagittal index, anterior body height compression (%ABC), spinal canal area and encroachment. There were no significant differences between the low and high score groups with respect to age, duration of follow-up, pre-operative sagittal index or pre-operative anterior body height compression (p = 0.217, 0.104, 0.104, and 0.109 respectively). The mean pre-operative sagittal index was 19.6° (12° to 28°) which was corrected to -1.8° (-5° to 3°) post-operatively and 2.4° (0° to 8°) at final follow-up (p = 0.835 for sagittal deformity). No patient needed revision for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation. Hyperlordotic reduction and short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw is a safe and effective method of treating burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. It gives excellent radiological results with a very low rate of failure regardless of whether the fractures have a high or low load-sharing classification score.},

The purpose of study was to evaluate the clinical results of early stabilization of spine fractures in polytrauma patients.
Materials and methods: 
Between August 2003, and May 2012, 166 polytrauma patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to injury-to-operation time (time cut-off, 72 hours). Patients were also subdivided into 4 groups according to injury severity score (ISS), and the clinical course was evaluated.
Results: 
Group A showed shorter hospital length of stay, intensive care unit, and ventilator days than group B. For each of these categories, the differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (P=.004, P=.044, and P=.043). Patients with moderate to severe injury (ISS, ≥26), those who were treated with early stabilization showed shorter hospital length of stay, intensive care unit, and ventilator days than the patients with mild to moderate injury (ISS, <26), and the differences were statistically significant (P=.004, P=.006, and P=.006).
Conclusion: 
Polytrauma patients whose spine fractures were stabilized within 72 hours had better clinical outcomes than those with late stabilization. In addition, more severely injured patients (ISS, ≥26) benefited more from early stabilization.},

To compare the clinical effects of injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation and injured vertebra bone grafting in treating thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective study was performed on 48 patients with single thoracolumbar fractures (type A3) from August 2008 to August 2010. Twenty-four patients were treated with injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation (group A) and 24 were treated with injured vertebra bone grafting (group B). There were 14 males and 10 females with an average age of (44.0 +/- 7.4) years old (34 to 56) in group A and there were 13 males and 11 females with an average age of (42.5 +/- 7.1) years(ranged, 31 to 54) in group B. Operation time, volume of blood loss, complications and the relative parameter of imageology were compared between two groups.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in gender,age, position of injury, volume of blood loss between two groups. Operation time of group A was shorter than that of group B. Cobb angle and injured vertebral height obviously improved at the immediately postoperatively between two groups; there was no significant difference in group A between the immediately and three months postoperatively, but there was significant difference in group B; there was no significant difference between three months and one year postoperatively in two groups. The failure rate of group B was significantly higher than that of group A.
Conclusion: 
Pedicle screw fixation in the injured vertebrae has advantage of short operation time,can obtain satisfactory effects and is better than injured vertebra bone grafting in maintaining the reduction in treating single thoracolumbar fractures.},

Between March 2006 and May 2012, a retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 48 cases of severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with more than 50% collapse of the anterior vertebral body or more than 400 of sagittal angulation, which were treated by LSF-VP in 27 cases (LSF-VP group) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in 21 cases (PKP group). All patients suffered from single thoracolumbar vertebral compressive fracture at T11 to L2. There was no significant difference in gender, age, spinal segment, and T values of bone mineral density between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The effectiveness of the treatment was appraised by visual analogue scale (VAS), Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, height of anterior/posterior vertebral body, and compressive ratio of vertebrae before and after operations.
Results: 
The LSF-VP group had longer operation time, hospitalization days, and more bone cement injection volume than the PKP group, showing significant differences (P < 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss in LSF-VP group ranged from 220 to 1,050 mL (mean, 517 mL). No pulmonaryor cerebral embolism or cerebrospinal fluid leakage was found in both groups. Asymptomatic bone cement leakage was found in 3 cases of LSF-VP group and 2 cases of PKP group. The patients were followed up for 16-78 months (mean, 41.1 months) in LSF-VP group, and 12-71 months (mean, 42.1 months) in PKP group. No fixation failure such as loosened or broken pedicle screw was found in LSF-VP group during the follow-up, and no re-fracture or adjacent vertebral body fracture was found. Two cases in PKP group at 39 and 56 months after operation respectively were found to have poor maintenance of vertebral height and loss of rectification (Cobb angle was more than 40 degrees) with recurrence of pain, which were treated by second surgery of LSF-VP; another case had compressive fracture of the adjacent segment and thoracolumbar kyphosis at 16 months after operation, which was treated by second surgery of LSF-VP. There were significant differences in the other indexes between each pair of the three time points (P < 0.05), except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, and the height of posterior vertebral body between discharge and last follow-up in LSF-VP group, and except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis and compressive ratio of bertebrae between discharge and last follow-up in PKP group (P > 0.05). After operation, the other indexes of LSF-VP group were significantly better than those of PKP group at each time point (P < 0.05), except the VAS score and the height of posterior vertebral body at discharge (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The effectiveness of LSF-VP is satisfactory in treating severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with kyphosis deformity. LSF-VP can acquire better rectification of kyphosis and recovery of vertebral body height than PKP.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of reinforcing short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in restoring vertebral body height and preventing loss of correction in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
This retrospective study was carried out from the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China. Forty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit were operatively treated between July 2008 and June 2011. Patients in group A (n=21) were treated by short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting, whereas patients in group B (n=25) were treated by short-segment fixation without bone grafting. The preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up radiographs (anterior, middle, posterior vertebral height, and local kyphosis angle) were evaluated.
Results: 
All 46 patients in both groups obtained satisfactory reduction of fractured vertebrae. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups according to the improvement of body height and local kyphosis angle. However, correction losses were observed in both groups. Less losses of anterior body height (p=0.0007), middle body height (p<0.0001), and local kyphosis angle (p=0.0447) were detected in group A than group B. The rate of failure in group A (4.8%) was significantly lower than that in group B (28.0%) (p=0.0383).
Conclusion: 
Reinforcement of short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting can effectively restore vertebral body height and prevent loss of correction for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
The main aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after stabilization by a percutaneous transpedicular system and stabilization from the standard open approach for thoracolumbar spine injury.
Methods: 
Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in the study over a period of 16 months. Patients were included in the study if they experienced 1 thoracolumbar fracture (A3.1-A3.3, according to the AO/Magerl classification), had an absence of neurological deficits, had no other significant injuries, and were willing to participate. Eighteen patients were treated by short-segment, minimally invasive, percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. The control group was composed of 19 patients who were stabilized using a short-segment transpedicular construct, which was performed through a standard midline incision. The pain profile was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS), and overall satisfaction by a simple 4-stage scale relating to performance of daily activities. Working ability and return to original occupation were also monitored. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), vertebral body angle (VBA), and bisegmental Cobb angle. The accuracy of screw placement was examined using CT.
Results: 
The mean surgical duration in the percutaneous screw group was 53 ± 10 minutes, compared with 60 ± 9 minutes in the control group (p = 0.032). The percutaneous screw group had a significantly lower perioperative blood loss of 56 ± 17 ml, compared with 331 ± 149 ml in the control group (p < 0.001). Scores on the VAS in patients in the percutaneous screw group during the first 7 postoperative days were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in VBI, VBA, and Cobb angle values during follow-up. There was no significant difference in screw placement accuracy between the groups and no patients required surgical revision. There was no significant difference between groups in overall satisfaction at the 2-year follow-up (p = 0.402). Working ability was insignificantly better in the percutaneous screw group; previous working position was achieved in 17 patients in this group and in 12 cases in the control group (p = 0.088).
Conclusions: 
This study confirms that the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique represents a viable option in the treatment of preselected thoracolumbar fractures. A significant reduction in blood loss, postoperative pain, and surgical time were the main advantages associated with this minimally invasive technique. Clinical, functional, and radiological results were at least the same as those achieved using the open technique after a 2-year follow-up. The short-term benefits of the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique are apparent, and long-term results have to be studied in other well-designed studies evaluating the theoretical benefit of the percutaneous technique and assessing whether the results of the latter are as durable as the ones achieved by open surgery.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacies of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra plus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Between June 2008 and September 2010, a total of 46 patients with fractures of thoracolumbar junction, whose scores of load sharing classification (LSC) ranging from 5 to 7, underwent the combined treatment of SSPI and fracture level pedicle screw at our department. They were divided into 2 groups. Group I included 25 patients undergoing SSPI plus unilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (5 screws) while Group II included 21 patients had SSPI plus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (6 screws). The data of anterior body height compression (AVHC), sagittal Cobb's angle, internal fixation failure, restoration of nervous function, visual analogue score (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were analyzed.
Results: 
The groups were similar with regards to age, gender, LSC, AVHC and sagittal Cobb's angle preoperatively. Blood loss volume and operative duration were less in the Group I (109.2 ± 30.68 vs 110.0 ± 32.06 min, t = -0.086, P > 0.05 and 376.0 ± 303.1 vs 409.5 ± 361.1 ml, t = -0.342, P > 0.05). They were followed up for a minimum period of 12 months. In follow-up period was 17.48 ± 4.14 months in Group I versus 18.33 ± 4.31 months in Group II (t = -0.683, P > 0.05). All patients with initial partial neurologic deficits improved at the final follow-up. Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra plus SSPI is an excellent surgical therapeutic choice for patients with a LSC range of 5-7 thoraclumbar fractures. The efficacies of unilateral and bilateral pedicle screw fixation at fracture level are the same.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the medium and long-term outcomes of lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior versus posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
A total of 47 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were divided into 2 groups according to surgical approaches. Group A underwent lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior approach while group B had posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression and reconstruction of spine. During a follow-up period of 36-68 months, their clinical and radiological outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. The perioperative volume of blood loss, operative duration, complications, pulmonary functions, Frankel scale and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores were recorded and analyzed. And the heights of anterior edge of vertebral body and Cobb angle were examined for radiological outcomes.
Results: 
At the latest follow-up, all patients achieved solid fusion with significant neurological improvements. The perioperative volumes of blood loss were less, operative duration was shorter and postoperative pulmonary functions were better in the group B (P < 0.05). The ASIA motor score and radiological outcomes were not significantly different at all timepoints between two groups (P < 0.05). But the neurological functions of two groups improved by approximately 1.4 Frankel grade (group A) versus 1.41 (group B) at the final follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior and posterior approaches with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine are adequate surgical treatments for thoracolumbar burst fractures. But the latter has the major advantages of less perioperative volume of blood loss, fewer complications, shorter operative duration and better pulmonary functions.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the clinical outcome of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws through paraspinal muscle sparing approach to treat thoracolumbar fractures, and to discuss its advantages.
Methods: 
From August 2010 to June 2012, we had 40 thoracolumber fractures patients (27 males and 13 females). Their ages ranged from 22 to 60 years. Of the 40 cases, 4 were T11 fractures, 13 T12 fractures ,17 L1 fractures,6 L2 fractures. According to Denis classification,all of them were burst fractures, with vertebral canal compromise less than 1/3. According to AO classification they were type A or type B1 injuries. All the cases had no nerve injury. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. With Group A (20 cases) we took the method of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to fix one level above and below the injured vertebra through the parespinal muscle sparing approach. With Group B (20 cases), we took the traditional posterior midline approach and open procedure. Then we compared the two groups by operation time, blood loss, drainage, Visual Analogue Scales and X-ray exposure.
Results: 
Minimal invasive group had obvious advatages in operation time, bleeding control and early pain relief of post-operation. The X-ray exposure and long-term follow-up outcome were almost the same.
Conclusion: 
Through paraspinal muscle sparing approach minimal invasive internal fixtation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to treat thoracolumber has more advantages than traditional procedure in blood control and quick recovery. The method needs no special instruments and don't increase X-ray exposure.},

  abstract={Background: 
The treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures is controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare intermediate-segment (IS) and long-segment (LS) instrumentation in the treatment for these fractures.
Methods: 
IS instrumentation was considered as pedicle fixation two levels above and one level below the fractured vertebra (infra-laminar hooks attached to lower vertebra with pedicle screws). LS instrumentation was done two levels above and two levels below the fractured vertebra. Among a total of 25 consecutive patients, Group 1 included ten patients treated by IS pedicle fixation, whereas Group 2 included fifteen patients treated by LS instrumentation.
Results: 
The measurements of local kyphosis (p = 0.955), sagittal index (p = 0.128), anterior vertebral height compression (p = 0.230) and canal diameter expansion (p = 0.839) demonstrated similar improvement at the final follow-up between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between Group 1 and Group 2 regarding clinical outcome [Hannover scoring system, Oswestry disability questionnaire and the range of motion of the lumbar region compared to neutral (0°)].
Conclusions: 
The radiographic parameters were the same between the two groups. However, the clinical parameters demonstrated that IS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

By analyzing a large number of surgical patients, we identified the roles of wedge-shaped changes in related surgeries.
Objectives: 
To illustrate the relevance of vertebral wedge-shaped changes in X-ray imaging at supine and standing positions in patients with percutaneous kyphoplasty as well as the postoperative effect.
Setting: 
All patient data were collected from a hospital in China.
Methods: 
Between June 2006 and May 2010, 77 surgical patients (9 men and 68 women) with wedge-shaped compression fractures were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into group A (ΔWR2.5%) and group B (ΔWR<2.5%) according to the dynamic changes in the percentage of vertebral body wedge-shaped variable ratio (WR) at supine and standing positions. The intensity of back pain in different positions pre- and postoperatively was evaluated with a visual analog pain scale (VAS).
Results: 
The WRs in both standing and supine positions were significantly reduced by kyphoplasty in both groups A and B. In agreement with the improvement in WRs, the VAS was significantly decreased in three positions for patients in group A and in turning over and standing position for patients in group B. With respect to ΔWR changes, group B revealed significantly lower values compared with group A preoperatively (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference between groups A and B postoperatively and at 1-month follow-up (P=0.179 and P=0.558, respectively).
Conclusions: 
Improvement in symptoms after kyphoplasty is better in patients with wedge-shaped changes in supine and standing positions, and the efficacy of height restoration of the spine would be better in unstable vertebrae by balloon dilatation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The posterior rim separation of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae has been ascribed to various mechanisms. The procedure of operative treatment is still controversial. The authors' objective was to study the therapeutic methods of posterior vertebral rim separation.
Methods: 
Thirty-four patients, including 23 males and 11 females whose ages ranged from 24 to 65 years (mean 41.3 years), were treated for posterior vertebral rim separation by various methods. All patients had discectomy and removal of bony fragment. Wide fenestration or hemilaminectomy was performed for 24 type I-III lesions, laminectomy for four type II and one type III lesion, and bilateral fenestration for 5 of 17 type II lesions. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) was performed in 11 patients using autogenous iliac bone or poly (ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) spacer implant.
Results: 
Follow-up studies were performed for all patients ranging from 11 months to 4.6 years with an average period of 2.7 years. There were no serious intra-operative or postoperative complications. Satisfactory results were achieved in all patients except two with type III lesions, mostly because of a long history of hypaesthesia of the leg and a drop foot. Eleven patients who had PLIF exhibited bony fusion at final follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Early operative treatment should be performed on patients after a brief trial of conservative treatment. A proper surgical operation must be based on the type and location of the separated bony fragment and clinical symptoms.},

Extracanal leakage of both low-viscosity PMMA and calcium phosphate (CP) as well as the following roentgenographic parameters: segmental kyphosis (SKA), anterior (AVBHr) and posterior (PVBHr) vertebral body height ratio, spinal canal encroachment (SCE) clearance, and functional outcome measures: VAS and SF-36, were recorded and compared between the two groups. All patients in both groups were followed for a minimum 26 (Group A) and 25 (Group B) months. Extracanal CP and PMMA leakage was observed in four (18 %) and three (15 %) vertebrae/patients of group A and B, respectively. Hybrid fixation improved AVBHr, SKA, SCE, but PVBHr only in group B. VAS and SF-36 improved postoperatively in the patients of both groups. Short-segment construct with the novel KIVA implant restored better than BK-fractured lumbar vertebral body, but this had no impact in functional outcome. Since there was no leakage difference between PMMA and calcium phosphate and no short-term adverse related to PMMA use were observed, we advice the use of PMMA in fresh traumatic lumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
Flexion-distraction injuries occur due to distractive forces causing disruption of the posterior and middle spinal columns. These fractures classically consist of a fracture line through the posterior bony elements; involvement of the posterior ligamentous complex is, however, common. Surgical treatment is often required for these unstable injuries to avoid neurological deterioration and posttraumatic kyphosis, and the surgery traditionally consists of an open posterior approach with instrumented fusion. Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for these injuries, with the goal of minimal tissue disruption and preservation of normal anatomy while achieving adequate stabilization, has recently been reported in the literature, but to date, a direct comparative study comparing open and percutaneous fixation has not been reported. The authors report their experience treating these fractures with both techniques and review the available literature.
Methods: 
Patients with flexion-distraction injury who were treated between May 2003 and March 2013 were prospectively followed. American Spinal Injury Association scores and degree of kyphotic angulation were recorded at admission, discharge, and follow-up. Data regarding intraoperative blood loss and operative time were obtained from a chart review. Patients treated with open versus minimally invasive procedures were compared.
Results: 
The authors identified 39 patients who suffered flexion-distraction injuries and were treated at their institution during the specified period; one of these patients declined surgery. All had injury to the posterior ligamentous complex. Open surgical procedures with pedicle screw fixation and posterolateral fusion were performed in 27 patients, while 11 patients underwent minimally invasive pedicle screw placement. Overall, there was improvement in kyphotic angulation at the time of discharge as well as most recent follow-up in both the open surgery and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) groups. The authors found no significant difference in American Spinal Injury Association score or the degree of kyphotic angulation between the MIS and open surgery groups. There was a trend toward shorter operative time for the MIS group, and patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures had significantly less blood loss.
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screw fixation appears to have similar efficacy in the treatment of flexion-distraction injuries and it allows for reduced blood loss and tissue damage compared with open surgical techniques. Therefore it should be considered as an option for the treatment of this type of injury.},

  abstract={Background: 
Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006.
Objectives: 
To compare the outcomes of surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done.
Main results: 
We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.
Authors' conclusions: 
The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. It is likely, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs.},

  abstract={Background: 
Posterior pedicle screw fixation has become a popular method for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, it remains unclear whether additional fusion could improve clinical and radiological outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of fusion as a supplement to pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methodology::Principal findings: 
MEDLINE, OVID, Springer, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the clinical and radiological efficacy of fusion versus nonfusion for thoracolumbar burst fractures managed by posterior pedicle screw fixation. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We generated pooled risk ratios or weighted mean differences across studies. Based on predefined inclusion criteria, 4 eligible trials with a total of 220 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The mean age of the patients was 35.1 years. 96.8% of the fractures were located at T12 to L1 level. Baseline characteristics were similar between the fusion and nonfusion groups. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding radiological outcome, functional outcome, neurologic improvement, and implant failure rate. The pooled data showed that the nonfusion group was associated with significantly reduced operative time (p<0.0001) and blood loss (p  = 0.0003).
Conclusions::Significances: 
The results of this meta-analysis suggested that fusion was not necessary when thoracolumbar burst fracture was treated by posterior pedicle screw fixation. More randomized controlled trials with high quality are still needed in the future.},

  abstract={The use of pedicle screws for short-segment implants has been known to be dangerous in patients who score a 7 or higher on McCormack's classification. The efficiency of ligamentotaxis of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and short-segment implants and fusion in relation to McCormack's classification has not been proven. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of indirect decompression using PLL ligamentotaxis between patients with a high- (score of 7 or higher) or low-grade (score of 6 or less) fracture. Eighteen patients (19 levels) in the low-grade fracture group were compared with 23 patients (27 levels) in the high-grade fracture group. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores; radiologic measures were determined using the spinal canal area and mean sagittal diameter; and the complications were evaluated and compared. A significant improvement in each groups was found in the mean pre- and postoperative spinal canal area, mean sagittal diameter, Cobb's angle, and anterior vertebral height compression rate. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the mean pre- and postoperative spinal canal area, mean sagittal diameter, and anterior vertebral height compression rate. Moreover, the VAS and ODI scores continued to significantly improve at the last follow-up in each group. No difference was found in the prevalence of complications. Despite a high score, no significant difference was found in the clinical and radiological results and the complications. Therefore, indirect decompression using PLL ligamentotaxis was found to be a useful technique for patients who recieve a high McCormack's classification score.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the outcomes of minimally invasive percutaneous short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) with that of trans-spatium intermuscular SSPI on thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fracture without neurological compromise.
Methods: 
A total of 39 patients with thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fracture without neurological deficit receiving treatment between January 2009 and July 2011 were enrolled. Percutaneous SSPI was performed for 18 patients (the percutaneous group), and trans-spatium intermuscular SSPI was performed for 21 patients (the trans-spatium intermuscular group). Peroperative indices, intraoperative radiation exposure time, postoperative and follow-up lumbodorsal pain, function scores, and radiological data were compared.
Results: 
The percutaneous group had significantly less intraoperative blood loss and less severe postoperative pains, but suffered significantly longer fluoroscopy time and higher hospitalization costs compared with the trans-spatium intermuscular group. No significant difference was observed in operating time. All patients were followed up for 17.3 ± 9.2 months (ranging from 5 to 35 months). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of postoperative relative vertebral height (RVH) and regional kyphotic angle (RKA), as well as last follow-up RVH, RKA, lumbodorsal pain, and Oswestry disability index.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous SSPI has the virtues of less intraoperative blood loss and less severe pains in the treatment of thoracolumbar mono-segmental vertebral fracture without neurological deficit. When compared with trans-spatium intermuscular SSPI, it results in longer intraoperative radiation exposure time and a higher surgery cost. To us, percutaneous SSPI has no advantage over trans-spatium intermuscular SSPI in therapeutic outcomes.
Level of evidence: 
Level IV. Retrospective study.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the clinical significance of applicating posterior internal fixation for regulating spinal curvature in thoracolumbar compression fractures.
Methods: 
Between May 2006 and May 2009, 63 patients with thoracolumbar compression fractures were treated, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 33 patients received traditional posterior internal fixation in control group; 30 patients underwent posterior internal fixation with spinal curvature correction under C-arm X-ray device in trial group. There was no significant difference in age, gender, cause of injury, injured segment, grade of fracture, and time from injury to operation between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The Cobb angle, height of injured vertebral body, and disc height were measured by X-ray examination; loosening and breakage of internal fixation were observed and compared between 2 groups. The recovery rate was calculated according to pre- and post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores for each patient.
Results: 
All cases were followed up 20-45 months (mean, 31 months). The postoperative VAS score, ODI, Cobb angle, height of injured vertebral body, and disc height were improved significantly when compared with preoperative values in 2 groups (P < 0.05). At last follow-up, VAS and ODI scores of trial group were significantly better than those of control group (P < 0.05); loss of Cobb angle was (2.1 +/- 1.7) degrees in trial group and (4.2 +/- 3.2) degrees in control group, showing significant difference (t=1.457, P=0.000); loss of disc height was (1.4 +/- 1.2) mm in trial group and (3.4 +/- 2.3) mm in control group, showing significant difference (t=9.336, P= 0.000); loss of height of injured vertebral body was 1.8% +/- 0.6% in trial group and 5.4% +/- 2.1% in control group, showing significant difference (t=3.435, P=0.000). Broken screw and loosening screw occurred in 1 case of control group, respectively (6.1%), but no broken or loosening screw in trial group, showing significant difference (P=0.000).
Conclusion: 
Application of posterior internal fixation for regulating spinal curvature has a good clinical effectiveness. The postoperative spinal curvature, the height of injured vertebral body, and disc height can be improved significantly and low back pain can be recovered satisfactorily. The modified technique is also effective in reducing broken and loosening incidence of the fixation system.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The purpose of this study is to determine the long term-results after thoracoscopic spondylodesis particularly with respect to a ventral versus dorso-ventral treatment strategy.
Methods: 
In this prospective cohort study, a follow-up examination was performed in 19 patients (seven men, 12 women, average age: 37.7 years, follow-up rate: 79 %), six years after ventral thoracoscopic spondylodesis of unstable, incomplete burst fractures. Nine patients received a ventral monosegmental spondylodesis with iliac crest bone graft. The other ten cases were treated dorso-ventrally, five undergoing a ventral monosegmental treatment with iliac crest bone graft; the other five a ventral bisegmental treatment with expandable titanium cage.
Results: 
The complication rate was 15.7 %, the rate of revision of 10.5 %. No complication was related to the ventral thoracoscopic approach, whereas all of them were related to the iliac crest bone graft. The operative bisegmental kyphotic reduction was higher in the dorso-ventrally treated group. Afterwards, the loss of reduction was similar in both study groups. The mean VAS spine score summed up to more than 80 in both groups. The mean PCS scores were comparable to a normal healthy collective of the same age.
Conclusions: 
The ventral thoracoscopic approach to the spine seems to be a safe therapeutic strategy. A dorso-ventral treatment concept goes along with a higher operative reduction potential.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit.
Materials and methods: 
Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5 years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP),blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS).
Results: 
At a mean 25.5 months' follow-up,there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon. This higher exposure dose, however, is to be relativized by comparison to that of the postoperative CT scan, which involved a much higher exposure dose for the patient.

  abstract={Study design: 
We retrospectively compared 25 cases that used the autogenous iliac bone grafting with 18 cases that used a titanium mesh cage for reconstruction of the vertebral body.
Objective: 
To analyze clinical and radiographic results of the autogenous iliac bone and a titanium mesh cage used to reconstruct the vertebral body.
Summary of background data: 
Grafting of the autogenous iliac bone as a strut bone has been traditionally applied for reconstruction of the spine using anterior approach. Although grafting the autogenous iliac bone as a strut bone achieves a high bone fusion rate, it has reported complications in the donor site. For this reason, bone fusion with a mesh cage has been introduced.
Methods: 
Between March 2000 and December 2010, 43 cases that underwent decompression and instrumented fusion for unstable burst fractures using the anterior approach were enrolled. Levels of injury were T12 in 8 cases, L1 in 19 cases, L2 in 11 cases, and L3 in 5 cases. The mean follow-up period was 64.5 months (range, 14-129 mo).
Results: 
The local kyphotic angle in the group that used the tricortical autogenous iliac bone (group A) was measured 24.81±2.27 degrees preoperatively and 4.95±0.61 degrees at the last follow-up. The angle in the group that used a titanium mesh cage (group B) was 25.21±1.55 degrees preoperatively and 3.9±0.43 degrees at the last follow-up. Both groups obtained bone fusion of grade I and II by Bridwell fusion criteria. The operation site visual analog scale and Korean Oswestry disability index did not differ significantly between 2 groups. Donor site visual analog scale and the operation time was significantly in favor of group B (P<0.05).
Conclusions: 
Titanium mesh cage filled with the autogenous cancellous bone shortened operation time and reduced the risk of complications in the donor site compared with the group that used the tricortical iliac bone.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Controversies persist for the best treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Anterior corpectomy and discectomy followed by reconstruction with intervertebral cage and posterior fixation, for example, are based mainly on the widespread assumption that intervertebral discs involved in burst-type fractures, typically, do not survive the traumatic event and will degenerate irrevocably.
Purpose: 
To evaluate whether intervertebral discs, located adjacent to traumatic burst fractures and treated with pedicle screw fixation and direct end-plate restoration, survive the traumatic event or irrevocably progress to severe disc degeneration.
Study design: 
Prospective trial.
Patient sample: 
Twenty adult patients with traumatic burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine and treated with pedicle screw fixation and direct end-plate reduction were included.
Outcome measures: 
Disc degeneration according to the Pfirrmann classification.
Methods: 
Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained preoperatively, 1 month after surgery and 1 month after pedicle screw removal 12 to 18 months after index surgery. Degeneration of the intervertebral discs adjacent to the fracture was assessed using the Pfirrmann classification. Grade 1/2/3 was defined as mild-to-moderate degeneration of the intervertebral disc (MDID), whereas Grade 4/5 was defined as severe-to-endstage degeneration of the intervertebral disc (SDID). Repeated measure analysis was performed to detect significant differences between MDID and SDID scores.
Results: 
A total of 19 patients (38 discs) were fully documented and available for study. All discs showed MDID preoperatively, and while five discs (13%) progressed to SDID at 12 to 18 months posttrauma, the other discs did not show progression of degeneration.
Conclusions: 
Intervertebral discs adjacent to traumatic burst fractures treated with pedicle screw instrumentation and direct end-plate restoration do not routinely seem to progress to severe degeneration at 12 to 18 months postinjury.},

  abstract={Background: 
To offer a correct treatment strategy for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures remains a huge challenge in modern spine surgery.
Patients and methods: 
In the years 2002 and 2003 5 patients with incomplete burst fractures (AO type A3.1) of the thoracolumbar spine were included in this study (4 men, 1 woman, average age: 62.6 years, follow-up rate: 100 %). All 5 were treated by kyphoplasty and additional dorsal bisegmental instrumentation. Unlike today, dorsal instrumentation was done without cement augmentation. Inclusion criteria were age above 60 years, an adequate trauma, and a fracture between thoracic body 11 and lumbar body 3. Data acquisition was performed prospectively before and after the operation, after 3, 6, 12, 18 months, and after 5 years, including visual analogue scale (VAS) spine score, spinal function score, X-ray examination or in cases of complaints or limited assessability a CT examination, and SF 36 score after 5 years. As comparison group, we used 4 patients, suffering the same fracture type with a similar fracture location (1 man, 3 women, average age: 67.3 years), who were treated with kyphoplasty alone during the same time period.
Results: 
No clinically relevant intra- and postoperative complications were registered in our study group. The operative bisegmental kyphotic reduction was slightly higher in our study group. Afterwards the correction loss was 9.8° in our study group, exceeding the reduction by 3.6°, whereas the comparison group suffered from a correction loss of 11.8°, exceeding the operative reduction by 8.5°, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were registered with respect of physical component summary (PSC), mental component summary (MSC) score and VAS spine score. Both groups had comparable PSC and MSC scores to a norm group of the same age.
Conclusion: 
After 5 years the therapy concept seems to be of low risk and not being associated with major complications. The PCS and MCS scores are comparable to a norm group of the same age. The correction loss exceeded the operative reduction marginally but turned out to be slightly lower compared to that of an isolated kyphoplasty.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The optimal timing of stabilization in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. There is currently a lack of consensus on the timing of surgical stabilization, which is limited by the reality that a randomized controlled trial to evaluate early versus late stabilization is difficult to perform. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the benefits, safety and costs of early stabilization compared with late stabilization using data available in the current literature.
Methods: 
An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies evaluating the timing of surgery in patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Two reviewers independently analyzed and selected each study on the basis of the eligibility criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (GRADE). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
Ten studies involving 2,512 subjects were identified. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization shortened the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days and reduced morbidity and hospital expenses for patients with thoracic fractures. However, reduced morbidity and hospital expenses were not observed with stabilization of lumbar fractures. Owing to the very low level of evidence, no conclusion could be made regarding the effect of early stabilization on mortality.
Conclusions: 
We could adhere to the recommendation that patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures should undergo early stabilization, which may reduce the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, morbidity and hospital expenses, particularly when the thoracic spine is involved. Individual patient characteristics should be concerned carefully. However, the definite conclusion cannot be made due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and low level of evidence. Further prospective studies are required to confirm whether there are benefits to early stabilization compared with late stabilization.},

  abstract={Background: 
The debate over the use of intracorporeal bone graft in treating unstable thoracolumbar fractures continues. We compiled evidence for the effect of transpedicular intracorporeal bone grafting (TPG) on outcome in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures.
Method: 
A systematic review was conducted to compare the outcomes of short segment fixation and posterolateral fusion (PLF) with or without TPG. We reviewed articles in PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Database published between January 1995 and August 2011. The correction loss and hardware failure between TPG and TPG+PLF were compared. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies according to the inclusion criteria.
Result: 
We divided 19 papers, involving 22 series, into two groups: posterolateral fusion, and posterolateral fusion combined with intracorporeal bone graft. Meta-analysis regression revealed statistically significant differences in correction loss and hardware failure between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in average age, follow-up period, fracture levels, or application of orthosis rate between the two groups.
Conclusion: 
PLF+TPG reduces hardware failure and correction loss compared with PLF alone. It also minimizes the likelihood of severe correction loss. For serious spinal injury cases, PLF+TPG was recommended to improve the prognosis. Further studies would be useful in determining the benefits of applying this method to the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the surgical therapeutic result of thoracolumbar fracture treated by two minimally invasive surgery or by traditional open operation.
Methods: 
From June 2004 to April 2010, 76 patients (45 males and 31 females, with an average age of 36.4 years, ranging from 21 to 58 years) with thoracolumbar fracture were divided into three groups. In group A, 24 patients were treated with minimally invasive internal fixation by endoscope. In group B, 20 patients were treated by Sextant percutaneous pedicle screws fiaxation. In group C, 32 patients were performed with traditional open fixation surgery. The perioperative index and radiographic factor were compared among the three groups.
Results: 
All patients were followed-up for 1 year in average. The internal fixation devices were taken out averaged 1 year after operation,there were no complications related to the internal fixaton systems. The perioperative index of groups A and B including the incision size, surgical blood loss, surgical draining loss, hospital stay time and post-operation VAS score were significant smaller than group C (P < 0.05). The Cobb's angle, sagittal index, and anterior height of the fracture vertebral body were all significantly different between pre-operation and post-operation in each group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
These two methods of minimally invasive surgical treatments are effective and safe for patients with thoracolumbar fracture,because of less damage to muscles, less blood loss and quicker recovery, compared to the traditional open operation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the long-term influence of vertebral fixation through or across the affected vertebra on vertebral morphology.
Methods: 
Clinical data of 48 patients with simple thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures who were admitted between Jan. 2008 and Dec. 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Among them 36 cases (28 males and 8 females) were fixed through the injured vertebra (group A) and 12 cases (8 males and 4 females) were fixed across the injured vertebra (group B). All patients were followed up for 6-36 months (mean 11.5 months). The vertebral body height, endplate angle and neurofunction were compared between the two groups before surgery, a week after surgery and at the end of the follow-up period.
Results: 
There was no statistically significant difference in vertebral body height,endplate angle and neurofunction before operation between group A and B (P > 0.05). Vertebral body height and endplate angle improved in both groups a week after operation and at the end of the follow-up period as compared with those before operation (P < 0.05), and the efficacy in group B was significantly better than that in group A (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in neurofunction between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The fixation method through the injured vertebra had a better reduction effect, more stable fixation, and a better long-term effect on vertebral morphology than that across the injured vertebra in the treatment of thoracolumbar vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the safety and efficacies of traditional open versus percutaneous monosegmental pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of incomplete thoracolumbar spinal fracture.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was conducted for 44 inpatients with a diagnosis of incomplete thoracolumbar spinal fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) undergoing monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI) from September 2008 to January 2011. There were 24 cases in percutaneous group and 20 cases in traditional open group. The mean operative duration, blood loss, blood drainage, visual analogue scale/score (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle at pre- and post-operation were evaluated.
Results: 
No significant differences existed in operative durations between two groups (P > 0.05). Significant differences between two groups were observed in terms of intra-operative blood loss and VAS scores at Week 1 postoperation (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in VAS score preoperation, 1 year postoperation or pre-and post-operative vertebral kyphotic angle (P > 0.05). No complications of iatrogenic neurological injury or hardware failure occurred.
Conclusion: 
The application of percutaneous monosegment pedicle instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures in type of A 3.1 and A 3.2 is both feasible and safe. Its postoperative therapeutic effect is comparable to that of traditional open monosegmental fixation.},

  abstract={Surgical treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures is controversial. Most authors reported that short segment fixation led to a high incidence of implant failure and correction loss. On the other hand, long segment fixation has the disadvantage of fusing more segments. We aimed to compare the outcomes of long-segment fixation versus two or three levels above and one level below fixation for acute thoracolumbar fractures. Twenty six consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 14 patients treated with long fixation, whereas group 2 included 12 patients treated with two or three levels above and one level below fixation. Fractures were classified according to the Mc Cormack, Magerl and Denis classifications. Clinical (Oswestry questionnaire, Visual analog score) and radiological (Sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, local kyphosis and Cobb angle) outcomes were analysed. The average follow-up for the long and hybrid fixation groups were 28 and 20 months respectively. Clinical scores of both groups at the last follow-up were not significantly different. The preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, anterior body height compression, local kyphosis angle and Cobb angle were not significantly different. Correction loss of 3.36 degrees was seen in the long segment fixation group, versus 2.75 degrees in the other group at the last follow-up. There was no significant difference between the results achieved in the patients who had transpedicular fixation two or three levels above and one level below the fractured vertebra and those who had long segment fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
The load-sharing score (LSS) of vertebral body comminution is predictive of results after short-segment posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Some authors have posited that an LSS > 6 is predictive of neurological injury, ligamentous injury, and the need for surgical intervention. However, the authors of the present study hypothesized that the LSS does not predict ligamentous or neurological injury.
Methods: 
The prospectively collected spinal cord injury database from a single institution was queried for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Study inclusion criteria were acute (< 24 hours) burst fractures between T-10 and L-2 with preoperative CT and MRI. Flexion-distraction injuries and pathological fractures were excluded. Four experienced spine surgeons determined the LSS and posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) integrity. Neurological status was assessed from a review of the medical records.
Results: 
Forty-four patients were included in the study. There were 4 patients for whom all observers assigned an LSS > 6, recommending operative treatment. Eleven patients had LSSs ≤ 6 across all observers, suggesting that nonoperative treatment would be appropriate. There was moderate interobserver agreement (0.43) for the overall LSS and fair agreement (0.24) for an LSS > 6. Correlations between the LSS and the PLC score averaged 0.18 across all observers (range -0.02 to 0.34, p value range 0.02-0.89). Correlations between the LSS and the American Spinal Injury Association motor score averaged -0.12 across all observers (range -0.25 to -0.03, p value range 0.1-0.87). Correlations describing the relationship between an LSS > 6 and the treating physician's decision to operate averaged 0.17 across all observers (range 0.11-0.24, p value range 0.12-0.47).
Conclusions: 
The LSS does not uniformly correlate with the PLC injury, neurological status, or empirical clinical decision making. The LSSs of only one observer correlated significantly with PLC injury. There were no significant correlations between the LSS as determined by any observer and neurological status or clinical decision making.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the safety and therapeutic effects of mono-segmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI) in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2).
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 cases with thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) between April 2005 and February 2010. Half of the 60 inpatients were treated with MSPI, and the other half was treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). The mean operation time, blood loss, visual analog scale (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle before and after surgery were compared.
Results: 
In the MSPI group, the mean operation time was 90 ± 25 min, and the blood loss at operation was 180 ± 62 ml. The vertebral kyphotic angles were 17.3° ± 9.3° before surgery, 6.5° ± 6.5° one week after surgery, and 9.5° ± 6.4° for the latest follow-up. The VAS scores were 7.5 ± 1.4 before surgery, 2.5 ± 0.7 one week after surgery, and 1.4 ± 0.8 for the latest follow-up. In the SSPI group, the mean operation time was 101 ± 28 min, and the blood loss at operation was 203 ± 88 ml. The follow-up duration was 12-64 months. The vertebral kyphotic angles were 16.5° ± 9.1° before surgery, 7.1° ± 6.9° one week after surgery, and 7.5° ± 5.2° for the latest follow-up. The VAS scores were 6.7 ± 1.5 before surgery, 3.0 ± 0.4 one week after surgery, and 1.1 ± 0.6 for the latest follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in the operation time, blood loss at operation, VAS score and vertebral kyphotic angle before and after surgery (p > 0.05). The post-surgical VAS scores and vertebral kyphotic angles were significantly decreased in both groups, compared to before surgery (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
It is safe and effective to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures (AO 3.1 and AO 3.2) with MSPI. The mean operation time, blood loss at operation, post-surgical VAS and vertebral kyphotic angle of the MSPI group are similar, compared to the SSPI group. Further research is needed to find out whether therapeutic effects of MSPI are better than those of conservative treatment in these cases.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To study the therapeutic method and effect of minimally invasive surgery for the thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of the minimally invasive surgically treatment thoracolumbar fractures from February 2005 to June 2010 was performed. There were 183 cases, 126 males and 57 females, aged 18 to 68 years, average 38.9 years. The involved levels of fractures were T(11) in 22, T(12) in 61, L(1) in 71, L(2) in 29. According to Gertzbein classification, 145 cases were type A fractures, 34 cases were type B fractures, 4 cases were type C fractures; According to Load-sharing score, 51 cases were 4 scores, 56 cases were 5 scores, 17 cases were 6 scores, 12 cases were 7 scores, 24 cases were 8 scores, 23 cases were 9 scores. Different surgical methods were selected according to the minimally invasive surgical strategy, 22 patients were treated with the minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screws osteosynthesis (MIPPSO group), 102 patients were treated with the small-incision pedicle screws osteosynthesis (SISPSO group), 31 patients were treated with the small incision anterior thoracolumbar surgery (SIATS group) assisted by thoracoscope or headlight, and 28 patients were treated with the 270° decompression and reconstruction surgery (270° DRS group) via a posterior small incision. Preoperative and postoperative neurological status, the correction and loss of Cobb's angle, the decompression scope of spinal canal, the location and union of bone graft were followed up and reviewed.
Results: 
All of 183 cases had successful surgery and were followed up. In the MIPPSO group, operative time was 52 - 100 min, blood loss was 35 - 55 ml. In the the SISPSO group, operative time was 48-68 min, the blood loss was 45 - 65 ml the correction of Cobb's angle in the two groups was 8° - 19°. In the SIATS group, operative time was 140 - 220 min, the blood loss was 160 - 1500 ml the correction of Cobb's angle was 15° - 25°, 1 case had pleural effusion, 1 had lateral femoral cutaneous nerve damage, the complications disappeared after treatment. In the 270° DRS group the operative time was 160-280 min, the blood loss was 700 - 4700 ml, the correction of Cobb's angle was 15° - 28°. The spinal canal mass was removed, the spinal canal was enlarged and completely decompressed. Neurological status improved in all of the preoperative incomplete paraplegia patients except 1 case whose neurological symptoms aggravated.
Conclusion: 
It is satisfactory that the minimally invasive surgical strategy was rational used in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To assess the effectiveness of different bone graft fusion ways in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Between June 2000 and June 2009, 126 cases of thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated by one-stage posterior short segment internal fixation combined with bone graft fusion. All patients had acute spine and spinal injury at the levels of T11-L2, who were with different degrees of neural function injury (below Frankel grade D). The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups and were treated respectively by centrum combined with interbody bone graft fusion (group A), posterolateral bone graft fusion (group B), and ring bone graft fusion (group C) combined with posterior short segment pedicle instrumentation. The changes of the Cobb angle, correction loss of Cobb angle, bone fusion rate, internal fixation failure rate, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Frankel grade of the fracture vertebral were observed after operation to evaluate the effectiveness of different bone graft fusion ways.
Results: 
All 126 cases were followed up 24-32 months (mean, 28 months). The operation time and bleeding volume in group C were significantly larger than those in groups A and B (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and B (P > 0.05). At 2 years after operation and last follow-up, the Cobb angle and correction loss in group B were significantly larger than those in groups A and C (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between groups A and C (P > 0.05). At last follow-up, the bone fusion rate and internal fixation failure rate were 100% and 0 in group A, 78.6% and 21.4% in group B, and 97.5% and 0 in group C; there were significant differences between group B and groups A, C (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and C (P > 0.05). ODI and Frankel grade were obviously improved after operation, showing significant differences between preoperation and last follow-up (P < 0.05) in 3 groups, between group B and groups A, C (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and C (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The centrum combined with interbody bone graft fusion is best in 3 bone graft fusion ways because of its optimum bone fusion and according with human body biomechanics mechanism. Back out board bone graft fusion may not a appropriate bone fusion way because of its high internal fixation failure rate and not according with human body biomechanics mechanism. The ring bone graft fusion may not be an indispensable bone fusion way because of its common bone fusion ratio and lower cost-performance ratio.},

  abstract={Background: 
The optimal treatment strategy for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction is discussed controversially in the literature. Whilst 360° fusion has shown to result in better radiological outcome, recent studies have failed to show its superiority concerning clinical outcome. The morbidity associated with the additional anterior approach may account for these findings. The aim of this prospective observational study was therefore to compare two different techniques for 360° fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures using either thoracoscopy or a transforaminal approach (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF)) to support the anterior column.
Methods: 
Posterior reduction and short-segmental fixation using angular stable pedicle screw systems were performed in all patients as a first step. Monocortical strut grafts were used for the anterior support in the TLIF group, whilst tricortical grafts or titanium vertebral body replacing implants of adjustable height were used in the combined posteroanterior group. At final follow-up, the radiological outcome was assessed by performing X-rays in a standing position. The clinical outcome was measured using five validated outcome scores. The morbidity associated with the approaches and the donor site was assessed as well.
Results: 
There were 21 patients in the TLIF group and 14 patients in the posteroanterior group included. The postoperative loss of correction was higher in the TLIF group (4.9°±8.3° versus 3.4°±6.4°, p>0.05). There were no significant differences regarding the outcome scores between the two groups. There were no differences in terms of return to employment, leisure activities and back function either. More patients suffered from donor-site morbidity in the TLIF group, whilst the morbidity associated with the surgical approach was higher in the posteroanterior group.
Conclusion: 
The smaller donor-site morbidity in the posteroanterior group is counterbalanced by an additional morbidity associated with the anterior approach resulting in similar clinical outcome. Mastering both techniques will allow the spine surgeon to be more flexible in specific situations, for example, in patients with neurological deficits or severe concomitant thoracic trauma.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the clinical therapeutic outcomes for severe burst fracture of lumbar vertebrae via a posterior approach for one-stage spinal "three-column" reconstruction.
Methods: 
An retrospective analysis of data was performed for 21 patients with severe burst fracture of lumbar vertebrae undergoing a posterior approach for one-stage spinal "three-column" reconstruction from 2005 to 2010. It was compared with previous 15 cases undergoing a staged anteroposterior approach. The operative duration, volume of blood loss, pre- and post-operative imaging measurements of kyphosis and vertebral height and nerve function recovery were evaluated.
Results: 
The values of operative duration and volume of blood loss in the one-stage posterior approach group were significantly less than those of the two-stage anteroposterior approach group [(263 ± 72) min vs (439 ± 75) min, t = -5.303, P < 0.01; (1143 ± 296) ml vs (1471 ± 399) ml, t = -2.169, P = 0.042)]. Statistical significance existed in postoperative kyphosis between two groups [(0.5 ± 2.0)° vs (3.9 ± 2.6)°, t = -3.336, P = 0.003]. Vertebral height had no statistical significance pre- and post-operatively between two groups while restoration of vertebral height did [(0.47 ± 0.19) mm vs (0.26 ± 0.15) mm, t = 2.669, P = 0.015].
Conclusion: 
Posterior approach for one-stage vertebral resection, mesh implantation, pedicle screws and rod internal fixation for reconstructing spinal "three-column" structures offers excellent feasibility and safety. And it may avoid complications associated with an anteroposterior approach for two-stage procedures. The median length of hospital stay is also reduced.},

  abstract={A retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare fusion rates achieved by H-grafts, posterior vertebral grafts, and no graft for the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. Ninety-two patients were included in this study. The patients fell into 1 of 3 groups: those who received H-grafts (n=36), posterior vertebral grafts (n=30), and no graft (n=26). Mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 24-51 months). All operations were performed by a single senior surgeon. All patients underwent operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation. Radiographic parameters, estimated blood loss, operative time, and length of hospital stay were compared among patients in the 3 graft groups. Differences were assessed using unpaired t tests. P values <.05 were considered significant. We found no significant difference among groups in age, fracture location, or type of fracture. Patients who received H-grafts or posterior vertebral grafts achieved solid fusion, but spontaneous fusion occurred in only 2 patients who received no bone graft. Most patients with neurological deficits showed significant neurological improvement. Operative time and estimated blood loss were significantly lower in the no-graft group than in the H-graft and posterior vertebral graft groups (P<.05). Mean loss of correction, operative time, and estimated blood loss were lower for patients who received H-grafts than for those who received posterior vertebral grafts (P<.05). The use of an atlas fixation system in combination with a posterior H-graft for the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture is a stable and reliable method that effectively prevents inner fixation failure and reduces bone loss and anisotropy.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To observe the effects of expansive pedicle screws fixation combined Wright artificial bone implantation in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture of the elderly.
Methods: 
From March 2007 to July 2009, 12 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with surgery in the study. There were 7 males and 5 females, with an average age of 62.3 years (from 56 to 71 years). Nerve functions of all patients were ASIA classified grade E. According to TLICS score system, 6 points were in 5 cases and 7 points were in 7 cases. Expansive pedicle screw system was used and Wright artificial bone was injected into the injuried vertebrae. The anterior border height of vertebral body and Cobb angle were observed at the preoperation, postoperation and final follow-up.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 10 to 15 months with an average of 12 months. Wounds healed well, pain in the chest-back abated, no the expansive pedicle screws loosened or broke down. The anterior border height of vertebral body increased from (32.3 +/- 9.1)% preoperatively to (95.3 +/- 3.2)% postoperatively; and the Cobb angle decreased from (31.6 +/- 6.8) degrees preoperatively to (4.5 +/- 3.2) degrees postoperatively. There was significant difference between two groups (P<0.01). After 3 months, the anterior border height of vertebral body was (94.7 +/- 3.3)% and the Cobb angle was (4.6 +/- 3.4) degrees; at the final follow-up, the anterior border height of vertebral body was (93.2 +/- 3.6)% and the Cobb angle was (5.3 +/- 3.7) degrees. There was no significant difference between the two data (P>0.05).
Conclusion: 
The combination of expansive pedicle screws fixation and Wright artificial bone injection is a good treatment for thoracolumbar burst fracture, with advantages such as easy operation and good effect, which mainly applied to patients with no obvious nerve injuries.},

  abstract={Posterior short-segmental fixation is reliable for the management of thoracolumbar fractures; however, it is associated with recurrence of kyphosis and failure of fixation. This study compared the short-term results of short-segmental fixation combined with intermediate screws with those of conventional intersegmental fixation in the treatment of monosegmental thoracolumbar fractures. The records of 62 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar monosegmental fractures who underwent conventional 4-screw intersegmental fixation (35 patients) or short-segmental fixation combined with intermediate screws (27 patients) were reviewed. The study population included 43 men and 19 women (mean age, 44.1±13.6 years). The majority of fractures were L1 (28 [45.1%]) and T12 (21 [33.9%]) fractures. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to the preoperative relative height of the fractured vertebra or the segmental kyphotic angle. There was a significant difference in the restoration rate between the conventional and short-segmental fixation groups (62.6±38.7% vs 100.4±25.4%, respectively; P<.001). However, a statistically significant decrease in postoperative segmental kyphotic angle was noted in both groups (P<.001). The mean change of segmental kyphotic angle in the short-segmental fixation group was greater than in the conventional fixation group (14.4±6.8° vs 8.3±7.9°, respectively; P<.002). Patients in the short-segmental fixation group ambulated an average of 10 days earlier than those in the conventional fixation group. These findings indicate that compared to conventional intersegmental fixation, short-segmental fixation combined with intermediate screws more effectively restores fractured vertebral height, is associated with a decrease in the segmental kyphotic angle, and allows earlier ambulation.},

To investigate the safety and therapeutic effects of monosegment pedicle instrumentation in treating incomplete thoracolumbar burst fracture.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 56 inpatients with incomplete thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) from April 2005 to January 2010. There were 28 cases were fixed with monosegment pedicle instrumentation (MSPI), 28 cases were fixed with short segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). The operative time, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle (VK) before and after surgery were evaluated.
Results: 
In the group of MSPI, the mean operative time was (93 ± 20) min; the intraoperative blood loss was (184 ± 64) ml; the VK angle was 17° ± 10° before operation, 7° ± 7° at one week after operation, and 10° ± 7° at latest follow-up; VAS score was 7.6 ± 1.5 before operation, 2.4 ± 0.8 at one week after operation, and 1.5 ± 0.9 at latest follow-up; no adjacent segment degeneration was found. In the group of SSPI, the operative time was (102 ± 30) min; the intraoperative blood loss was (203 ± 88) ml; the VK angle was 17° ± 9° before operation, 7° ± 7° at one week after operation, and 8° ± 5° at latest follow-up; VAS score was 6.8 ± 1.3 before operation, 3.1 ± 0.5 at one week after operation, and 1.2 ± 0.7 at latest follow-up. One case of adjacent segment degeneration was found in 36 months after operation. There were no significantly statistical differences between two groups in operative time, blood loss, VAS score and VK angle before and after surgery (P > 0.05). The VAS score and VK angle at one week after surgery and latest follow-up all decreased obviously than preoperative ones in both groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
MSPI for incomplete thoracolumbar burst fracture is effective and safe. The operative blood loss, the mean operative time, the improvement of VAS score and the VK angle in group MSPI are equal to those in group SSPI.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The currently accepted treatment of thoracolumbar fractures is reduction, decompression, fixation and arthrodesis. However, it is not the perfect solution due to the medium- and long-term consequences of arthrodesis, which include the wear of the adjacent segments above and below. Some previous studies have proposed the treatment with fixation without arthrodesis. However, there are no reports on the medium- and long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up.
Material and methods: 
Two 20-patient groups treated with transpedicular fixation and decompression, one with and one without posterolateral arthrodesis, were compared.
Results: 

Control group: 
The mean hospital stay was 5 days. The postoperative visual analog scale pain score was 2-3 in 4 patients; the rest were asymptomatic. The functional Oswestry disability index was 8.3%. The functional economic rehabilitation scale was 4.55. Case group: The mean hospital stay was 5 days. The postoperative visual analog scale pain score was 1-2 in 2 patients; the rest were asymptomatic. The functional Oswestry disability index was 6.3%. The functional economic rehabilitation scale was 6.4.
Conclusions: 
Both groups had very similar results. The group without arthrodesis had better results in the Oswestry functional disability scale and the functional economic rehabilitation scale.},

  abstract={Many studies have proven that the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation of the pedicle screw can significantly increase stiffness and strength of spinal fixation. Some major complications have also been reported. However, there are no reports discussing cement distribution and its morphology in the osteoporotic vertebral body, which is critical in the analysis of the biomechanical strength of the pedicle screw and the risk of cement leakage after pedicle screw augmentation. In this study, we used computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the cement distribution in the osteoporotic vertebral body after PMMA augmentation of a pedicle screw and to analyze the factors leading to cement leakage. Two groups of patients were studied. Group A consisted 25 osteoporotic patients (mean age of 73 years) with spinal instrumentation who had a total of 145 pedicle screws and cement augmentation with biopsy needles. Group B consisted of 23 osteoporotic patients (mean age of 74.6 years) with spinal instrumentation who had a total of 125 cannulated pedicle screws with cement augmentation. All patients had CT evaluation of the cement distribution in the vertebral body after the surgery. The cement distribution in the vertebrae was divided into four zones in the axial CT view: anterior one-third, middle third, and posterior third of vertebral body, and the pedicle. The morphology of the cement distribution around the pedicle screw was defined as scattered type or concentrate type. The leakage pattern was divided to anterior-lateral, posterior-lateral, and canal leakage. The correlations among bone mineral density (BMD), the cement leakage rate, and cement distribution morphology were also analyzed. The results showed that most augmented pedicle screws had cement extension into three of the four zones of the vertebral body (66.3%), followed by two zones (20%), all four zones (11.5%), and only one zone (2.2%). Overall, 123 screws (84.8%) in Group A and 108 screws (86.4%) in Group B had cement concentrate type distribution. The cement leakage rate in Group A is 18.3% and 13.6% in Group B. Patients with a BMD <0.6 g/cm(2) had significantly higher rates of cement leakage and tended toward a scattered cement distribution. There was only one patient who had a symptomatic leakage (sciatica) in Group B. We concluded that the cement distribution after pedicle screw augmentation with biopsy needle or cannulated screw technique was mostly localized in three zones of the vertebral body, and patients with lower BMD had a higher risk of cement leakage and scattered cement distribution.},

The purpose of this multicenter trial was to investigate the outcome and durability of a single-stage thoracolumbar corpectomy using expandable cages via a posterior approach.
Methods: 
The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of 67 consecutive patients who underwent single-stage thoracolumbar corpectomies with circumferential reconstruction for pathological, traumatic, and osteomyelitic pathologies. Circumferential reconstruction was accomplished using expandable cages along with posterior instrumentation and fusion. Correction of the sagittal deformity, the American Spinal Injury Association score, and complications were recorded.
Results: 
Single-stage thoracolumbar corpectomies resulted in an average sagittal deformity correction of 6.2° at a mean follow-period of 20.5 months. At the last follow-up, a fusion rate of 68% was observed for traumatic and osteomyelitic fractures. Approximately one-half of the patients remained neurologically stable. Improvement in neurological function occurred in 23 patients (38%), whereas 7 patients (11%) suffered from a decrease in lower-extremity motor function. The deterioration in neurological function was due to progression of metastatic disease in 5 patients. Five constructs (7%) failed-3 of which had been placed for traumatic fractures, 1 for a pathological fracture, and 1 for an osteomyelitic fracture. Other complications included epidural hematomas in 3 patients and pleural effusions in 2.
Conclusions: 
Single-stage posterior corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction were performed at multiple centers with a consistent outcome over a wide range of pathologies. Correction of the sagittal deformity was sustained, and the neurological outcome was good in the majority of patients; however, 18% of acute traumatic fractures required revision of the construct.},

  abstract={Aim: 
Minimally invasive surgery is currently a goal for surgical intervention in the spine. The effectiveness of endoscopic thoracic spine surgery and technological improvements are two factors that are always under consideration in the practice of spinal surgery.
Material and methods: 
We present twenty-five patients whose thoracoscopic spinal surgeries were performed between 2002 and 2008 for the treatment of various spinal diseases. Eleven patients with thoracic disc herniation, five patients with traumatic thoracic spinal compressive fracture, six patients with metastatic thoracic spinal tumors and three patients with tubercular spondylitis underwent thoracoscopic spine surgery. Clinical evaluations were performed at 3, 6,12 and 24 months post-surgery. The Oswestry disability questionnaire and linear visual analog scale (VAS) were used for the evaluation of pain.
Results: 
Postoperatively, two patients had lung contusions, one patient had pneumonia and one patient had instability. There were significant initial improvements in both the Oswestry score and the VAS pain score up to 6 months (p<0.05). The average relative difference in pain scores in all groups was not significant at 12 and 24 months (p>0.05).
Conclusion: 
The favorable results of thoracoscopic spinal surgery encourage its application to situations in which a conventional thoracic approach is indicated. Thoracoscopic spine surgery is applicable to all patients with various spinal diseases.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To observe the early clinic outcome of treating thoracolumbar mono-segmental fracture with posterior fixation in combination with intermediate screws.
Methods: 
From July 2006 to August 2008, 35 of 62 patients with thoracolumbar mono-segmental fracture were treated with in Group A and the remaining 27 with intermediate screw in combination with short segmental fixation in Group B.
Results: 
The relative height of fractured vertebrae and reduction rate showed significant differences [(84.2 +/- 2.8) vs (98.6 +/- 1.9), P < 0.05] between two groups while the change of segmental kyphotic angle showed no difference [(8.5 +/- 1.0) vs (8.1 +/- 1.3), P > 0.05].
Conclusion: 
Intermediate screw in combination with short segmental fixation has a better immediate efficiency in treating thoracolumbar mono-segmental fracture since it reduces the height of fractured vertebrae.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective clinical trial was conducted.
Objective: 
To compare the clinical and radiologic late results of monosegmental transpedicular fixation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures and evaluate the efficacy of monosegmental transpedicular fixation.
Summary of background data: 
SSPI (1 level above and 1 below the fracture level) are accepted by many surgeons as an accepted technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. To preserve more motion segments, some authors have advocated monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI). The recent developments showed that MSPI yielded good clinical results; however, there were no report about comparison of clinical outcome between monosegmental and biosegmental transpedicular fixation in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Eighty-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were randomized by a simple method into 2 groups. Group 1 were treated with monosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 47), and group 2 were treated with biosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 38). Clinical (Low Back Outcome Score and Oswestry Disability Index) and radiologic (load-sharing classification index, sagittal index, and percentage of anterior body height compression) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The 2 groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, local kyphosis, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate between the 2 surgical approaches was also not significantly different (group 1 = 6.38% and group 2 = 5.26%). Oswestry Disability Index improved in both groups by >25 points in a similar amount (P = 0.23). The average follow-up Low Back Outcome Score was 74.9 and 60.2 for group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = 0.033).
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, radiologic parameters demonstrated that both MSPI and SSPI are the effective and reliable operative techniques for selected thoracolumbar burst fractures. MSPI shortened the operative time and decreased the amount of blood loss significantly and, thus, offered better clinical results. Nevertheless, long-term studies are supposed to be performed to support the outcomes.},

  abstract={The second, internet-based multicenter study (MCSII) of the Spine Study Group of the German Association of Trauma Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie) is a representative patient collection of acute traumatic thoracolumbar (T1-L5) injuries. The MCSII results are an update of those obtained with the first multicenter study (MCSI) more than a decade ago. The aim of the study was to assess and bring into focus: the (1) epidemiologic data, (2) surgical and radiological outcome, and (3) 2-year follow-up (FU) results of these injuries. According to the Magerl/AO classification, there were 424 (57.8%) compression fractures (A type), 178 (24.3%) distractions injuries (B type), and 131 (17.9%) rotational injuries (C type). B and C type injuries carried a higher risk for neurological deficits, concomitant injuries, and multiple vertebral fractures. The level of injury was located at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) in 67.0% of the case. 380 (51.8%) patients were operated on by posterior stabilization and instrumentation alone (POSTERIOR), 34 (4.6%) had an anterior procedure (ANTERIOR), and 319 (43.5%) patients were treated with combined posteroanterior surgery (COMBINED). 65% of patients with thoracic (T1-T10) and 57% with lumbar spinal (L3-L5) injuries were treated with a single posterior approach (POSTERIOR). 47% of the patients with thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) injuries were either operated from posterior or with a combined posterior-anterior surgery (COMBINED) each. Short angular stable implant systems have replaced conventional non-angular stable instrumentation systems to a large extent. The posttraumatic deformity was restored best with COMBINED surgery. T-spine injuries were accompanied by a higher number and more severe neurologic deficits than TL junction or L-spine injuries. At the same time T-spine injuries showed less potential for neurologic recovery especially in paraplegic (Frankel/AISA A) patients. 5% of all patients required revision surgery for perioperative complications. Follow-up data of 558 (76.1%) patients were available and collected during a 30-month period from 1 January 2004 until 31 May 2006. On average, a posterior implant removal was carried out in a total of 382 COMBINED and POSTERIOR patients 12 months after the initial surgery. On average, the rehabilitation process required 3-4 weeks of inpatient treatment, followed by another 4 months of outpatient therapy and was significantly shorter when compared with MCSI in the mid-1990s. From the time of injury until FU, 80 (60.6%) of 132 patients with initial neurological deficits improved at least one grade on the Frankel/ASIA Scale; 8 (1.3%) patients deteriorated. A higher recovery rate was observed for incomplete neurological injuries (73%) than complete neurological injuries (44%). Different surgical approaches did not have a significant influence on the neurologic recovery until FU. Nevertheless, neurological deficits are the most important factors for the functional outcome and prognosis of TL spinal injuries. POSTERIOR patients had a better functional and subjective outcome at FU than COMBINED patients. However, the posttraumatic radiological deformity was best corrected in COMBINED patients and showed significantly less residual kyphotic deformity (biseg GDW -3.8° COMBINED vs. -6.1° POSTERIOR) at FU (p = 0.005). The sagittal spinal alignment was better maintained when using vertebral body replacement implants (cages) in comparison to iliac strut grafts. Additional anterior plate systems did not have a significant influence on the radiological FU results. In conclusion, comprehensive data of a large patient population with acute thoracolumbar spinal injuries has been obtained and analyzed with this prospective internet-based multicenter study. Thus, updated results and the clinical outcome of the current operative treatment strategies in participating German and Austrian trauma centers have been presented. Nevertheless, it was not possible to answer all remaining questions to contradictory findings of the subjective, clinical outcome and corresponding radiological findings between different surgical subgroups. Randomized-controlled long-term investigations seem mandatory and the next step in future clinical research of Spine Study Group of the German Trauma Society.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Systematic Review.
Objective: 
To determine whether early spinal stabilization in thoracolumbar spine trauma decreases morbidity and mortality.
Summary of background data: 
The role of early spinal stabilization through surgical means may have a number of benefits. These include reduced morbidity and mortality because of more rapid mobilization afforded by spinal column stabilization and a reduction in the incidence and severity of sepsis and respiratory failure. There are several potential disadvantages of early surgery. The most strongly debated is the potential that the additional physiologic injury may result in an unintended increase in morbidity and mortality caused by worsening of existing injuries, such as with pulmonary or intracranial trauma. This problem may be compounded by increased hemorrhage and resulting hypotension. Operating in the presence of missed or underestimated associated injuries or under less-than-ideal conditions relative to the complexity of the surgery and resources required is also a potential disadvantage.
Methods: 
A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published between January 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify published studies examining the timing of thoracolumbar fracture fixation. Two independent reviewers assessed the strength of literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, assessing quality, quantity, and consistency of results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
A total of 68 articles were initially screened, and 9 ultimately met the predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization of thoracic fractures reduced the mean number of days on a ventilator, the number of days in intensive care unit and in hospital, and reduced respiratory morbidity compared with late stabilization. This effect, other than the length of hospital stay, was not seen with stabilization of lumbar fractures. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect of the timing of stabilization on mortality in thoracolumbar fractures.
Conclusion: 
Ideally, patients with unstable thoracic fractures should undergo early (<72 hours) stabilization of their injury to reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective clinical and radiographic study was performed.
Objective: 
To compare 2 grafting materials of anterior augmentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures: transpedicular cancellous bone (TPCB) grafting and transpedicular calcium sulfate grafting and to decide whether calcium sulfate cement can replace autogenous cancellous bone applied in anterior vertebral body augmentation after posterior short-segment instrumentation.
Summary of background data: 
Additional TPCB grafting was developed as an alternative to prevent early implant failure. However, the results are inconsistent and donor-site complications are a major concern. Calcium sulfate has been offered as a bone substitute for treating patients with metaphysis fractures or bone defect, but the results of application in spinal surgeries are uncertain.
Methods: 
Fifty-one patients with a single-level thoracolumbar burst fracture for treatment with short-segment pedicle screw fixation were enrolled in the study. Fractures in group 1 patients were reinforced with TPCB (n = 31), and fractures in group 2 patients were augmented with transpedicular calcium sulfate cement (TPCSC; n = 20). All patients were followed-up at least 2 years after surgery. Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
Results: 
The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, fracture levels, preoperative neurologic status distribution, and the associated injuries. The TPCB group had a longer period of follow-up (52.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 28.6 +/- 3.5 months, P < 0.001). Blood loss and operation time were less in the TPCSC group (247.5 +/- 164.2 vs. 600.0 +/- 403.1 mL, P = 0.001 and 161.7 +/- 28.5 vs. 227.2 +/- 43.6 minutes, P < 0.001). Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. The TPCSC group had no surgical complication, but the TPCB group revealed 2 cases with wound infection after surgery. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in loss of correction or implant failure, was also not significantly different (TPCB = 9.6% and TPCSC = 15%; P = 0.565). All patients with partial neurologic deficits initially improved at the final follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Additional TPCB grafting after posterior short-segment instrumentation remains a reliable surgical method for correcting and maintaining sagittal alignment and vertebral body height in thoracolumbar burst fractures. Calcium sulfate cement also proved to be an effective bone substitute used in spinal surgeries for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

To compare the clinical results of additional screws fixation on fractured vertebrae versus only short-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation for A3 thoracolumbar fracture without neurologic deficit.
Methods: 
Clinical data of 52 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were divided into 2 groups due to different instrumentation and all fractures were classified as type A3 according to AO Classification.From January 2005 to December 2006, 23 cases in group A were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation combined with additional screws fixation on fractured vertebrae. There were 18 male and 5 female with a mean age of (35.3+/-8.3) years. The fracture segment included 1 in T11, 9 in T12, 11 in L1 and 2 in L2. From January 1999 to December 2004, 29 cases in group B were treated only by conventional short-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation. There were 20 male and 9 female with a mean age of (37.3+/-6.8) years. The fracture segment included 1 in T11, 7 in T12, 20 in L1 and 1 in L2. The clinical effect and radiographic measurements were respectively compared preoperatively, immediate and 2 years postoperatively.
Results: 
All patients were followed up and the mean follow-up time was (37.4+/-10.9) months (from 24 to 48 months). There was no statistic difference of mean JOA and VAS score between 2 groups preoperatively, immediate and 2 years postoperatively (P>0.05). The average immediate postoperative correction of Cobb's angle was 13.7 degrees+/-7.7 degrees in group A, which was statistically significantly higher than that of 8.8 degrees+/-5.0 degrees in group B (P<0.01). The mean kyphosis correction loss of 2.9 degrees+/-1.5 degrees in group A was statistically significantly lower than that of 5.0 degrees+/-2.9 degrees in group B 2 years postoperatively (P<0.01). The average restoration of anterior height of fractured vertebral body immediate postoperatively was (29.4+/-6.0)% and (21.7+/-6.9)% respectively. The mean correction loss of anterior height 2 years postoperatively was (3.1+/-0.8)% and (6.6+/-3.0)% respectively. The average restoration of posterior height of fractured vertebral body immediate postoperatively was (8.5+/-3.2)% and (6.1+/-1.8)% respectively. The mean correction loss of posterior height 2 years postoperatively was (2.0+/-0.8)% and (3.4+/-1.0)% respectively. There were significant differences in average restoration of anterior/posterior height immediate postoperatively and correction loss of anterior/posterior height 2 years postoperatively between the 2 groups (P<0.01). According to fracture fragments protruded into the spinal canal on immediate postoperative CT image, there were complete reduction in 11 cases (47.8%) and partial reduction in 12 cases (52.2%) in group A, which was statistically significantly better than those in group B (P<0.01). There was no severe neurologic complications and no other complications related to additional screws fixation postoperatively. Pedicle screw breakage occurred in 2 cases in group B and none in group A.
Conclusions: 
Better initial kyphosis correction and less loss of correction 2 years after operation can be obtained by using additional screws fixation on fractured vertebra for thoracolumbar A3 fracture without neurologic deficit.},

  abstract={Background: 
The status of hip fracture incidence and treatment is well known through nationwide surveys in Japan. However, there have been no similar studies on spine fractures. Therefore, we investigated current medical practices for them.
Methods: 
Altogether, 1200 hospitals were randomly selected for the survey with consideration of region and hospital characteristics. Questionnaire items included the number of hospitalized spine patients, imaging test implementation, type of conservative treatment, use of open surgery and vertebroplasty, and the number of these procedures performed in 2005.
Results: 
Responses were received from 473 hospitals. On the day of response, there were 14 372 hospitalized orthopedic patients (average 32.8/hospital). Among them were 1403 spine fracture patients (3.1/hospital), accounting for 13.5% of orthopedic patients. Of them, 91.9% received conservative treatment. The mean percentage of spine fracture patients who were hospitalized was 39.5%. The most reliable imaging test was said to be magnetic resonance imaging. Casting or bracing was used in most of the institutions. The most common analgesic treatment was oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Open surgery and vertebroplasty were conducted for spine fractures in the elderly at 26.5% and 16.3% of hospitals, respectively. In these hospitals, 624 and 257 patients underwent open surgery and vertebroplasty, respectively, in 2005.
Conclusions: 
In Japan, more than 90% of elderly patients hospitalized with spine fractures received conservative treatment. Surgical treatment, either open surgery or vertebroplasty, was performed at 30% of the hospitals. This study provides basic data that will contribute to planning improvements in spinal fracture treatment in the elderly.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Although spinal fusion has been a touchstone of spinal fixation, nonfusion technique have become raising its popularity recently. Some studies suggested that nonfusion had several advantages over fusion. The aim of this prospective study was to compare long segment posterior instrumentation with fusion versus long-segment posterior instrumentation without fusion.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 42 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation with fusion (WF), whereas Group 2 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation without fusion (WOF). Long segment instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
Measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index and anterior vertebral height compression showed that both group had similar outcome at final follow-up. Moreover, there was no difference between the two groups according to low back outcome score. Also, implant failure rate (4.7%) was quite low in both groups. However, WF group had prolonged operative time, increased blood loss and donor site morbidity.
Conclusions: 
Radiological and clinical parameters demonstrated that spinal fusion is not necessary in long segment posterior instrumentation for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To explore the correlation between the inserting angle of vertebral screws and the extent of post-operative lateral angulation instantly in surgery via anterior approach for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
The clinical data were from 172 patients consecutively treated with surgery via anterior approach in thoracic and lumbar fractures between May 2004 and January 2008. These cases included 124 males and 48 females at the age of 15-70 years old (mean 39 years old). One fracture were located at T11, 37 at T12, 88 at L1, 30 at L2, 15 at L3, 3 at L4. One segment was involved in 170 cases and two segments in 2 cases. According to Frankel assessment for neurological status, there were 19 cases of grade A, 24 cases of grade B, 45 cases of grade C, 53 cases of grade D, and 31 cases of grade E. The time from injury to operation was 2-30 days (median 8 days). According to the coronal Cobb angle instantly after surgery, the patients were divided into three groups: 0-5 degrees group, 5-10 degrees group and over 10 degrees group. Every group was further divided into four subgroups according to the type of the internal fixation instruments: Z-plate subgroup, Antares subgroup, Profile subgroup and single screw rod (SSR) subgroup. Radiograph images were used to evaluate the coronal Cobb angle and inserting angle between the screws and end-plates. The screws were named as A, B, C and D in vertebral bodies from the cephalic to the caudal portion. The angles between the superior endplate and the screws A, B were named as angles A, B, and the angles between the inferior endplate and the screws C, D were named as angles C, D. The differences were compared between the screw's inserting angle A+D (or/and B+C) and the post-operative coronal Cobb angle instantly, and linear regression analysis was done. The satisfaction survey was accomplished.
Results: 
Surficial infection occurred in 1 patient at 7 days and incision healed well after debridement; other incisions healed by first intention. A total of 172 cases were followed up for 6-49 months (mean 39 months). The degree of satisfaction was 3-10 points, median 8.5 points. Various degrees of neurological function recovered in final follow-up except patients for Frankel A grade. The mean coronal Cobb angles were (0.75 +/- 3.91) degrees for pre-operatively, (3.17 +/- 4.07) degrees for instantly post-operatively and (3.46 +/- 4.21) degrees at last follow-up; showing statistically differences between pre-operatively and instantly post-operatively, between pre-operatively and at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Comparing the screw's inserting angle A+D (or/and B+C) and the coronal Cobb angle, there was statistically significant difference between Z-Plate subgroup and other subgroups in 0-5 degrees group (P < 0.05), and there were no statistically significant differences between other subgroups in each group (P > 0.05). Except the screw's inserting angle A+D (Z-Plate and SSR subgroups) and angle B+C (Antares subgroup) in 0-5 degrees group, the post-operative coronal Cobb angle correlated closely with the screw's inserting angle A+D (or/and B+C) in other subgroups of 3 groups.
Conclusion: 
Nonparallelism between the vertebral screws and the correlative end plate is one of the main causes of post-operative spinal lateral angulation.},

  abstract={Background: 
The timing of stabilization for thoracic spine injuries is discussed controversial. Although early repair of long bone fractures is known to reduce complications, few studies investigate this issue in spine trauma.
Methods: 
We retrospectively investigated 160 patients (January 2000 to March 2003) with spine fractures from Th1 to L1, which were stabilized. Patients were divided into two groups: early stabilization within 72 hours or later. Other subgroups were analyzed for the relationship of neurologic status, injury severity, and incidence of preoperative lung failure.
Results: 
: Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score >or=38 pts) with early stabilization had a significantly shorter intensive care unit-stay (14 days [1-34 days] vs. 20 days [1-39 days]; p < 0.05) and overall shorter hospital stay (56 days [9-147 days] vs. 108 days [11-198 days]; p < 0.05). Similar patterns were seen for patients with Frankel A deficits (Frankel Score) and preoperative lung failure. The clinical course of less severe-injured patients was not influenced at all.
Conclusions: 
Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of spine injuries is safe. In severely injured patients, it does not impair perioperative lung function and results in a reduced overall intensive care unit and hospital stay.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Surgical treatment in the case of thoracolumbar burst fractures is very controversial. Posterior instrumentation is most frequently used, however, but the number of levels to be instrumented still remains a matter of debate.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 94 patients who had a single burst fracture between T11 and L2 were selected and were managed using posterior instrumentation with anterior fusion when necessary. They were divided into three groups as follows; Group I (n = 28) included patients who were operated by intermediate segment fixation, Group II (n = 32) included patients operated by long segment fixation, and Group III (n = 34) included those operated by intermediate segment fixation with a pair of additional screws in the fractured vertebra. The mean follow-up period was twenty one months. The outcomes were analyzed in terms of kyphosis angle (KA), regional kyphosis angle (RA), sagittal index (SI), anterior height compression rate, Frankel classification, and Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire.
Results: 
In Groups II and III, the correction values of KA, RA, and SI were much better than in Group I. At the final follow up, the correction values of KA (6.3 and 12.1, respectively) and SI (6.2 and 12.0, respectively) were in Groups II and III found to be better in the latter.
Conclusion: 
The intermediate segment fixation with an additional pair of screws at the fracture level vertebra gives results that are comparable or even better than long segment fixation and gives an advantage of preserving an extra mobile segment.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A randomized, controlled follow-up study to review patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by anterior instrumentation and reconstruction.
Objective: 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of anterior instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures and to determine whether anterior-only approach would be sufficient for highly unstable burst fractures. In this prospective follow-up study, we also compared the results of anterior reconstruction with structural grafting and with titanium mesh cage in a randomized fashion.
Summary of background data: 
Anterior decompression and reconstruction supplemented with instrumentation is generally believed to be superior to fixation with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation for a highly unstable burst fracture, but the indications and methods for anterior approach has not been fully documented.
Methods: 
A total of 65 patients undergoing anterior plating for a thoracolumbar burst fracture with a load-sharing score of 7 or more between 2000 and 2003 were included this study. They were randomized to receive iliac crest autograft (group A, n = 32) or titanium mesh cages (group B, n = 33). The patients were similar in the distribution of 3-column injuries (n = 8 in group A vs. n = 9 in group B). During the minimum 4-year (range, 4-7 years) follow-up period, all patients were prospectively evaluated for clinical and radiologic outcomes. The Frankel scale, the ASIA motor score, and the Short Form 36 were used for clinical evaluation, whereas the fusion status and the loss of kyphosis correction for the local kyphosis angle were examined for radiologic outcome.
Results: 
All patients in this study achieved solid fusion, with significant neurologic improvement and no significant correction loss as defined by loss of kyphosis correction. The clinical and radiologic results were not significantly different (P > 0.05) at all time points between the 2 groups A and B. Twenty-six of 32 patients in group A still complained of donor site pain to some degree at the final follow-up. No significant impact of 3-column injuries (P > 0.05) were identified on the results for all comparisons.
Conclusion: 
Anterior-only instrumentation and reconstruction with structural autograft or titanium mesh cages is sufficient for surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with a load-sharing score of > or = 7 and even with 3-column injuries.},

  abstract={Study design: 
This is a retrospective chart review of 670 clinic notes from 202 patients who underwent posterior instrumented lumbar spinal fusions (LSF) over a 9-year period by a single surgeon.
Objective: 
This study's objective was to investigate the utility of routine radiographs in the first year after LSF to determine if they affect decision-making.
Summary of background data: 
A review of the literature reveals an absence of studies investigating the need for radiographs in the immediate postoperative period after LSF.
Methods: 
Each patient's history and physical examination (H/E) and the surgeon's interpretation of radiographs were graded as normal or abnormal for all postoperative visits in the first year after surgery. Further action taken not felt to be routine was also recorded. chi was used to statistically analyze the compiled data.
Results: 
No action was taken 100% of the time when H/E was normal and either a normal radiograph or no radiograph was taken. If the patient was H/E normal and radiographs were abnormal, further action was taken in only one instance. This occurred in a patient with asymptomatic implant dissociation who elected to undergo revision. In patients with abnormal H/E, further action was taken 72% of the time even in the presence of normal radiographs and 89% of the time when they also had abnormal radiographs. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups with abnormal H/E.
Conclusion: 
Routine radiographs seem to have limited utility in the early postoperative period after instrumented LSF and may place patients with normal H/E at an increased risk of undergoing unnecessary diagnostic studies. Patients with abnormal H/E were more likely to undergo more extensive testing leading to additional treatment being prescribed regardless of the interpretation of the radiographs.},

  abstract={Background: 
A loss of reduction due to inadequate support of the anterior column when using short-segment instrumentation to treat burst fracture and novel methods for support of the anterior column through a posterior approach to augment posterior instrumentation have been reported in the literature. We hypothesized that if anterior column support is an important adjunct to posterior short-segment instrumentation, then avoidance of axial load until sufficient anterior column healing occurs, allowing load-sharing with the implant, would improve spinal alignment at follow-up.
Methods: 
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which consecutive patients who had instrumentation and fusion with the AO spinal fixator were immediately ambulated after surgery or had 4 weeks of bedrest. We measured kyphosis and wedge angles preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and at the time of final follow-up. We used radiologic measures to assess instrumentation and bone failure.
Results: 
We found significant differences in the mean loss of wedge and kyphosis angle correction between patients immediately ambulated and those who had 4 weeks of bedrest (0.71 masculine v. - 4.73 masculine for wedge and 1.81 masculine v. - 6.55 masculine for kyphosis, respectively). There was significant correlation between instrumentation and bone failure in both the immediate ambulation and bedrest groups.
Conclusion: 
Bedrest improves the maintenance of intraoperative sagittal alignment correction, which is in agreement with the theory that inadequate support of the anterior spinal column is the mechanism for loss of reduction when using short-segment instrumentation to treat burst fractures. Therefore, addressing the anterior column directly through anterior surgery or by employing novel techniques in posterior surgery is recommended if one of the goals of treatment is to maintain the sagittal correction achieved at the time of surgery. Trying to achieve this goal by addressing posterior implant design or bone quality alone will not be successful because instrumentation and bone failure occur together.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective review of 12 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 18 patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) treated at a single institution for spinal injuries between the years 2000 and 2006.
Objective: 
To independently evaluate patients with these diagnoses who sustained spinal injuries and directly compare their treatment methods and clinical outcomes.
Summary of background data: 
AS and DISH are disorders characterized by abnormal ossification of the spinal column, which predisposes these patients to spinal injuries with potentially devastating consequences.
Methods: 
Patient and surgical data were obtained from medical records and appropriate imaging studies. Neurologic status was recorded using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale for spinal cord injuries, and clinical outcomes were assessed using Odom criteria.
Results: 
Most of these injuries involved the subaxial cervical spine between C5 and C7. In all, 41.2% of AS patients were considered to be ASIA A, whereas 44.4% of DISH patients were classified as ASIA E. Surgery was performed in 83.3% of AS patients and 66.7% of DISH patients, and the overall complication rates were 41.7% and 33.3%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the survivorship and outcomes of the AS and DISH groups and 81.3% of all respondents were classified as having excellent or good outcomes. There were 4 deaths, all of which were considered to be related to the use of halo-vest immobilization.
Conclusions: 
Although the rate of neurologic injury was high for both groups, AS patients were more likely to exhibit neurologic deficits and undergo operative management. Although the majority of these spinal injuries were treated surgically, stable fractures without any associated neurologic deficits were often successfully managed with immobilization. Complications were observed with both operative and nonoperative treatments, although all of the deaths occurred in conjunction with the use of the halo-vest orthosis.},

  abstract={Aim: 
Screw misplacement affects the stability of the internal fixateur and may cause neurovascular complications. However, only a computer tomographic scan can show the exact position of the screws. This study was undertaken to assess the reliability of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging (3-D) to view screw positions.
Method: 
The prospective study involved 34 patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures between June 2006 until July 2007 who underwent an intraoperative 3-D-imaging scan after pedicle screw placement. The positions of 136 screws were classified according to the axial view of the 3-D scan into 6 categories. Pedicle and corpus perforation of the screws were measured in 2-mm steps. The quality of the 3-D scan was classified into 3 groups. We compared the results with the screw positions in postoperative CT scans.
Results: 
The computer tomography showed 122 screws in correct positions. 14 screws were misplaced. The average time of the 3-D procedure was 9.6 minutes. In axial C-arm reconstructions, 121 correct positions and 11 malpositions were classified correctly. With regard to the used classification a sensitivity of 3-D-imaging for all screws was 90.0 % and specificity was 97.6 %. The screw position was classified correctly by intraoperative scan in 97.1 % (132/136). 3 of 4 malclassified screws were in the thoracic spine segment (T 1-T 10). Absolute conformity between computer tomography and 3-D imaging classification was reached when the scan quality was good. The quality of 3-D imaging correlated significantly with pedicle diameter (p = 0.004), BMI of the patients (p = 0.001) and the spine level (p = 0.001). Wide pedicles, spine level T 11-L 5 and a low BMI lead to a good quality of scans.
Conclusion: 
Intraoperative imaging by 3-D fluoroscopy can predict very exactly the position of pedicle screws, especially, when a good scan quality is available and the spine section viewed is T 11-L 5. The scan offers the advantage of immediate correction of screw malposition. Thus, computer tomography to control pedicle screw position is dispensable.},

RCTs and CCTs were included. Data were extracted by two reviewers with designed extraction form. RevMan 4.2.8 software was used for data analysis.
Results: 
Two RCTs and four prospective clinical trials were included. The combined results showed that compare with posterior surgical management, anterior approach in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures proved the less incidence of complications; better neurologic recovery and corrected kyphosis angle; more complete and reliable decompression of the canal. However, there was not difference between the two groups in the general status outcomes.
Conclusions: 
To compare with posterior fixation system, anterior surgical managements in the thoracolumbar spinal trauma might be the optimal choices because the lower rates of complications and loss of corrected kyphosis angle; better neurologic recovery, also. Besides, due to the lack of Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of thoracolumbar spinal injuries, the results which indicated above need further study.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the therapeutic effect of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior lateral fusion (PLF) in treatment of thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation.
Methods: 
From January 2005 to July 2007, 35 patients (22 males, 13 females, aged 17-53 years old) with thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation (T11-L3) received posterior open reduction and pedicle nail-stick system internal fixation. Among which, 14 patients underwent TLIF (group TLIF), and the rest 21 patients underwent PLF (group PLF). According to AO classification, group TLIF had 3 cases of A3, 7 cases of B and 4 cases of C, while group PLF had 4 cases of A3, 10 cases of B and 7 cases of C. Based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scoring Standard formulated in 2000, the motor score of group TLIF and group PLF was (50.6 +/- 3.6) and (50.8 +/- 4.2) points, respectively; and the sensory score was (170.5 +/- 42.7) and (153.8 +/- 23.7) points, respectively. No significant difference was noted between 2 groups in general information (P > 0.05).
Results: 
The operation time of group TLIF and group PLF was (316 +/- 32) minutes and (254 +/- 27) minutes, and the blood loss of group TLIF and group PLF was (487 +/- 184) mL and (373 +/- 72) mL, indicating there were significant differences between 2 groups (P < 0.05). Wounds of all patients were healed by first intention and there was no death, aggravation of neurological function impairment and complication of internal fixation instrument loosening and breaking. All 35 cases were followed up for 9-23 months with an average of 14.6 months. Postoperatively, the thoracolumbar bone fusion rate of group TLIF and group PLF was 100% and 85.7%, respectively, indicating there was a significant difference (P < 0.05). At 3 months after operation, the motor score of group TLIF and group PLF was increased by (10.4 +/- 10.0) and (9.4 +/- 9.3) points, respectively; and the sensory score was upgraded by (26.5 +/- 22.8) and (28.8 +/- 28.4) points, respectively, showing there were no significant difference (P > 0.05). At immediate moment, 3, 6 and 12 months after operation, the spine height restoration of group TLIF was (5.4 +/- 2.1), (5.4 +/- 1.9), (5.4 +/- 1.4) and (5.3 +/- 1.3) mm, respectively; while it was (5.3 +/- 2.6), (5.3 +/- 2.2), (4.8 +/- 3.1) and (4.2 +/- 3.6) mm for group PLF. Meanwhile, the Cobb angle recovery of group TLIF was (14.5 +/- 3.5), (14.5 +/- 3.6), (14.4 +/- 3.4) and (14.4 +/- 3.6) degrees, respectively; while it was (14.3 +/- 2.7), (14.2 +/- 3.1), (12.2 +/- 2.8) and (11.7 +/- 3.3) degrees for group PLF. Concerning the spine height restoration and the Cobb angle recovery, no significant difference was observed between 2 groups at immediate moment and 3 months after operation (P > 0.05), but significant differences were noted at 6 and 12 months after operation (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
For the treatment of thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation, TLIF is superior to PLF in bony fusion and restoration of spine column height.},

  abstract={Background: 
To examine the efficacy of early versus late spinal fracture fixation, we reviewed National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) records to identify the breakpoint in reported timing of operative fixation. Using this breakpoint we then analyzed outcome for those treated early versus late, hypothesizing that the early group would experience better outcome as reflected by resource utilization and complications.
Methods: 
The NTDB was queried for patients with any level spinal fracture that required surgical stabilization. Histogram analysis of the postinjury day of initial operative fixation was used to determine the point at which the majority of operative procedures had been performed, thereby defining early (E) and late (L) groups. Patients in E were matched to a cohort from L with similar age, Injury Severity Score, and Glasgow Coma Scale. Outcome data included hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, charges, incidence of complications, and mortality. The groups were compared using Student's t test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, accepting p < or = 0.05 as significant.
Results: 
Of 16,812 patients who underwent operative fixation, 59% were completed within 3 days of injury and formed E. The 374 L patients whose dataset was complete enough to allow analysis were matched to 497 E patients. There was no significant difference in the presence of spinal cord injury between E and L (51 vs. 48%; p = 0.3735). Complications were significantly higher in L (30% vs. 17.5%; p < 0.0001) yet mortality was similar in both groups (2.0% vs.1.9%; p > 0.05).
Conclusions: 
NTDB records indicate that the majority of patients with spinal fractures undergo operative fixation within 3 days, and that these patients had less complications and required less resources. Use of a national data bank to compare groups with similar injury severity and presenting physiology can validate best practice and define opportunities for improvement in care.},

  abstract={Background: 
Development of transpedicular screw fixation techniques and instrumentation systems has brought short-segment instrumentation (fixation of one normal vertebra above and below an injured segment) into general clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to report the surgical outcome of thoracolumber fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of all surgically managed thoracolumbar fractures during two years was performed. The 84 surgically managed patients were instrumented by the short-segment technique. Patients charts, operation notes, preoperative and postoperative radiographs, computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done. Neurological findings (Frankel functional classification), and follow-up records up to 6 months were reviewed.
Results: 
Transpedicular fixation was performed in 84 cases including 52 male and 32 female with male to female ratio 1.6:1. Mean +/- SD of age was 40 +/- 13.75 years (range 15-60). The level of injuries was different in different age groups. Outcome was assessed on Frankle grading. No patient showed an increase in neurological deficit. Most of the patients showed improvement to the next grade. Screw breakage occurred in 8 cases, bed sores in 16 cases and deep vein thrombosis in 3 cases. Misplaced screw in 5 cases. Eight cases got wound infection.
Conclusion: 
Although long- term follow-up evaluation needs to verified, the short-term follow-up results suggest a favourable outcome for short-segment instrumentation.},

  abstract={Background: 
In anterior reconstruction of the unstable thoracolumbar spine, discectomy and corpectomy are technically demanding steps requiring maximal surgical precision. This study investigated the feasibility of computer-aided guidance for discectomy and corpectomy. It also analysed the precision, advantages, and disadvantages of the procedure.
Patients and methods: 
Vertebral body fractures of the non-osteoporotic thoracolumbar spine addressed by discectomy/corpectomy and subsequent implant interposition (cage, tricortical strut graft) for anterior reconstruction were included. All surgical steps were done under endoscopic assistance. In the trial group, discectomy and corpectomy were performed with computer-aided guidance; in the control group, no computer navigation was used. The time required for surgery was noted. To assess surgical precision, decentralization of the implant in the frontal plane was measured in postoperative x-rays and computed tomography. Additionally, parallel alignment of vertebral body end plates with the implant was evaluated.
Results: 
The trial group (TG) consisted of 16 patients, and the control group (CG) of 10 patients. Fractures were localized between T10 and L1 in TG, and between T9 and L1 in CG. Operating time was significantly shorter in CG: 104+/-28 min compared with 229+/-64 min in TG (p<0.0005). In contrast, data on surgical precision showed no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for either decentralization or parallel endplate alignment of implants. Remarkably, for CG we noted 2 cases of cage subsidence into an adjacent end plate, whereas for TG this was noted in only 1 case. However, this difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: 
Computer-aided guidance for anterior reconstruction of the thoracolumbar spine is a technically feasible option that may help in performing discectomy and corpectomy. However, this technique significantly prolongs the operating time. There were no differences in the precision of implant positioning between the groups. However, during discectomy the use of computer navigation may possibly add to the protection of adjacent end plates.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare clinical outcome of the percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture with neurological intact.
Methods: 
Sixty patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit underwent either percutaneous (n = 30) or traditional open pedicle screw fixation (n = 30). Radiographs obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, 4 months and 2 years after surgery were used to access the restoration of spinal anatomy. Also, operation time, blood loss, blood drainage, hospital stay and soft tissue dissection were evaluated. The level of pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), function by the Oswestry questionnaire.
Results: 
The average followed up was 2 years. There were no significant differences between both groups concerning age, sex, cause of injury and the presence of other severe injuries. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in blood loss, blood drainage, hospital stay and soft tissue dissection (P < 0.01), whereas no significant differences in operation time (P > 0.05). The vertebral height, the kyphosis angle, and the occupation of spinal canal after surgery and at follow-up were not significantly (P > 0.05). The pain systems and functions were similar in both groups at final follow-up (P > 0.05), however, less pain was found in the percutaneous group than that in the open group at the first 3 months after surgery (P < 0.01).
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fracture has the advantage of less trauma, quickly recovery and better esthetic outcome, however, it has the same results with the traditional open produce after 2 years of surgery.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The ideal timing of spinal fixation is controversial. A recent study showed that early spine fixation reduced morbidity and resource utilization. We previously noted a trend toward higher mortality in patients undergoing early spinal fixation. This study was done to analyze whether the timing of spinal fixation had a significant effect on mortality.
Methods: 
The registry of our Level I trauma program was queried for all patients with at least one spinal vertebral injury. Anatomic and physiologic variables included age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Injury Severity Score. Outcome was evaluated in terms of ventilator days, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality. Patients were stratified by day of spinal operative fixation as early when done within 48 hours and late when done after 48 hours. Data were analyzed using chi and an unpaired t test, accepting p < 0.05 as significant.
Results: 
Three hundred sixty-one patients between January 1988 and February 2003 required operative spinal fixation (158 early, within 48 hours vs. 203 late, beyond 48 hours). There was no significant difference between the two groups except mortality, which was significantly higher in the early group (7.6 vs. 2.5%; p = 0.0257), and HLOS, which was significantly shorter in the early group (14.42 vs. 17.64 days; p = 0.025).
Conclusion: 
Spinal fixation within 48 hours after vertebral fractures and dislocations appears to increase mortality despite similar anatomic and physiologic parameters in the later operative group. Incomplete resuscitation of patients before surgery may have contributed to this result. The shorter HLOS may have been because of the higher number of early deaths. Prospective studies to identify the optimal timing of spinal fixation and the reason for these outcome differences are warranted.},

Thirty-three patients were divided into four groups: short-term percutaneous pedicle screw fixation group, short-term open pedicle screw fixation group, long-term percutaneous pedicle screw fixation group, and long-term open pedicle screw fixation group. Paraspinal muscle were studied by needle electromyography and CT. Cross-sectional area and color grade information of paraspinal muscle were measured using CT image.
Results: 
The area and color grade of paraspinal muscle changed significantly after surgery. The color grade of paraspinal muscle showed significant change while the muscle area observed no significant change in the two short-term groups; There was significant change in paraspinal muscle area, however no significant change was found in muscle color grade of the two long-term groups. In electromyography study the results showed that there was significant difference in the two short-term groups, however no significant difference existed in the long-term groups. There was no significant difference of patients treated by the two surgical technique in long-term function evaluation.

To assess the therapeutic effects of thoracic-lumbar fracture fixation with percutaneous mini-invasive pedicle screw system guided by computer navigation.
Method: 
Fifty-one thoracic-lumbar fracture patients were divided into two groups: Sextant group (n = 21) undergoing percutaneous screw fixation with a minimally invasive pedicle screw system, and conventional pedicle screw fixation group (n = 30). The differences in the incision size, average blood loss during operation, surgical time, time of resuming walking after operation, numerical analogous pain score, etc. were analyzed.
Results: 
The incision length of the sextant group was 2.4 +/- 0.41 cm, significantly shorter than that of the conventional pedicle screw fixation group (17.4 +/- 3.4 cm, P < 0.001). The average blood loss during operation of the sextant group was 114 +/- 67.4 ml, significantly less than that of the conventional pedicle screw fixation group (317 +/- 113.2 ml, P < 0.001). The surgical time of the sextant group was 2.1 +/- 0.4 hr, significantly shorter than that of the conventional pedicle screw fixation group (2.7 +/- 0.7, P < 0.05). The time of resuming walking after operation of the sextant group was 2.0 +/- 0.7 d, significantly shorter than that of the conventional pedicle screw fixation group (7.2 +/- 2.5 d, P < 0.001). The postoperative NAPS was significantly lower than that before operation in both groups, however, there was no significant difference in the improvement of NAPS between the two groups.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation using mini-invasive pedicle screw system guided by computer navigation is a good surgical therapeutic choice in thoracic-lumbar fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Proper timing of stabilization for spinal injuries is discussed controversially. Whereas early repair of long bone fractures is known to reduce complications, few studies exist that investigate this issue in acute spinal trauma. In particular, the importance of coexisting lung injuries has to be determined, as it might influence clinical course and outcome.
Material and methods: 
We investigated retrospectively 30 severely injured patients who were stabilized dorsally for fractures of the thoracic and upper lumbar spine. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 41 points. Patients were divided into two groups: group I: acute trauma/stabilization <72 h and group II: acute trauma/stabilization >72 h. All patients in groups I and II presented radiological or clinical signs of lung contusion.
Results: 
The average duration of the procedures in group I was 199 min (115-312 min) and in group II 139 min (98-269 min). Intraoperative blood loss and P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2)-ratio did not differ significantly between the two groups. The overall in ICU and hospital stay was significantly shorter in group I: 16 days (1-78 days) versus 24 days (7-86 days) in the late group II. Postoperative respirator therapy was necessary in group I for 15 days (0-79 days) and in group II for 19 days (4-31 days). The mortality rate was 10% in this series.
Conclusion: 
Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of spinal injuries is safe in severely injured patients, does not impair perioperative lung function, and results in a reduced overall ICU and hospital stay. Further prospective randomized investigations are warranted to prove these results.},

  abstract={The treatment of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. A review of the literature showed that short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) alone led to a high incidence of implant failure and correction loss. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the outcomes of the SS- and long-segment posterior fixation (LSPF) in unstable thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12-L2) in Magerl Type A fractures. The patients were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group I included 32 patients treated by SSPF (four screws: one level above and below the fracture), and Group II included 31 patients treated by LSPF (eight screws: two levels above and below the fracture). Clinical outcomes and radiological parameters (sagittal index, SI; and canal compromise, CC) were compared according to demographic features, localizations, load-sharing classification (LSC) and Magerl subgroups, statistically. The fractures with more than 10 degrees correction loss at sagittal plane were analyzed in each group. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, LSC, SI, and CC preoperatively. The mean follow-ups were similar for both groups, 36 and 33 months, respectively. In Group II, the correction values of SI, and CC were more significant than in Group I. More than 10 degrees correction loss occurred in six of the 32 fractures in Group I and in two of the 31 patients in Group II. SSPF was found inadequate in patients with high load sharing scores. Although radiological outcomes (SI and CC remodeling) were better in Group II for all fracture types and localizations, the clinical outcomes (according to Denis functional scores) were similar except Magerl type A33 fractures. We recommend that, especially in patients, who need more mobility, with LSC point 7 or less with Magerl Type A31 and A32 fractures (LSC point 6 or less in Magerl Type A3.3) without neurological deficit, SSPF achieves adequate fixation, without implant failure and correction loss. In Magerl Type A33 fractures with LSC point 7 or more (LSC points 8-9 in Magerl Type A31 and A32) without severe neurologic deficit, LSPF is more beneficial.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Multicenter prospective randomized trial.
Objective: 
To test the hypotheses that thoracolumbar AO Type A spine fractures without neurologic deficit, managed with short-segment posterior stabilization will show an improved radiographic outcome and at least the same functional outcome as compared with nonsurgically treated thoracolumbar fractures.
Summary of background data: 
There are various opinions regarding the ideal management of thoracolumbar Type A spine fractures without neurologic deficit. Both operative and nonsurgical approaches are advocated.
Methods: 
Patients were randomized for operative or nonsurgical treatment. Data sampling involved demographics, fracture classifications, radiographic evaluation, and functional outcome.
Results: 
Sixteen patients received nonsurgical therapy, and 18 received surgical treatment. Follow-up was completed for 32 (94%) of the patients after a mean of 4.3 years. At the end of follow-up, both local and regional kyphotic deformity was significantly less in the operatively treated group. All functional outcome scores (VAS Pain, VAS Spine Score, and RMDQ-24) showed significantly better results in the operative group. The percentage of patients returning to their original jobs was found to be significantly higher in the operative treated group.
Conclusions: 
Patients with a Type A3 thoracolumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit should be treated by short-segment posterior stabilization.},

The purpose of this review is to clarify some of the controversy about the timing of surgical fracture fixation in spinal trauma. Better neurological outcome, shorter hospital stay and fewer complications have been reported after early fracture fixation. But there are also studies showing no difference in neurological outcome when compared to late treatment. Mortality is another controversial point since a recent report of higher mortality in early treated patients. A systematic review of the literature was preformed. Ten articles were included. Early fracture fixation is associated with less complications, shorter hospital and ICU stay. The effect of early treatment on the neurological outcome remains unclear due to the contradictory results of the included studies. Early thoracic and lumbar fracture fixation results in improvement of clinical outcome, but the effect on neurological outcome remains controversial.},

  keywords={Thoracic Vertebrae, Spinal Fractures, Lumbar Vertebrae, Humans, Fracture Fixation},
  abstract={Background: 
Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest, and immobilization with a brace once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilization of the fracture with screws, often with decompression, an operation to remove bone fragments which have intruded into the vertebral canal.
Objectives: 
To compare operative with non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Search strategy: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (May 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2005), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) available at http://cbm.imicams.ac.cn (January 1978 to April 2005). We also searched reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted authors where necessary.
Selection criteria: 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing operative with non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Pooling of data was not carried out as only one small, poor quality trial was included.
Main results: 
We included one trial comparing operative with non-operative treatment (53 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in pain and function-related outcomes, rates of return to work, radiographic findings or average length of hospitalization at final follow up. The rate of complications was higher for the patients treated operatively. The degree of kyphosis or the percentage of correction lost did not correlate with any clinical symptoms at the time of the final follow up. Average costs related to hospitalization and treatment in the operative group appeared to be more than in the non-operative group.
Authors' conclusions: 
There was no statistically significant difference on the functional outcome two years or more after therapy between operative and non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. However, this review was able to include only one randomized controlled trial with a small sample size and poor quality, which precluded firm conclusions. More research with high quality trials is needed.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The decision on the surgical approach in the operative treatment of the fractures of thoracolumbar spine is possible only by following a detailed classification. However, the application of the classification systems is not reliable without a complex imagination of the bony and fibrous structures involved into the fracture. Pre-op investigation should include x-rays, CT-scans and MRI.
Material and methods: 
Patient series consists of 21 females and 43 males treated surgically for the unstable thoracolumbar fracture during 2001. The average age was 43 years. Patients suffering form osteoporosis, fresh spinal cord injury and multiple spine fractures were excluded. All fractures were examined by plain x-rays, CT-scans and MRI and classified according the AO-ASIF classification system. In patients with A-type fractures the single anterior approach was used. Patients with B- or C-type of fracture were operated by the posterior approach. These fractures were complementary classified according to the Load-sharing classification and those with 6 or more points were additionally operated also from the front. Patients were divided into the three groups: the anterior approach (22 pts), the combined procedure (22 pts) and the posterior approach (20 pts). In the third group, the hardware was removed after 15 months on average. No posterolateral fusion was carried out. Minimum follow-up was 22 months.
Results: 
No implant failure was found in any patient. No significant loss of correction was found in the first and the second group. The loss of correction in the third group was 3.1 degree on average.
Conclusion: 
Overall graphical imagination of the thoracolumbar fractures (including MRI) is essential for their classification. The classification helps to choose the optimum surgical approach. The approach related to the fracture classification prevents the treatment failure.},

Ten cases were treated conservatively (group A), eight cases were operated on at only one level (group B), and 12 cases were treated surgically at both levels (group C). All cases were followed up for 14-60 months (mean 32 months). Initial mobilisation with a wheelchair or crutches in group A was 9.2 +/- 1.1 weeks, which was significantly longer than groups B and C with 6.8+/-0.7 weeks and 3.1 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. Operative time and blood loss in group C were significantly more than group B. The neurological deficit improved in six cases in group A (60%), six in group B (75%) and eight in group C (80%). Correction of kyphotic deformity was significantly superior in groups C and B at the operated level, and increasing deformity occurred in groups A and B at the non-operated level. From the results we believe that three treatment strategies were suitable for multilevel noncontiguous spinal fractures, and individualised treatment should be used in these patients. In the patients treated surgically, the clinical and radiographic outcomes are much better.},

  abstract={Background context: 
To our knowledge, the presence of noncontiguous fracture-dislocation of the lumbosacral spine occurring at two levels has not been reported. The etiology, evaluation, and treatment of the unusual injury is presented.
Purpose: 
To notify spinal traumatologists about the possibility of this unusual injury.
Study design: 
A case report of an unusual noncontiguous double fracture-dislocation of the lumbosacral spine.
Methods: 
A 26-year-old man was involved in a motor vehicle accident where his car fell over a bridge and plummeted approximately 300 feet before hitting the ground. The patient was transported to a major medical center where he was found to be conscious, and amazingly, his only major injury was fracture-dislocations of L2-L3 and L5-S1. His preoperative neurologic status showed a partial paraparesis to all motor groups of the lower extremities bilaterally.
Results: 
The patient underwent a posterior reduction, instrumentation, and fusion from L1 to S1 with autogenous bone graft and segmental pedicle screw instrumentation. One week postoperatively, he underwent an anterior spinal fusion of L5/S1. Postoperatively, his neurologic status improved allowing him to be ambulatory, with a normal lumbosacral alignment being well-maintained.
Conclusions: 
Noncontiguous double fracture-dislocation of the lumbosacral spine is an unusual injury, which results from a very high-energy trauma. Prompt recognition of the injuries, reduction of the fracture-dislocations, and posterior stabilization is recommended for neural decompression, spinal alignment, and long-term stabilization.},

  abstract={Object: 
The authors undertook a retrospective cohort study of patients with T11-L2 thoracolumbar burst fractures who underwent decompression and the placement of instrumentation via the anterolateral or posterior approach.
Methods: 
There were 63 thoracolumbar burst fractures in 45 male and 18 female patients. The instrumentation was placed posteriorly in 25 patients and anterolaterally in 38. The mean follow-up duration after discharge from the hospital was 1.8 years (range 6 months-8 years). The mean preoperative Frankel scores in the anterolateral and posterior groups were 3.7 +/- 1.1 and 3.5 +/- 1.4, respectively (p = 0.4155). Preoperative angular deformity in the anterolateral and posterior groups measured 11.9 +/- 9.7 and 4.1 +/- 7.1 degrees, respectively (p = 0.0007).

Conclusions: 
Rigid guidelines for the selection of anterior or posterior approaches are lacking. Evaluation of the authors' results and those of others shows that angular deformity is more successfully corrected and maintained when the anterior approach is used.},

  abstract={Object: 
Despite extensive published research on thoracolumbar burst fractures, controversy still surrounds which is the most appropriate treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature on operative and nonoperative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and no neurological deficit.
Methods: 
In their search of the literature, the authors identified all possible relevant studies concerning thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit. Two independent observers performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction in a blinded and objective manner for all papers identified during the search. In a synthesis of the literature, the authors obtained evidence for both operative and nonoperative treatments.
Conclusions: 
There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the superiority of one approach over the other as measured using generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life scales. There is no scientific evidence linking posttraumatic kyphosis to clinical outcomes. The authors found that there is a strong need for improved clinical research methodology to be applied to this patient population.},

  abstract={Background: 
Proper timing of stabilization for spine injuries is discussed controversially. Whereas early repair of long bone fractures is known to reduce complications.
Patients and methods: 
We investigated retrospectively 48 patients who were stabilized in a ventrodorsal approach for fractures of the thoracic spine. Patients were divided into three groups. All patients in groups I and II presented radiological or clinical signs of lung contusion. Patients were stabilized in the prone position via single-step dorsal stabilization with internal transpedicular fixation and ventral fusion with titanium cage or autologous bone graft using a minimally invasive video-assisted thoracotomy.
Results: 
The average duration of the procedures in group I was 213+/-40 min, in group II 250+/-75 min, and in group III 255+/-65 min (p: n.s.). Intraoperative blood loss did not differ significantly between the three groups. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio improved in groups I and III, whereas in group II an significant impairment of lung function occurred perioperatively. Postoperative ICU stay was comparable in groups I and II (I: 10+/-5 days; II: 9+/-7 days); overall ICU stay tended to be shorter in group I versus II. The postoperative dependence on ventilator support did not differ significantly among the three groups. The mortality rate was 0% in this series.
Conclusion: 
Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of combined thoracic and thoracic spine injuries is safe, does not alter perioperative lung function, and results in a reduced overall ICU stay.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective clinical study.
Objective: 
To evaluate whether a percutaneous dorsal instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures prevents irreversible damage to the spinal muscles.
Methods: 
A total of 57 patients with thoracolumbar fractures (Th12-L4) were divided into two groups, comparable in terms of gender, fracture level, classification and surgical concept. In the first, 24/57 patients were treated using an open procedure (OP-G); in the second, 33/57 were treated via percutaneous dorsal instrumentation (PER-G). Fracture localisation and classification, accuracy of pedicle screw placement, perioperative blood loss, OR- and image converter time as well as muscle damage (needle-EMG) were evaluated.
Results: 
OR- and image converter time as well as the accuracy of pedicle screw placement were not statistically different between groups. The difference in perioperative blood loss [43 (10-90) ml (PER-G) vs [870 (570-1,200 ml (OP-G)] was statistically significant (P <0.005). Needle EMG revealed no muscle damage, and the physiological activity and muscle potentials were normal (PER-G). In the OP-G, polyphasic EMG signals were most common (80%), a sign of the drop-out of numerous motor units.
Conclusions: 
The open procedure caused permanent and significant damage to the strongest extensors of the autochthonus back musculature, the m. multifidus, which results from multisegment combined damage to the r. posterior nervi spinalis and muscle fibres. In contrast, percutaneous placement of an internal fixative reduces perioperative access morbidity causing little iatrogenic damage to back muscles and only a minor perioperative blood loss.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Short-segment (SS) pedicle fixation has become a popular treatment option. However, there are several studies regarding the high rate of failure. The aim of this prospective study was to compare SS versus long-segment (LS) instrumentation.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 18 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included nine patients treated by SS pedicle fixation, whereas group 2 included nine patients treated by LS instrumentation. SS instrumentation was pedicle fixation one level above and below the fractured vertebra. LS instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
As a result, measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index, and anterior vertebral height compression showed that the LS group had a better outcome at final follow-up (P < 0.05). Also, the SS group had a 55% failure rate, whereas the LS group had prolonged operative time and increased blood loss. However, there was no difference between the two groups according to Low Back Outcome Score.
Conclusions: 
In conclusion, radiographic parameters demonstrated that LS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Nevertheless, clinical outcome was the same between the two groups. However, our conclusions were based on posterior-only surgery. Anterior column support would negate the need for LS fixation. Also, SS would have been more successful if two above and two below pedicle screws were used.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
The efficiency of short-segment fixation with a transpedicle body augmenter for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures was retrospectively evaluated. Patients included in the study had limited neurologic function, a single-level burst fracture involving T11-L2, and no distraction or rotation trauma. Patients in the control group (n = 45) were treated with short-segment posterior instrumentation alone, whereas patients in the augmented group (n = 75) were treated with a titanium block designed for transpedicle body reconstruction. The followup was 24-70 months. The operation time and blood loss were similar in both groups. The immediate postoperative anterior vertebral restoration rate of the augmented group was similar to that of the control group (96.8% +/- 2.1% versus 96.7% +/- 3.0%). The final anterior vertebral restoration was greater in the augmented group than in the control group (93.7% +/- 3.0% versus 66.3% +/- 10.5%).

The final kyphotic angles were less in the augmented group than the control group (6.7 degrees +/- 3.0 degrees versus 19.6 degrees +/- 5.1 degrees). The control group had more implant failures than the augmented group. The augmented group had better results according to the Denis pain scale. Posterior body reconstruction with a transpedicle body augmenter can maintain kyphosis correction and vertebral restoration, prevent implant failure, and lead to better clinical results.
Level of evidence: 
Therapeutic study, Level III-2 (retrospective cohort study). See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Surgical treatment for thoracolumbar union instability represents a challenge, due to the difficult access to this area of the spine, and to the extreme variability of morphological and biomechanical lesions observed.
Aim: 
To describe the indications and clinical and neuroradiological results obtained with procedures of anterior or combined spinal fusion-instrumentation used for the treatment of instable thoracolumbar lesions.
Patients and methods: 
17 patients with thoracolumbar instability were treated surgically, being followed-up at least for one year. Causes of instability were classified in three groups: (i) fractures or fracture-luxations (n = 7), (ii) pathologic fractures following tumoral invasion (n = 6) and (iii) infectious or degenerative spondylodiscitis (n = 5). In order to carry out the substitution of the injured vertebral body an anterior approach to the thoracolumbar union was performed in all cases, using a modified technique of thoracophrenolaparotomy in which the diaphragmatic dome was not incised. Depending on the number of columns of Denis damaged, the vertebral corpectomy was followed by either an anterolateral or a combined spinal fusion-instrumentation.
Results: 
Pain in standing position was eliminated postoperatively in 83%. Neurological deficits were improved in 50% of cases. Surgical mortality was null and transient postoperative complications occurred in 11.7% of patients, but no lung atelectasis or respiratory infections were observed.
Conclusions: 
Chronic pain associated to thoracolumbar instability can be treated successfully by substitution of the damaged vertebral body followed by anterior or combined spinal fusion-instrumentation. Thoracophrenolaparotomy without division of the diaphragm is feasible and it reduces the morbidity associated to postoperative respiratory complications.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures who were surgically treated with an anterior corpectomy and fusion with anterolateral Z-plate fixation.
Objectives: 
To evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of the management of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures by corpectomy, structural grafting, and anterolateral internal fixation.
Summary of background data: 
Burst fractures are frequently associated with instability or neurologic deficit. Modern surgical procedures for these fractures have been performed via both anterior and posterior approaches. Anterior surgical treatment allows direct decompression of the neural elements and correction of deformity. Newer anterior instrumentation devices, combined with a structural graft, allow a stable construct that may obviate a posterior procedure. An anterior procedure generally requires fusion of only two levels compared to posterior fusion, which generally requires more.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with anterior surgery, strut graft, and fixation with a Z-plate was carried out. Fractures were considered acute if surgically treated within 30 days. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed on all 35 patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. Surgical indications were incomplete neurologic deficit, segmental kyphotic deformity, or significant comminution. All patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures with spinal cord injury were treated with an intravenous steroid protocol and were operated on within 24 hours of admission unless medically precluded. Forty-six percent (16 of 35) of patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures presented with a neurologic deficit.
Results: 
All 16 patients with neurologic deficit demonstrated at least one Frankel grade improvement on final observation, with 11 (69%) patients demonstrating complete neurologic recovery. Thirty-three patients were treated with anterolateral instrumentation only. Twenty-nine of thirty patients demonstrated radiographic healing. Five were lost to follow-up observation. One patient required subsequent posterior fusion for increasing kyphotic deformity. There were no instances of hardware failure. Sagittal alignment was improved from a mean preoperative kyphosis of 18 degrees to 6 degrees at final follow-up observation.
Conclusions: 
Anterior corpectomy, strut graft, and Z-plate fixation is an effective treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures. It allows direct decompression of the spinal cord in the acute setting and was associated with a high rate of neurologic improvement, no instances of neurologic worsening in any case, and a low complication rate.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Dorsal stabilisation has represented the standard procedure for the treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine for a long time, but in the last few years the combined dorsoventral stabilisation has gained in significance due to its higher mechanical stability. However, there are no data yet available indicating whether the patients benefit from the combined operation with regard to their postoperative quality of life and what the advantages are in comparison with the dorsal procedures. Therefore, the question was researched in the framework of a matched-pairs analysis of patients suffering from an unstable fracture of the thoracolumbar transition.
Materials and methods: 
From a consecutive series of patients treated in our clinic between 1995 and 2000, 10 patients with combined and 10 patients with a purely dorsal stabilisation were selected and included in the study. Their quality of life was summed up in retrospect with the SF-36 questionnaire. The X-rays were analysed, and the Cobb angle as well as the sagittal index were calculated. Only patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar transition without accompanying co-morbidity and neurological deficits were included in the study. Both of the treated groups were matched with regard to sex, age and radiological patterns of injury.
Results: 
Patients who had undergone only a dorsal stabilisation showed a significant loss of correction according to the sagittal index at the time of the examination (0.88+/-0.02 postoperative vs 0.77+/-0.03 at 4 years postoperatively, p=0.01). In the group of patients treated with the combined therapy, there was no statistically relevant loss of correction with regard to the sagittal vertebral profile. The SF-36 questionnaire showed a reduced quality of life in both groups compared with an age-referenced norm population, especially concerning the parameters of bodily health. No statistically relevant difference was observed between the two groups. Further, there was no statistically relevant association between the parameters of the SF-36 and the clinical and radiological data. After performing several regression analyses it could be shown that the patient's mental health is a strong predictor of the postoperative vitality (r=0.803, p<0.01). However, none of the remaining parameters was able to predict the postoperative quality of life.
Conclusion: 
The patients in this study showed a reduced quality of life, independent of the method of surgical treatment. Although better radiological results could be seen for the combined procedure, regarding the postoperative quality of life no advantage could be proved compared with the dorsally stabilized patients. Furthermore, there was no relation between the radiological results and the quality of life parameters. Therefore, it can be assumed that the injury itself seems to be the main cause of the decreased quality of life after a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar transition.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A systematic review of the literature, pertaining surgical treatment of traumatic thoracic and lumbar spine fractures, was performed.
Objectives: 
To provide information on surgical techniques for traumatic spine fracture management, their respective performance and complication rates, based on previously published information.
Summary of background data: 
The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to choose between the various surgical options. In absence of conclusive studies, a systematic review can be an alternative to obtain more convincing information.
Methods: 
Full-text papers from 1970 until 2001 were included if strict inclusion criteria were met. Five surgical subgroups were recognized: posterior short-segment (PS), posterior long-segment (PL), reports on both posterior short- and long-segment (PSL), anterior (A), and anterior combined with posterior (AP) techniques. Clearly defined and generally accepted parameters were scored and subsequently analyzed. The preoperative injury severity of the surgical groups was compared. The neurologic, radiologic, and functional outcome and complications of all groups were assessed.
Results: 
A total of 132 papers, the majority being retrospective case-series, were included representing 5,748 patients. The preoperative injury severity revealed an inequality between the subgroups. Partial neurologic deficits had the potential to resolve irrespective of treatment choice. None of the five techniques used was able to maintain the corrected kyphosis angle. The functional outcome after surgery seems to be better than generally believed. Complications are relatively rare.
Conclusions: 
In general, surgical treatment of traumatic spine fractures is safe and effective. Surgical techniques can only be compared using randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract={Background: 
The proper timing for surgical fracture repair is controversial. Early repair of long bone and cervical fractures reduces complications and is safe. Few studies exist to compare time to surgery with outcomes in thoracolumbar (TL) spine injuries.
Methods: 
Patients with TL spine injuries were identified from the trauma registry and divided into two cohorts on the basis of Injury Severity Score (ISS). Cohorts were compared for infectious, respiratory, and total complications in patients who had early (<72 hours from injury) versus late (>72 hours from injury) surgical repair. A retrospective chart review was performed on High ISS patients (> or =15) to identify differences in resuscitation needs and neurologic, respiratory, and infectious complications.
Results: 
Early surgery, Low ISS patients were younger, received fewer anterior repairs, and had shorter hospitalizations. Early patients in the High ISS cohort had significantly fewer total complications and shorter hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay. Resuscitative requirements were similar for both surgery groups. More late surgery patients required ventilator support for noninfectious reasons. There was no difference in admission or postoperative neurologic status or the incidence of head injury.
Conclusion: 
Early surgery in severely injured patients with thoracolumbar spine trauma was associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, required less ventilator support for noninfectious reasons, and did not increase neurologic deficits.},

  abstract={Background: 
In this article the authors investigated the consequences of misplaced thoracolumbar pedicle screws on late spinal stability.
Method: 
This study consisted of 16 patients with screws in the proper position (Group A) and a further 16 patients with screw misplacement (Group B) who had previously undergone transpedicular screw fixation following thoracolumbar injury. The authors retrospectively evaluated the bone fusion, anterior height of the fractured vertebrae and the kyphotic deformity on postoperative early neutral, and on postoperative long-term neutral and dynamic radiographs in both groups. The results and in addition a back pain questionnaire were compared within each group, and also between groups A and B.
Findings: 
The decreased anterior height of the fractured vertebrae and the increased degree of kyphosis on postoperative early radiographs in group B demonstrated that the correction of the deformity was inadequate in patients with screw misplacement. Furthermore, an additional increase in the degree of kyphosis on long-term neutral radiographs indicated a significant progression in late kyphotic deformity in group B, whereas it was not seen in group A. The evidence of significant motion on neutral-flexion and flexion-extension long-term radiographs demonstrated impaired stability in group B, whilst it was only evident in neutral-flexion radiographs in group A. Moreover, moderate to severe back pain was commonly reported by patients in group B and correlated with lack of bony fusion and significant motion.
Interpretation: 
The authors conclude that the screw misplacement decreased the original spinal stability provided by the instrumentation. Therefore, correct placement of pedicle screws is required to maintain long-term spinal stability.},

  abstract={The surgical management of post-traumatic thoracolumbar kyphosis remains controversial. The need for combined procedures is subject to debate, especially for post-traumatic kyphosis after simple type A fractures. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate radiographic findings, patient satisfaction and clinical outcome after mono-segmental surgical treatment using an anterior procedure alone (group 1, n = 10 patients) and using a one-stage combined anterior and posterior procedure (group 2, n = 15 patients) for post-traumatic thoracolumbar kyphosis after simple type A fractures. The main indication for surgery was pain. There were no statistically significant differences between the patients in the two groups concerning age, cause of injury, time interval between trauma and surgery, preoperative kyphosis and preoperative back pain score. For all these 25 patients, complete follow-up data were available for retrospective evaluation. The median follow-up was 17 years in group 1 and 8 years in group 2. Radiographic documentation and classification was made on the basis of standing antero-posterior and lateral views and computed tomographic scans. Fractures were categorized according to the Magerl classification. Kyphotic deformity was assessed on lateral radiographs using the Cobb method. Kyphosis angles were measured preoperatively, directly postoperatively, and at final follow-up. For clinical evaluation, the back pain scoring system of Greenough and Fraser was used. Patients were requested to score their status prior to trauma, preoperatively and at follow-up. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis ( P < 0.05 is significant). In all cases radiographic union was achieved. Median kyphosis in group 1 was corrected from 23 degrees preoperatively to 12 degrees postoperatively ( P < 0.01) and was 11 degrees at follow-up. Median kyphosis in group 2 was corrected from 21 degrees pre-operatively to 12 degrees postoperatively ( P < 0.01) and was 12 degrees at follow-up. The median back score in group 1 changed from 66 points before the trauma to 23 points ( P < 0.01) preoperatively and 35 points at follow-up ( P < 0.01). The median back score in group 2 changed from 67 points before the trauma to 20 points ( P < 0.01) preoperatively and 38 points at follow-up ( P < 0.01). In group 2, four patients had complaints due to annoying prominence of the dorsal instrumentation. In all these cases the dorsal instrumentation was removed. Statistical analysis in this series of ten patients with anterior spondylodesis compared with 15 patients with combined one-stage spondylodesis did not reveal objective advantages of the combined procedure as far as the outcome of radiographic correction of kyphosis or patient outcome is concerned. It is therefore concluded that in cases of post-traumatic thoracolumbar kyphosis after simple type A fractures, mono-segmental correction using an anterior procedure alone, with spondylodesis, is the surgical procedure of choice.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different types of Cotrel-Dubousset instrument systems in stabilising thoracolumbar and lumbar spine fractures.
Methods: 
Between January 1989 and December 1993, 45 fractures in 42 patients with unstable fracture or fracture dislocation of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spines were randomly assigned to 2 surgical treatments with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation-using either a long segment (Group 1) or a short segment (Group 2)-and short posterolateral fusion.
Results: 
Consolidation of the fractured vertebral body and posterolateral fusion were achieved at a mean time of 4.5 months; fusion rates were 75% in Group 1 and 83% in Group 2. The average collapses of anterior vertebral body height in Group 1, in the immediate postoperative period and at the final follow-up, were 15% and 17%, respectively; and in Group 2, the figures were 16% and 24%, respectively. The correction of vertebral height and kyphosis at the last follow-up were lost more in Group 2 (5.7 degrees ) than in Group 1 (4.4 degrees ). There were neurological recoveries in 6 of the 9 cases of incomplete paraplegics, including complete recovery in 5, and one-Frankel grade increase in one. There were 15 instrument failures in 12 patients, including screw breakage in 3 Group 1 cases and 6 Group 2 cases. The plug dislodged in 3 Group 1 cases, and the hook dislodged in 3 Group 2 cases. In other words, instrument failures were more common in Group 2.
Conclusion: 
Cotrel-Dubousset stabilisation of the fractured spine achieves fracture consolidation, but does not maintain the restored height and sagittal curve completely until fusion. The long rod and short fusion construct was more effective for all fracture types than was the short rod and fusion construct, although it leads to wider immobilisation of normal segments.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
The primary reduction and stabilization of all types of injury to the thoracolumbar spine is currently performed from the posterior approach by an internal, transpedicular fixator. The exceptions are type A fractures, according to the AO classification, that can primarily be treated from the anterior approach. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of BAS-O bioceramic granules, inserted by transpedicular approach, on the development of post-operative kyphosis of the segments injured.
Material: 
Between 1997 and 2001 we treated anterior spinal column fractures, using bioceramic granules in combination with an internal fixator, in 53 patients (40 men, 13 women: age 26 to 69 years; average, 42.3 years) at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the Third Faculty of Medicine and FNKV in Prague. However, only 42 patients (33 men, 9 women; age 28 to 67 years; average, 41.6 years) who had had the metal fixator removed more than six months previously were included in the study. The fixator was removed in the range of 10 to 24 months after the primary operation. The sample was divided into two groups; one with bioceramic material inserted in the body of the damaged vertebra (20 patients) and the other bioceramic granules implanted in both the vertebral body and the intervertebral space (22 patients).
Methods: 
In all the patients, the standard procedure included transpedicular application of Schanz's screws and an USS FS fixator (Synthes). If necessary, distraction of the segment injured and the correction of lordosis were carried out. Further transpedicular procedures to treat the anterior spinal column were as follows: If the vertebral body was injured without destruction to the intervertebral disc, a bent elevator was inserted through the vertebral foramen and the intervertebral joints were reduced. At the same time, a cavity for application of bioceramic granules was created. These were inserted, using a funnel and a pusher, in the anterior part of the injured body. If the fracture involved a destroyed intervertebral disc, the disc was removed, the vertebral end plate of the adjacent vertebra was perforated and bioceramic granules were inserted in both the vertebral body and intervertebral space. Subsequently, spongeous bone grafts were harvested from the ilium and massively applied to the previously decorticated transverse and articular processes.
Results: 
In the group of patients who had bioceramic granules inserted in only the vertebral body, the kyphotic angle was on average 10.36 degrees after injury and 2.86 degrees after surgery; therefore, a correction by 13.22 degrees was achieved. At 3 and 6 months after surgery, the kyphotic angle was 2.71 degrees and 2.68 degrees, respectively; at 3 and 6 months after fixator removal, it was 0.67 degree in both instances. In the group of patients with bioceramic granules implanted in both the vertebral body and intervertebral space, the kyphotic angle was on average 9.16 degrees after injury and 4.26 degrees after, surgery; therefore, a correction by 13.43 degrees was achieved. At 3 and 6 months after surgery, the kyphotic angle was -4.11 degrees and -4.00 degrees, respectively; at 3 and 6 months after fixator removal, it was 2.38 degrees and 2.44 degrees, respectively.
Discussion: 
Our results revealed differences between the patients who had bioceramic granules inserted in only the vertebral body and those who had them also in the intervertebral space. At 6 months after surgery, the first group showed the loss of correction per two segments to be 3.53 degrees on the average, whereas the second group had a loss of 6.70 degrees, i.e., twice as high. This may be explained by a more serious damage to the intervertebral disc in the latter group. Only small differences between the groups were found in the kyphotic angle at both 6 months after surgery and 3 to 6 months after fixator removal. This implied that, in both groups, the loss of correction occurred in the period up to 3 months after removal of the fixator.
Conclusions: 
Bioceramic granules provide material for replacement of osseous tissue in the body of the vertebra as well as conditions necessary for bone restructuring. The loss of correction per segment is lower by about half in patients treated with bioceramic granules than in those who received a spongeous bone grafts.},

Vertebral fracture caused solely by a convulsive seizure has rarely been reported in the neurosurgical literature.
Case description: 
We describe a 34-year-old male with severe back pain from a thoracic fracture occurring in association with a seizure during hospitalization for treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy. Bone mineral densities in the lumbar spine and the femoral neck were decreased, possibly by long-term anti-epileptic medication. Muscle contractions during a seizure can result in vertebral fractures, especially at the thoracic levels.
Conclusion: 
A complaint of back pain after a convulsive seizure should prompt radiologic investigation for vertebral fracture, even in the absence of external trauma.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Treatment of fractures and dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine is aimed at achieving a stable and painless spine. Concerning mode of treatment therapists are divided into two groups--those for conservative approach and those who advocate operative stabilization of spinal column. The objective of this paper was to compare radiological findings of both modes of treatment on the basis of our clinical material.
Materials and methods: 
The examination included radiographs of 96 patients with radiolographic signs of unstable spine, treated at Clinic of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Institute of Surgery of the Clinical Center in Novi Sad from 1984 to 1998. Among 48 operated patients (average age of 40.7), there were more females--25, and among nonoperated, there were more males--33. The average age of conservatively treated patients was 52. Dynamic radiographs evaluated the angle of local kyphosis on the spot of injury (Cobb's angle), reduction of dimensions of the body of injured vertebra and sagittal movement of the body on affected level. Measured values were corrected by values of sagittal index.
Results: 
Initially the average angle of local kyphosis among operated was 26.9, among conservatively treated it was 19.7. Control values for operated were 14.7 and for conservatively treated 25.6. Initially, a wedge-shaped deformity larger than half of the front part of the injured vertebra body had 42 nonoperated and 32 operated patients. Initially, the average sagittal movement of the injured vertebra body among operated patients was 6.97 mm, and at control 1.34 mm. Among nonoperated, the average movement of the body was 1.71 mm initially and 3.23 mm at control.
Discussion: 
Similar results of angular deformity were found by other examiners. Their results are also in favor of operative treatment of unstable injuries of Th-L spine. The number of those proclaiming good results of conservative treatment of injures of thoracolumbar spine in patients with initially high values of angular deformity is much less. Willen, Mumford, Andreycik and others using wedge-shaped deformity and sagittal movement of the body as parameters in their studies had similar results as those in this study, and they conclude that the stability of segment is much higher among operated patients and that operative treatment finally ends in better radiological results.
Conclusion: 
Radiological results of operative treatment of unstable injuries of thoracolumbar and lumbar spine are better than those of conservative treatment. In order to obtain a stable spine, which is the aim of treatment of unstable spine injuries, operative stabilization is necessary.},

  abstract={Short-segment posterior instrumentation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures has been reported with a high rate of failure. Transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in combination with short-segment instrumentation has been offered as an alternative to prevent failure. However, concern still remains about the potential complication of further canal narrowing or failure of remodeling with this technique. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the effect of transpedicular intracorporeal grafting on spinal canal restoration and remodeling in a group of patients treated with short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-one patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomised into transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n=11) and non-transpedicular grafting (NTPG) (n=10) groups, and were prospectively followed for an average of 50 months (range 25-85 months). Groups were similar in age, type of fracture, load sharing classification and kyphotic deformity. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomographic (CT) images through the level of pedicles were obtained, corrected for differences in magnification, and digitized. Areas of the spinal canals were measured and normalized by the estimated area at that level (average of adjacent levels). Average kyphosis was 19.7 degrees+/-6.2 degrees at presentation, was corrected to 1.9 degrees+/-4.9 degrees by operation, but was found to have deteriorated to 9.1 degrees+/-6.4 degrees at final follow-up. There were no differences between groups regarding the evolution of sagittal deformity. Spinal canal narrowing was 38.5+/-18.2% at presentation, 22.1+/-19.8% postoperatively, and it further improved to -2.5+/-16.7% at follow-up, similar for both groups. Our results demonstrate that transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in the treatment of burst fractures does not have a detectable effect on the rate of reconstruction of the canal area or on remodeling. Spinal canal remodeling was observed to occur in all patients regardless of grafting.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To assess the risk of infection in trauma patients undergoing surgical intervention with instrumentation for thoracic and lumbar fractures.
Data sources: 
A case series of 235 consecutive patients who sustained thoracic and lumbar fractures seen at Tampa General Hospital in Tampa, Florida between 1986 and 1997.
Study selection: 
117 patients of the 235 consecutive patients included in the case series underwent surgical intervention; of these patients, twelve were identified as having acute postoperative wound infections.
Data extraction: 
Of those patients treated with operative decompression and internal fixation, the authors identified and studied those with an acute wound infection. These patients were analyzed for risk factors and infection management.
Data synthesis: 
Twelve (10 percent) patients with acute postoperative wound infections were identified. These included nine deep and three superficial infections. This provides an overall infection rate of 10 percent (12 of 117). Of these, there were three infections in twenty-one patients undergoing anterior spinal procedures. Only two of the twelve patients had pure cultures of gram-positive organisms (2 Staphylococcus aureus). Cultures from eight (67 percent) patients showed multiple organisms. There was a significantly (P < 0.05) higher risk of infection in the patients with a complete neurologic injury 41 percent (7/17) as compared with those with no deficit or incomplete injuries 5.0 percent (5/100).
Conclusions: 
The overall risk of infection is higher in the trauma patient than in the elective surgery population. Those patients with a complete neurologic deficit are at a greater risk. Aggressive and early intervention can help contribute to a favorable outcome.},

Latest clinical and radiological follow-up was at 61/24 months. The clinical results were identical in both groups. Radiological measurements showed a significant loss of correction for all three measured angles (vertebral kyphosis, unisegmental kyphosis and bisegmental kyphosis) in both groups. However, patients with transpedicular bone grafting showed less loss of bony, vertebral kyphosis. Neither dorsolateral fusion nor dorsolateral fusion with transpedicular bone grafting could prevent loss of angular corrections.},

  abstract={Aim: 
To compare the anterior and posterior surgical approach in the emergency treatment of unstable burst thoracolumbar fracture.
Methods: 
Twenty-five patients with unstable thoracolumbar fracture underwent either anterior neurodecompression and fixation (n=13) or posterior reposition and semirigid fixation by hook-rod with pedicle screw fixation (n=12), depending on the type of implants available at the time of operation. Neurologically injured patients were operated on within the first 8 hours and neurologically intact patients within the first 2 days after the fracture. Neurological improvement was assessed according to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale and the Prolo economic/function outcome scale. We also recorded operation time, blood loss, cosmetic outcome, hospital stay and cost, complications, and donor site pain.
Results: 
There were no significant differences between the two groups in either neurological improvement (p=0.86) or favorable economic or function outcome (p=0.54 and p=0.53, respectively). The operation time was shorter in the posterior approach group than in the anterior approach group (median 174 min, range 130-215 vs median 250 min, range 200-295, respectively, p<0.001). The blood loss was smaller in the posterior approach group (median 750 mL, range 500-1,10, vs median 1,362 mL, range 1,150-1,50, in the anterior approach group; p<0.001). The posterior approach group also had better esthetic outcome, lower hospital cost, lower complication rate, and no donor site pain.
Conclusion: 
Both surgical techniques were equally effective in neurological improvement and functional outcome. Posterior surgery can be recommended in emergency neurodecompression and fixation of unstable thoracolumbar fractures because of the shorter operation time and smaller blood loss.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective, randomized study comparing two treatment methods for thoracolumbar burst fractures: short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting and the same procedure without transpedicular grafting.
Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of transpedicular grafting in preventing failure of short-segment fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Short-segment pedicle instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures is known to fail early because of the absence of anterior support. Additional transpedicular grafting has been offered as an alternative to prevent this failure. However, there is controversy about the results of transpedicular grafting.
Methods: 
Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in the study. The inclusion criterion was the presence of fractures through the T11-L3 vertebrae without neurologic compromise. The patients were randomized by a simple method into two groups. Group 1 patients were treated using short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n = 10), and Group 2 patients were treated by short-segment fixation alone (NTPG) (n = 10). Clinical (Likert's questionnaire) and radiologic (sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and local kyphosis) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in local kyphosis and/or screw breakage, was also not significantly different (TPG = 50%, NTPG = 40%, P = 0.99).
Conclusions: 
Short-segment transpedicular instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures is associated with a high rate of failure that cannot be decreased by additional transpedicular intracorporeal grafting.},

  abstract={The authors report on a prospective multicenter study with regard to the operative treatment of acute fractures and dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine (T10-L2). The study should analyze the operative methods currently used and determine the results in a large representative collective. This investigation was realized by the working group "spine" of the German Trauma Society. Between September 1994 and December 1996, 682 patients treated in 18 different traumatology centers in Germany and Austria were included. Part 2 describes the details of the operative methods and measured data in standard radiographs and CT scans of the spine. Of the patients, 448 (65.7%) were treated with posterior, 197 (28.9%) with combined posterior-anterior, and 37 (5.4%) with anterior surgery alone. In 72% of the posterior operations, the instrumentation was combined with transpedicular bone grafting. The combined procedures were performed as one-stage operations in 38.1%. A significantly longer average operative time (4:14 h) was noted in combined cases compared to the posterior (P < 0.001) or anterior (P < 0.05) procedures. The average blood loss was comparable in both posterior and anterior groups. During combined surgery the blood loss was significantly higher (P < 0.001; P < 0.05). The longest intraoperative fluoroscopy time (average 4:08 min) was noticed in posterior surgery with a significant difference compared to the anterior group. In almost every case a "Fixateur interne" (eight different types of internal fixators) was used for posterior stabilization. For anterior instrumentation, fixed angle implants (plate or rod systems) were mainly preferred (n = 22) compared to non-fixed angle plate systems (n = 12). A decompression of the spinal canal (indirect by reduction or direct by surgical means) was performed in 70.8% of the neurologically intact patients (Frankel/ASIA E) and in 82.6% of those with neurologic deficit (Frankel/ASIA grade A-D). An intraoperative myelography was added in 22% of all patients. The authors found a significant correlation between the amount of canal compromise in preoperative CT scans and the neurologic deficit in Frankel/ASIA grades. The wedge angle and sagittal index measured on lateral radiographs improved from -17.0 degrees and 0.63 (preoperative) to -6.3 degrees and 0.86 (postoperative). A significantly (P < 0.01) stronger deformity was noted preoperatively in the combined group compared to the posterior one. The segmental kyphosis angle improved by 11.3 degrees (8.8 degrees with inclusion of the two adjacent intervertebral disc spaces). A significantly better operative correction of the kyphotic deformity was found in the combined group. In 101 (14.8%) patients, intra- or postoperative complications were noticed, 41 (6.0%) required reoperation. There was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. Of the 2264 pedicle screws, 139 (6.1%) were found to be misplaced. This number included all screws, which were judged to be not placed in an optimal direction or location. In seven (1.0%) patients the false placement of screws was judged as a complication, four (0.6%) of them required revision. The multicenter study determines the actual incidence of thoracolumbar fractures and dislocations with associated injuries and describes the current standard of operative treatment. The efforts and prospects of different surgical methods could be demonstrated considering certain related risks. The follow-up of the population is still in progress and the late results remain for future publication.},

  abstract={A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98). Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively. According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program. All fractures in the conservative group were of type A. At follow-up of all operated cases, the local gibbus angle had improved by a reduction of on average 18.6 degrees and was followed by a loss of correction of 12.5 degrees ending in a final gain of 6.1 degrees at follow-up. At follow-up of the conservatively treated cases, the local gibbus angle showed an improvement of 11.1 degrees at reduction and a loss of correction of 14.9 degrees after reduction. The remaining result was -3.6 degrees, that means an increase of kyphoses compared to the x-ray at admission. In order to be able to compare two homogeneous groups only fractures of type A were used. Comparison of the two groups showed an improvement of the vertebral body angle of 70% (11.3 degrees) after reduction in the surgical group and 46% (6.1 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The subsequent loss of correction was 19% (3 degrees) in the surgical and 34% (4.5 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The remaining gain at follow-up was 51% (8.3 degrees) in the surgical and only 12% (1.6 degrees) in the conservative group. The local gibbus angle had improved on average by 17.1 degrees after reduction in the surgical and by 11.1 degrees in the conservatively treated group. Loss of correction was 71% (12.2 degrees) and 132% (14.9 degrees), respectively. The final result at follow-up showed a decrease of kyphosis of 4.9 degrees in the surgical and an increase of kyphosis of 3.7 degrees in the conservatively treated group. The difference was significant. Within the surgical group, 75% of the loss of correction was caused by the discs and 25% by the vertebral body. In the conservatively treated group it was 69% and 31%, respectively. Concerning loss of correction, no difference was seen between patients with and without intercorporal bone grafting. There was no relationship between radiological and clinical outcome. Whereas 15% of the patients of the surgical group were not satisfied or moderately satisfied with the result, all patients in the conservatively treated group were satisfied or very satisfied. Based on the good clinical results of the conservative treatment we can conclude that in stable fractures without severe deformity, and in patients who are in bad general condition, conservative treatment can considered as an alternative to surgical treatment.},

  abstract={The complications from the acute hospital stays of 235 patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures were reviewed and compared based on patients who underwent surgical stabilization and those treated with an aggressive nonoperative course of 6 weeks on a kinetic bed. Complications such as deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, and decubitus occur in patients with spine trauma. The perception is that surgical intervention decreases such complications and allows for earlier mobilization. The authors sought to determine the actual rate of occurrence and compare the groups for surgical and nonoperative complications. Two hundred thirty-five charts were reviewed. One hundred seventeen patients were treated with surgical stabilization, and 118 patients were treated with a nonoperative course of 6 weeks on a kinetic bed. Complications were assessed from the medical record. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of decubitus, deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, or mortality between the two groups. Deep wound infections occurred in 8% of the operative cases. The length of stay was 24 days longer in the nonoperative group. Both operative and nonoperative treatments of thoracolumbar fractures are viable alternatives. The complication rates are similar, with the exception of wound infection. The length of hospital stay is longer in the nonoperative group. The selection of treatment method remains a matter of controversy.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective, longitudinal study of multiply injured patients treated with segmental instrumentation for spinal fractures with a minimum 2-year follow-up.
Objectives: 
To determine whether urgent stabilization of spinal fractures in severely injured patients increases the risk of surgery compared with early treatment and historical results.
Summary and background data: 
Opinion in clinical studies is divided about whether operative treatment offers an advantage over nonoperative treatment in isolated spine fractures. Concomitant trauma is rarely discussed relative to decision making or surgical timing. Urgent stabilization of long-bone fractures improves survival and outcome in polytrauma patients. To date, urgent treatment of spine fractures in polytrauma patients has not been considered in the literature.
Methods: 
Seventy-five consecutive patients treated with segmental instrumentation for spinal trauma were observed prospectively to assess perioperative and longterm outcome. Twenty-seven patients with severe polytrauma (injury severity score, > 26) were separately analyzed. Perioperative and postoperative results were analyzed relative to timing of surgery, injury severity score, and surgical approach. Urgent treatment was defined as that provided within 24 hours of the spinal injury, and early treatment was defined as that provided between 24 and 72 hours after injury.
Results: 
Twenty-five patients (93%) sustained two or more major injuries in addition to the spine fracture, and 17 of 27 (63%) had neurologic injury. The mean injury severity score approached or exceeded the LD50 (50% expected mortality) in each group--36.0 for the early-treatment group and 42.0 for the urgent group--but only one patient in each group died. There were no deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, neurologic injuries, decubiti, deep wound infections, or episodes of sepsis in either group. Blood loss for anterior procedures was significantly higher in the urgent group, but estimated blood loss for posterior procedures was similar for both groups. At 49 months' mean follow-up, no revisions were necessitated by the urgent spinal treatment.
Conclusions: 
Urgent spinal stabilization is safe and appropriate in polytrauma patients when progressive neurologic deficit, thoracoabdominal trauma, or fracture instability increase the risks of delayed treatment.},

  abstract={Background: 
Both surgery and recumbency have been adopted in the treatment of spinal fractures. Herein we present the indications for each, and our experience with thoracolumbar junction (T12, L1 and L2) burst fractures.
Methods: 
Sixty-eight patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated operatively in 36 cases, and nonoperatively in 32 with recumbency for 1-6 weeks. Treatment was based on clinical and radiological criteria. Eighty-one percent of the recumbency patients, but only 14% of the surgical patients were intact on admission. Patients were followed for a mean+/-SD of 9+/-10 months in the recumbency group, and 21+/-21 months in the surgical group.
Results: 
Neurological improvement and progressive angular deformity occurred in both groups. The cost of recumbency in our patients was nearly half that of those who required surgery, though the length of hospitalization between the two groups was similar at 1 month +/-2 weeks.
Conclusion: 
The above study emphasizes that the selection of operative versus nonoperative treatment in burst fractures should not be random but based on clinical as well as radiological criteria. Recumbency is favored in patients who are intact, with angular deformity less than 20 degrees , a residual spinal canal greater than 50% of normal, and an anterior body height exceeding 50% of the posterior height. Surgical intervention is generally indicated in patients with partial neurological deficit, and those with severe instability.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A radiographic comparison of the mechanical efficacy of the Hartshill rectangle and that of the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems in the management of unstable burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Objectives: 
To study the restoration and maintenance of normal spinal anatomy after open reduction and internal fixation of unstable burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Summary of background data: 
There are laboratory studies documenting the biomechanical advantages of the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems. There have been no previous comparisons of the internal spinal skeletal fixation system with the Hartshill rectangle and sublaminar wiring in matched patient groups.
Methods: 
Radiographs obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at 2 years after surgery were used to assess the restoration and maintenance of normal spinal anatomy in 14 patients who had undergone stabilization with the Hartshill System and in 12 patients who had undergone internal fixation using the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation system.
Results: 
The initial restoration of normal spinal anatomy was good using both systems. However, on examination 2 years after surgery, it was found that the AO system provided significantly superior maintenance of both middle (P < 0.01) and anterior column anatomy (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
The AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems is associated with significantly superior maintenance of spinal anatomy 2 years after surgery.},

  abstract={Fifty-five patients who had sustained a burst fracture of the lumbar spine were followed for a mean of seventy-nine months (range, twenty-four to 192 months) after the injury. Thirty patients had been managed non-operatively with a short period of bed rest followed by protected mobilization. The remaining twenty-five patients had been managed operatively: eight, with posterior arthrodesis with long-segment hook-and-rod fixation; eight, with posterior arthrodesis with short-segment transpedicular fixation; six, with posterior arthrodesis and instrumentation followed by anterior decompression and arthrodesis; and three, with anterior decompression and arthrodesis. Thirty-six patients had been neurologically intact at the time of presentation and had remained so throughout the follow-up period. No neurological deterioration or symptoms of late spinal stenosis were seen. Isolated partial single-nerve-root deficits resolved regardless of the method of treatment. Patients who had had a complete single or a multiple-nerve-root paralysis seemed to have benefited from anterior decompression. Although the anatomical results as seen on the most recent radiographs were superior for the group that had been managed operatively with long posterior fixation or anterior and posterior arthrodesis, the most recent pain scores and the functional outcomes were similar for all treatment groups. At the latest follow-up evaluation, some loss of spinal alignment was noted in the patients who had been managed with short transpedicular fixation; the alignment at the most recent follow-up examination was comparable with that in the patients who had been managed non-operatively. For the patients who had had non-operative treatment, we were unable to predict the deformity at the time of follow-up on the basis of the initial diagnostic radiographs. The clinical outcome was not related to the deformity at the latest follow-up evaluation. On the basis of the results of our study, we recommend non-operative treatment for patients who do not have neurological dysfunction or who have an isolated partial nerve-root deficit at the time of presentation. For patients who have a multiple-nerve-root paralysis, anterior decompression is indicated.},

  abstract={Study design: 
This retrospective study analyzed the clinical and radiologic results of two groups of patients with unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine treated with anterior decompression, reduction of the kyphotic deformity, and stabilization by grafting and instrumentation.
Objective: 
To compare the results regarding loss of correction of two groups of patients treated with two different configurations of the same instrumentation, the so-called "Slot-Zielke" device.
Summary of background data: 
Decompression of burst fractures and reduction of kyphotic deformity are facilitated by the anterior approach to the spine. The maintenance of reduction depends on the strength of the grafting material and on the rigidity of the internal fixation.
Method: 
Forty consecutive patients with spine fractures underwent surgery for anterior decompression, reduction of kyphotic deformity, and stabilization by grafting and instrumentation. The first group of 25 patients (Group A) received a single rod "Slot-Zielke" device as an implant. The second group of 15 patients (Group B) received a double rod "Slot-Zielke" device. Before and at least 2 years after surgery, the kyphotic angle between the vertebrae above and below the fracture was measured.
Results: 
The clinical results at follow-up evaluation were similar between the groups. In Group A, 60% of the cases had a loss of correction of 5 degrees or more (least square mean, 5.64 degrees; range, 0-23 degrees). In Group B, the loss of correction in all cases was less than 5 degrees (least square mean, 1.60 degrees; range, 0-4 degrees). The difference between the average of both groups was highly significant (P = 0.014).
Conclusion: 
The double rod instrumentation performs significantly better regarding loss of correction compared with the single rod instrumentation.},

  abstract={The decision whether to treat amyelic thoracolumbar fractures conservatively or by surgical approach depends mainly on radiographic and clinical evaluation of their potential stability. An angle of kyphosis of 20 degrees or more evaluated using the sagittal index (s.i.) described by Farcy et al. in 1990, may be a valid indication for invasine treatment using pedicular systems for correction and stabilization; on the other hand, conservative treatment may be adequate for ensuring satisfactory results in fractures with an angle of less than 20 degrees, which are less likely to become unstable in clinically negative patients. This study confronts the immediate and long-term radiographic and clinical results in 2 groups of patients treated for amyelic thoracolumbar fractures, one treated conservatively, the other surgically; in particular, angle of kyphosis, vertebral compression and clinical conditions (pain and functional impairment) at long-term follow-up were assessed. The study was extended to include an assessment of outcome in relation to the angle of post-traumatic kyphosis in both operated and non-operated patients. Thirty-one patients with a diagnosis of non-neurological thoracolumbar trauma of the segment between D11 and L3 were studied. Twenty patients (group A) were treated conservatively (reduction on Cotrel bed and plaster vest) and 11 (group B) surgically (Diapason instrumentation). The 31 patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to the initial angle of kyphosis calculated using the s.i.: the first consisted of 16 patients (group C) with a s.i. of 20 degrees or more and the other of 15 patients (group D) with a s.i. less than 20 degrees. Six of the 16 group C patients and 5 of the 15 group D patients had been surgically treated. On the basis of the case-material considered, we found that satisfactory short-term radiographic results may be obtained by both conservative and surgical treatment. However, long-term outcome is less favorable in patients treated conservatively because maintainance of the initial improvement of the deformity in the injured segment is not as good as in those treated surgically. This limitation of conservative treatment does not however appear to negatively influence clinical conditions in patients with a s.i. of less than 20 degrees. In other words, although conservative treatment is not as effective as surgery for maintaining radiographic improvement, this does not necessarily signify clinical deterioration in cases with a s.i. of less than 20 degrees in whom the two types of treatment gave similar results.},

The follow-up was in average 5.7 years resp. 4.6 years. The operations were divided in monosegmental, floating and polysegmental fusions. In the total group, 10% of the non-instrumented and 28% of the instrumented patients had an osteoarthritis of the facet joints, 10% resp. 23% were unstable and in 9% resp. 1% a disc resorption occurred. There have been no statistical differences in the both polysegemental groups, but this was the case for all osteoarthritis and instabilities in the monosegmental fusions. It is supposed that the changes in kinematics together with material related alterations of elasticity led to higher stress concentration in case of instrumentation.},

The variables of timing and method of operative intervention, level and classification of fracture, associated injuries, injury severity score (ISS), associated neurologic deficits, length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and projected costs were analyzed for correlation with postoperative complications (pulmonary, skin, urinary, other). Four subgroups were identified: group IA patients underwent surgery within 72 h of injury and had an ISS of < 18; group IB patients underwent surgery after 72 h and had an ISS of < 18; group IIA patients underwent surgery within 72 h and had an ISS of > or = 18; and group IIB underwent surgery after 72 h and had an ISS of > or = 18. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of medical complications in patients comparing groups IA and IB. Group IIB patients had a statistically significant higher rate of morbidity than did group IIA. A separate group of patients with cervical spine injuries with neurologic deficit was analyzed by the same statistical analysis. Irrespective of associated injuries, all had fewer complications if they underwent surgery within 72 h. Morbidity was higher in patients with a neurological deficit compared with neurologically intact patients. Surgical decompression, reduction, and/or fixation of spinal fractures within the first 72 h is indicated in patients with multiple trauma (ISS > or = 18) and cervical injuries with a neurological deficit.},

  abstract={The efficacy of timing of surgery (short segment fixation using transpedicular screws), in burst fractures of thoracolumbar spine was evaluated between May 1993 and October 1994. The patients were divided into two groups according to time elapsed between injury and operation. Cases operated on within the first 24 h were taken as the early surgery group (n = 10) and cases operated on later than 24 h after the injury were considered as the late surgery group (n = 8). The efficacy of treatment was assessed by evaluation of the sagittal index (SI) restoration and reduction of canal compromise. The pre- and postoperative values for SI and canal narrowing (CN) for both groups are as follows: Early preoperative SI-23.40 degrees, late preoperative SI-24.50 degrees, p = 0.53; early preoperative CN-0.47, late preoperative CN 0.52, p = 0.33; early postoperative SI-4.20 degrees, late postoperative SI-13.50 degrees, p = 0.0001; early postoperative CN-0.10, late postoperative CN-0.39, p = 0.0000. There is still controversy concerning the relationship between canal narrowing and neurologic deficit, and the effect, if any, of decompression on neural recovery. Nevertheless, if the main aim of the surgical procedure is to restore the SI and decompress the neural canal, then other alternatives of decompression and realignment should be preferred to indirect reduction using short segment transpedicular fixation in cases to be operated on later than 24 h after injury.},

  abstract={Treatment of vertebral fractures by the fixed-angle system of the internal fixator allows fusion over a short area and is the form of treatment now in general use. A bisegmental construction is usual, which means that reduction and relief of the injured vertebral body is achieved indirectly by means of two intact vertebrae immediately adjacent on either side. As a result, both segments stiffen up or are permanently damaged in their function. We report on the possibility of single-segment fixation. The principle is the fusion of the injured segment itself only, i.e., the vertebra actually injured and the vertebra adjacent to the injured segment. Unnecessary fixation of a second healthy segment can thus be avoided. The characteristics of the fracture type in which single-segment stabilization is possible are explained. In a small study of the technique, we used the new AO classification of vertebral fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. The operation technique differs in some details from that applied with a multisegmental internal fixator. For example, the pedicle screws occasionally need to be inserted extremely close to the end-plates if the remaining part of the vertebral body has been destroyed and therefore cannot provide stability. Contraindications are broken pedicles and complete burst fractures of the body. With due consideration for these limitations fractures in all three main groups of the AO classification can, in principle, be stabilized in a single segment. In the years 1988-1990, 14 patients were operated on in this way (12 acute injuries, 2 secondary operations).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract={We assessed narrowing of the spinal canal in 39 burst fractures and fracture-dislocations of thoracolumbar vertebrae treated by the AO Internal Spinal Fixator, using CT preoperatively and at various stages postoperatively. Computer-aided planimetry was used to measure the narrowing, and its restoration shortly after instrumentation, or at 15 months. The mean initial reduction of canal area was to 63.7% +/- 18.8% of normal; this was restored to a mean of 95.4% +/- 21.2% of normal when measured either soon after surgery or at 15 months (p < 0.001 for both groups). There was more improvement in cases assessed later. For fractures from D12 to L3, the mean canal area was restored to 99.4% of normal; but at L4 or L5 the mean restitution was to only 60.9% (p < 0.05). We found no correlation between preoperative loss of area and amount of restoration, or severity of neurological deficit. Nor was there any correlation between the delay before surgery and the improvement achieved. The mechanism of fracture reduction appears to be a combination of distraction ligamentotaxis and forced hyperextension.},

  abstract={Fifty patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated by internal fixation using the Dick fixator. In the first 22 patients (group 1) this was accompanied by posterior intertransverse grafting. The technique was then modified in the following 28 patients (group 2) to include transpedicular elevation of the depressed vertebral end plate and grafting of the vertebral body, in an attempt to reduce the postoperative loss of correction of the kyphotic deformity. The clinical records and X-rays were reviewed to determine whether the change in technique had achieved this objective and whether it affected operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery and complications. The mean operating time and blood loss in group 1 were 2 h, 38 min and 650 ml, respectively, and in group 2 2 h, 59 min and 783 ml. These differences were not statistically significant. Time from operation to mobilisation and discharge from hospital were related to neurological deficit, but there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 in this regard. There was no difference in the complication rate between the two groups and no complication attributable to transpedicular bone grafting. The radiological results postoperatively and at a mean follow-up period of 9 months were assessed by measurement of the kyphosis angle, anterior vertebral height, anterior displacement, scoliosis, and reduction in cross-sectional area of the spinal canal. In group 1 the mean preoperative kyphosis angle and anterior vertebral height were 8 degrees and 21 mm; postoperatively these values were -12 degrees (lordosis) and 27 mm; and at follow-up they were -4 degrees and 24 mm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This factor must always be kept in mind during care of a trauma patient until a neurologic injury has been excluded, or the spine stabilized. The classification of spine injuries and evaluation of stability are based on clinical and radiological examinations of the patient. In grade 1 unstable injuries, deformity of the spine may increase if the injury is not stabilized. In grade 2 unstable injuries, a neural involvement may occur if the injury is not stabilized. All injuries with neural involvement are by definition unstable injuries grade 3. Stabilization is indicated for all unstable injuries. In unstable injuries grade 2 and 3, a well-developed method is transpedicular osteofixation with an internal fixator which allows reduction and neutralization of the deforming forces, combined with a transpedicular bone graft to the fractured vertebra. This provides stability and allows early mobilization without immobilizing more segments than involved in the unstable area.},

  abstract={Twenty-two low lumbar burst fractures (L3-L5) were treated, with an average follow up of 56.2 and 39.0 months in the conservative and surgically treated groups, respectively. Twenty patients were available for review; seven were treated conservatively and 13 were stabilized surgically. All patients were evaluated clinically for work status, activity level, residual pain, and subsequent development of neurologic symptoms. Roentgenograms were reviewed for severity of initial fracture, canal compromise, and maintenance of initial correction. In general, neurologically intact patients in both groups returned to similar postinjury employment levels. Persistent back pain was found to be more disabling in the surgically treated group, in which a fusion incorporating four or five lumbar segments was performed. There was no evidence of significant loss of initial reduction, and no patients experienced late neurological compromise in the surgical group. An average follow-up kyphosis of 9.2 degrees and 31% loss of vertebral height were observed in the conservative group, while a follow-up lordosis of 1 degree and 19% loss of vertebral height were observed in the surgical group. Conservative treatment of low lumbar burst fracture is a viable option in neurologically intact patients, but loss of lordosis and vertebral height may persist. Biomechanical and anatomic characteristics of the low lumbar spine differ from the thoracolumbar region and may account for the inherent stability of these injuries. If surgery is chosen, a long fusion with distraction instrumentation should be avoided in the low lumbar spine. A short rigid fixation with pedicular instrumentation may be of greater benefit.},

There were two treatment classes: 1) eight patients whose surgery included anterior bone grafting (augmentation), seven of which were done by the transpedicular approach; and 2) 13 patients whose surgery did not include anterior bone. Eight patients, seven of whom were in the second group, met at least one of the failure criteria. Life table calculations showed 100% implant survival through 22 months in the group treated with anterior bone augmentation, while the nonaugmented group showed 92% survival at 6 months, 68% survival at 9 months, 60% survival at 13 months, and 50% survival at 19 months. Statistical comparisons of the two groups resulted in P-values of 0.05 (Breslow) and 0.04 (Mantel-Cox). Based on this method of analysis, VSP instrumentation and two-level fusion is suitable surgical treatment for many burst fractures, but high failure rates may result if anterior bone augmentation is not performed.},

The first group consisted of 29 patients, treated between July 1983 and November 1986 with an one-stage operation consisting of anterior decompression by subtotal vertebrectomy, reduction and stabilization with the Slot-Zielke device. The mean follow-up was 3.1 years. The second group consisted of 33 patients, who were treated between November 1986 and November 1988. In this second group treatment was performed by an anterior decompression by subtotal vertebrectomy, reduction and stabilization with the Slot-Zielke-device, in the same session followed by an additional posterior spondylodesis and instrumentation with the Zielke D.K.S.-system or by the Cotrel-Dubousset compression-rod system. Mean follow-up of this second group was 1.7 years. In all patients bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients of the first group, but in only one patient (3%) of the second group. In both groups most patients with incomplete neurologic lesions improved postoperatively and were upgraded one or two steps on the Frankel-scale. No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In both groups a high percentage of patients were painfree at follow-up. The complication rate in both groups was low, despite the rather difficult anterior approach. Because of the high rate of loss of reduction in the first group of 29 patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaver spine, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
How to select operative methods for delayed paralysis after osteoporotic vertebral fracture remains a matter of debate. It is unclear which procedure provides better neurological and functional recovery. This study aimed to compare the various operative methods and investigate postoperative outcomes.
Methods: 
The study included 42 delayed paralysis patients (mean age 73.7 years). The operative methods were posterior spinal shortening osteotomy with direct decompression and short or long fusion and posterior laminectomy and short fusion with vertebroplasty. All patients in the vertebroplasty group were fitted with hooks to prevent correction loss. We investigated postoperative complications, surgery time, intraoperative blood loss, and changes in walking ability and local kyphotic angle (LKA). Patients were divided into three groups: shortening with a peripheral fusion range of one intervertebral level (the SS group, n = 18), the same procedure with a peripheral fusion range of ≥2 intervertebral levels (the SL group, n = 12), and posterior laminectomy and short fusion with vertebroplasty (the VP group, n = 12).
Results: 
Postoperative complications were observed in five patients, all of whom were in the SS and SL group. There were no significant differences between the SS and SL groups. The VP group experienced significantly shorter mean surgery times, significantly lower mean intraoperative blood loss, and an improvement in paralysis, walking ability, LKA, and correction loss. Overall, the VP group had significantly better outcomes.
Conclusion: 
Posterior laminectomy and short fusion with vertebroplasty with the addition of hooks is useful in cases of delayed paralysis in elderly patients.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Radiographic analysis, outcomes analysis (pain scale, Oswestry, SRS-24), and accumulation of complications. Outcomes and complications collected prospectively. Radiographic analysis performed retrospectively.
Objectives: 
To assess the benefits and stress complications of pedicle subtraction osteotomies for patients with fixed sagittal imbalance.
Summary of background data: 
Few reports on pedicle subtraction osteotomies exist in the peer-review literature for conditions other than trauma and ankylosing spondylitis.
Materials and methods: 
Thirty-three consecutive patients with sagittal imbalance treated with lumbar pedicle subtraction osteotomy at one institution (minimum 2-year follow-up) were analyzed. Complications were also analyzed for the entire group of consecutive pedicle subtraction osteotomies done at our institution to date (n = 66).
Results: 
For the 33 patients with minimum 2-year follow-up, there were significant improvements in the overall Oswestry score (P 0.0001) and pain score (P = 0.0001). Most patients reported improvement in pain and self-image and reported overall satisfaction based on ultimate SRS-24 questionnaire. There was one pseudarthrosis in the lumbar spine through an area of pedicle subtraction osteotomy (area of previous laminectomy and nonunion), and six patients had thoracic pseudarthroses (levels other than the osteotomy level) and one patient had a pseudarthrosis at L5-S1. Two patients had acute angular kyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction at the proximal end of the construct. Five patients who experienced transient neurologic deficits resolved their deficits after central canal enlargement.
Conclusions: 
The clinical result with pedicle subtraction osteotomy is reduced with pseudarthrosis in the thoracic or lumbar spine and subsequent breakdown adjacent to the fusion. For patients with a degenerative sagittal imbalance etiology the results were worse and the complications were higher. Central canal enlargement is critical.},

  abstract={Spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) frequently occurs as a result of long-term steroid administration for various disorders, and patients often present with osteoporosis. Acute paraplegia in patients with extensive thoracic SEL is rare. We report a case of acute paraplegia caused by osteoporotic compression fracture with extensive thoracic SEL in a 44-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis who had received steroid therapy for 4 years. He presented initially with abdominal distension and weakness of lower limbs, and a sudden onset of paraplegia with complete motor and sensory loss below the T6 level ensued. Plain radiographs showed an osteoporotic compression fracture of the T6 vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging showed osteoporotic compression fractures of the T5 and T6 vertebrae and SEL from T2 to T10 vertebrae. Decompressive laminectomy with epidural fat debulking was performed, and the pathology was confirmed as epidural lipomatosis. His neurological condition showed no improvement below the T6 level 3 months after surgery. Osteoporotic compression fracture is a risk factor for acute paraplegia in patients with thoracic SEL and decompressive surgery should be performed without delay.},

  abstract={Cushing's syndrome is frequently associated with osteoporosis. Therefore, the incidence of osteoporotic spine fractures is significant. They are a rare cause of paraplegic syndromes. Additionally, epidural lipomatosis may occur in those patients. The combination of both fracture and lipomatosis may cause neurological deficit. A case of a young patient suffering from drug-induced Cushing's syndrome is reported. She developed progressive paraplegia. Radiographs demonstrated kyphosis of the thoracic spine from T7 to T9 and pathologic fractures. Urgent operation was planned to stabilize and decompress the spinal cord in the area of the kyphosis. Fortunately, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted first. It confirmed pathologic fractures of T7-9 but also showed massive epidural fat extending from the level of T1 to T9. As suspected, laminectomy alone in the area of the fracture proved to be insufficient, as shown by myelography during operation. For treatment of paraplegia in this case of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis, an expanded laminectomy was necessary to remove all the epidural fat. Having undergone this procedure, the patient is now recovering from paraplegia. Our experience suggests that care should be taken before operative treatment of patients with pathological fractures in combination with Cushing's syndrome. In addition to vertebral fractures, epidural lipomatosis has to be taken into consideration. Those patients with neurological deficits have to be treated by an extensive laminectomy.},

  abstract={Study design: 
The impact of surgical stabilization on initial rehabilitation and complications in patients with traumatic thoracic level paraplegia was investigated. One hundred thirteen patient records were retrospectively reviewed.
Summary of background data: 
Forty-six patients had been treated with surgical stabilization and fusion. Nineteen patients had been treated by laminectomy alone. Forty-eight patients had been treated nonoperatively. The most common mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle accident (52.6%). The mean follow-up was 8.4 years.
Methods: 
All inpatient and outpatient records at Craig Hospital were reviewed for patients who had sustained a thoracic spine fracture (T2-T9) that resulted in complete paraplegia (Frankel A). All patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Data were collected regarding initial length of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as early and late complications that affected rehabilitation and function during follow-up. This information was analyzed by treatment group.
Results: 
There was a statistically significant difference in the length of initial rehabilitation days between the surgically stabilized group and the laminectomy-only group. There was a trend toward fewer in-patient rehabilitation days between the surgically stabilized group and the nonoperatively treated group. The surgically treated group had twice as many complications as the nonoperative group.
Conclusions: 
The surgical stabilization of thoracic (T2-T9) spine fractures with complete paraplegia tends to decrease initial rehabilitation days but is associated with increased overall complications. The treatment of this patient group clearly must be individualized.},

There are few ways of assessing how successful the repositioning is intraoperatively. Intraoperative ultrasound with a special small transducer is possible, but it is difficult to reach the intraspinal area by this means, because it is surrounded by bones. A laminectomy would destabilize the injured vertebral column even further. By experiments performed on six human vertebral columns we show that it is possible to view the entire length of the fractured posterior surface by ultrasound. The beam has to be projected between the laminae vertebrae following a small laminotomy. Preliminary intraoperative experiences with eight patients confirm our experimental results. The intraoperative ultrasound results have been confirmed by preoperative and postoperative CT. We expect the necessity for laminectomy for examination of the posterior surface of the vertebral body to decline in frequency in the near future.},

A retrospective clinical study.
Objective: 
To determine the imaging features that can be used to predict failure of reduction of a retropulsed fracture fragment by posterior ligamentotaxis in thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Posterior instrumentation and distraction with ligamentotaxis has been successfully used to shift retropulsed fragments anteriorly in thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, posterior longitudinal ligament rupture can lead to treatment failure. The exact preoperative radiographical parameters associated with failure of reduction remain unknown.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 85 patients who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fractures with significant retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal, as confirmed by preoperative computed tomography and followed by postoperative computed tomography, were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-three patients (85.9%) in whom the fragments were reduced by ligamentotaxis were included in the reduced group. In 12 patients (14.1%), the fracture fragment in the spinal canal was not reduced, and these patients were included in the nonreduced group. Neurologic status was classified according to the scoring system of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). The displaced distance and rotation angle of the fracture fragment were measured at the fractured segment.
Results: 
Preoperatively,the average displacement distances into the spinal canal of rotated posterosuperior fragments was 0.53 cm in the reduced group and 0.94 cm in the nonreduced group (P=0.002). The average rotation angles of the fracture fragments were 43.2 degrees in the reduced group and 61.7 degrees in the nonreduced group (P=0.012). "Double cortical surfaces" of the fragment were observed in the nonreduced patients. Neurological function was evaluated and recorded at the 2-year follow-up examination. There was no significant difference in the ASIA recovery grade between the 2 groups (P=0.668).
Conclusions: 
Displaced and rotated posterosuperior fracture fragments in thoracolumbar burst fracture cannot always be reduced by posterior ligamentotaxis. The 2 criteria for treatment failure that were most consistently present in our series were a displacement distance greater than 0.85 cm and a rotation angle greater than 55 degrees.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective analysis of 16 patients.
Summary of background data: 
The lumbar split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which is type C1.2.1 fracture in the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation spine fracture classification. The axial compressive and torsional force shattered the vertebral body into 2 halves and displaced them rotationally. This kind of fracture is so highly unstable that the treatment is very challenging.
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study was to report and compare on clinical outcome and complications of patients with lumbar split fracture-dislocation which had been treated either short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 16 patients with acute, split fracture-dislocation of the lumbar spine from March 2000 to May 2009 in our department were recruited. Seven patients (group I) treated by long-segment posterior fixation (2 levels above and 2 below the fracture) and anterior corpectomy and strut grafting. With the improvement of surgical technique and instrument, 9 patients after August 2004 were treated by short-segment posterior fixation (1 level above and 1 below, and included the fractured vertebrae itself) and anterior discectomy and strut grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, operation time, complications of operation, time to achieve bony fusion, Frankel scale, Oswestry Disability index, and Visual Analogue Pain Scale the Cobb angle were collected and compared.
Results: 
The mean follow-up was 33.4 months for group I and 36.2 months for group II. The operation time was 457.1 minutes in group I which was significantly longer than 240.0 minutes in group II. The total blood loss was for group I was 2001.4 mL (range, 1580-2500 mL) and for group II was 730.6 mL (range, 430-950 mL). There was no neurological deterioration after surgery in both group and no difference in neurological outcome between the 2 groups. The loss of correction in Cobb angle averaged at the final evaluation was 2 and 5 degrees for groups I and II, respectively. There was no radiologically visible pseudarthrosis. The postoperative Visual Analogue Pain Scale score was 3.3 and 2.7 for groups I and II, respectively. In the SF-36 survey, after surgery the domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in group B (P<0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). Time to achieve bony fusion in group I was 7.9 months which was significantly longer than 3.8 months in group II. Complications included 3 urinary infections, 1 decubitus ulcer, and 1 superficial infection that were cured by antibiotics. Screw breakage was found in 1 patient in the group II.
Conclusions: 
The lumbar sagittal split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which can be treated either with short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion. The short construct with pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae followed by the maneuver of rod derotation can obtain anatomic reduction, restoration of 3-column alignment, and decompress the affected neural elements by restoration of the normal canal dimension. It may be a better therapeutic option for the highly unstable lumbar fracture of C1.2.1.},

  abstract={Study design: 
We retrospectively reviewed 100 patients who were posterior stabilized without graft fusion. Using the Sextant system, 22 patients underwent minimally invasive short-segment 4-pedicle screw fixation (MIF4) and 39 patients underwent minimally invasive short-segment combined with intermediate screws fixation, that is, 6-pedicle screw fixation (MIF6). The conventional open posterior short-segment 4-pedicle screw fixation (OPF4) technique was used in 39 patients.
Objective: 
To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation using the Sextant system in the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures compared with the conventional open posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation technique.
Summary of background data: 
To the best of our knowledge, the clinical and radiographic outcomes of MIF4, MIF6 with polyaxial pedicle screws, and OPF4 with monoaxial pedicle screws have not been compared in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Visual analogue scores (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores, clinical outcomes including surgical blood loss, operation time, and postoperative hospital stay, sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral body angle, and anterior height of the fractured vertebrae were compared among the 3 groups.
Results: 
Significant postoperative improvements, relative to baseline, were observed in the VAS and ODI scores (P<0.05 each). There were no significant differences between the MIF4 and MIF6 groups in clinical outcomes, including surgical blood loss, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, VAS, and ODI scores (P>0.05 each). However, there were significant differences between both MIF groups and the OPF group (P<0.05 each). Significant improvements were observed in the sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral body angle, and anterior height of the fractured vertebrae (P<0.05 each). During follow-up, however, the correction loss of the sagittal Cobb angle was smallest in the MIF6 group (P<0.05).
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive posterior stabilization using the Sextant system resulted in reduced injury compared with the open surgery, during both the internal fixation surgery and the implant removal surgery. Percutaneous screw fixation through the pedicle of the fractured vertebra is superior to the conventional OPF4 technique in correcting kyphotic deformities, and can be performed without any extra procedures.},

Retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To examine perioperative characteristics among polytraumatized patients with operative, unstable spine fractures with and without concomitant operative long bone injuries.
Summary of background data: 
Treatment of polytrauma patients has delicate and time-sensitive protocols to ensure successful recovery. The literature defines standards for vertebral injury and surgical intervention.
Data: 
Severely polytraumatized patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)≥15 were divided according to those with operative spine fractures with operative long bone fractures (OSFLBF) and those with operative spine fractures alone (OSFA).
Methods: 
Patients were compared by sex, age, mechanism of injury (MOI), ISS, location of injuries, time spent inpatient before procedure(s), total time in the operating room, type of procedure(s) performed, estimated operative blood loss, complications, length of stay (LOS), and time to discharge.
Results: 
In a 12-year period, >600 patients were admitted to our level I trauma center with polytrauma and unstable spine fracture. Twelve had sustained operative unstable spine injuries and 21 had unstable spine injuries with a long bone injury requiring operative stabilization. Significant differences in ISS, LOS, MOI, region of vertebral injury, or total operating room time between the 2 groups were not observed. Differences were seen concerning average blood loss during surgery and time spent inpatient before entering the operating room. OSFLBF patients were discharged at a faster rate after 20 days compared with OSFSA patients.
Conclusions: 
No differences in ISS, LOS, MOI, region of vertebral injury or vertebral procedure, or total operating room time were observed. Blood loss was more substantial in the OSFLBF group, but it spent fewer days in the hospital preoperatively. Despite a nonstatistical difference in LOS, a larger proportion of OSFA patients remained in the hospital after being inpatient for >20 days, reducing the risk for iatrogenic complication in that group compared with OSFA.
Level of evidence: 
III, retrospective comparative.},

  abstract={Background: 
This study aimed to evaluate the application of 3D printing in assisting preoperative plan of pedicle screw placement for treating middle-upper thoracic trauma.
Methods: 
A preoperative plan was implemented in seven patients suffering from middle-upper thoracic (T3-T7) trauma between March 2013 and February 2016. In the 3D printing models, entry points of 56 pedicle screws (Magerl method) and 4 important parameters of the pedicle screws were measured, including optimal diameter (ϕ, mm), length (L, mm), inclined angle (α), head-tilting angle (+β), and tail-tilting angle (-β). In the surgery, bare-hands fixation of pedicle screws was performed using 3D printing models and the measured parameters as guidance.
Results: 
A total of seven patients were enrolled, including five men and two women, with the age of 21-62 years (mean age of 37.7 years). The position of the pedicle screw was evaluated postoperatively using a computerized tomography scan. Totally, 56 pedicle screws were placed, including 33 pieces of level 0, 18 pieces of level 1, 4 pieces of level 2 (pierced lateral wall), and 1 piece of level 3 (pierced lateral wall, no adverse consequences), with a fine rate of 91.0%.
Conclusions: 
3D printing technique is an intuitive and effective assistive technology to pedicle screw fixation for treating middle-upper thoracic vertebrae, which improve the accuracy of bare-hands screw placement and reduce empirical errors.
Trial registration: 
The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fujian Provincial Hospital. It was registered on March 1st, 2013, and the registration number was K2013-03-001.},

In vitro human cadaveric biomechanical study.
Objective: 
The aims of this project were to evaluate the acute segmental fixation and long-term screw stability afforded by 3 C2 fixation techniques: intralaminar, pars, and pedicle.
Summary of background data: 
C2 intralaminar screws offer the advantages of avoiding the vertebral artery; however, direct biomechanical comparison of this technique to the other methods of instrumenting C2 has not been performed.
Methods: 
Fourteen cadaveric specimens were dual energy radiograph absorptiometry scanned and segregated into 2 groups (n = 7/group) matching the C2 bone mineral density. All specimens were instrumented with C1 lateral mass and C2 intralaminar screws while measuring the insertional torque (IT). In group 1 C2 pars screws were inserted while in group 2 pedicle screws were placed. Nondestructive testing was performed in axial rotation, flexion/extension (FE), and lateral bending. The odontoid was then resected and loading repeated. Subsequently, specimens were disarticulated about C2 and individually loaded for 2000 cycles in the cephalocaudad plane. The screws were then failed by a tensile load directed in the parasagittal plane. Full range of motion over C1-C2 and peak screw pull-out force was quantified. RESULTS.: Transpedicular technique generated significantly higher IT than the pars screws and marginally greater IT than intralaminar screws. With the intact atlantoaxial ligamentous complex, intralaminar fixation was superior to pars and similar to pedicle instrumentation at limiting axial torsion. After odontoid destabilization, however, this technique was less effective at reducing the lateral bending range of motion. Destructive loading revealed the highest pull-out forces with the pedicle screws, followed by intralaminar and pars screws.
Conclusion: 
Our results suggest that C2 intralaminar fixation provides a viable alternative to pedicle screws and is superior to pars instrumentation in cases with preserved atlantoaxial ligamentous attachments. In the presence of a traumatic dens fracture, however, intralaminar fixation may not be the optimal choice.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective database review of all traumatic cervical spine injuries at a single tertiary care center.
Objective: 
To determine the acute survival of patients aged 65 and over with a variety of cervical spine injuries, regardless of operative or conservative treatment.
Summary of background data: 
Elderly patients with cervical spine injuries have historically suffered from high mortality rates. More recent literature has demonstrated improved outcomes among operatively treated elderly, but has suggested that the nonoperative treatment of cervical injuries in this population may itself contribute to increased mortality rates.
Methods: 
One thousand seventy-three consecutive patients were identified and initial hospitalization records reviewed. Ninety-four patients were excluded for incomplete data. The remaining 979 patients were divided by age into young and elderly groups. Sex distribution, mechanism, injury type, comorbidities, and mortality and complication rates were compared. Elderly patients were further divided into operative and nonoperative groups and acute outcomes were compared.
Results: 
The overall acute mortality rate for all patients with cervical spine injuries was 5.92%. Eighty-six percent of all patients 65 and over survived, as did 96.1% of younger patients. Seventy-three percent of elderly patients with complete injuries survived, as did 80% of those with incomplete injuries, and 95.6% of intact elderly. Acute mortality rates were statistically comparable in both the operatively and nonoperatively treated groups of elderly.
Conclusions: 
In this large comprehensive series of elderly patients with cervical spine injuries, statistically comparable survival rates were achieved in both operatively treated and nonoperatively treated patient populations. This finding challenges the conclusion that the nonoperative treatment of the elderly necessarily results in increased acute mortality.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Acute respiratory compromise is occasionally observed in a subgroup of patients with upper spinal injuries involving the C2 vertebrae. A retrospective review was performed to identify fracture types and risk factors for early respiratory deterioration following injury to the upper cervical spine.
Objectives: 
To examine the frequency of respiratory complications encountered following traction manipulation of specific upper cervical spinal injuries involving the C2 vertebrae.
Summary of background data: 
Major complications related to cervical skeletal traction are uncommon. Respiratory compromise with occasional mortality has been observed. Risk factors for acute respiratory failure are unknown.
Methods: 
The medical records of 166 consecutive patients with fractures of the C2 vertebrae admitted between January 1994 and July 1998 to a regional spinal cord injury center were examined. Demographic data, injury subtype, fracture displacement, respiratory status, treatment method, and outcome at discharge were examined. Patients with comorbidities compromising respiratory function were excluded.
Results: 
One hundred fifty-five patients met the inclusion criteria of this study. Sixty-one patients had Type II odontoid fractures of which 53 were displaced (32 posteriorly and 21 anteriorly). In addition, there were 21 patients with Type III odontoid fractures, 33 with axis C2 body fractures, 32 with Hangman's fractures, and eight patients with an os odontoideum. Thirteen of 32 patients with posteriorly displaced odontoid fractures experienced acute respiratory compromise following reduction with cervical skeletal traction and immobilization, while only three of the remaining 123 patients had respiratory difficulties. Respiratory distress as a consequence of cervical spine fractures resulted in three deaths. Two of these patients had posteriorly displaced Type II odontoid fractures whose airway could not be emergently intubated.
Conclusion: 
Frequent respiratory deterioration (40% of patients) during acute management of posteriorly displaced Type II odontoid fractures after reduction was observed. Physicians must be aware that cervical flexion in the treatment of posteriorly displaced odontoid fractures may significantly increase the risk of airway obstruction due to the presence of acute retropharyngeal swelling. This may be avoided with elective nasotracheal intubation in this upper cervical spine fracture subtype.},

We discuss literature relevant to this case with an emphasis on identifying warning signs, including recurrent pin loosening, especially in patients with compromised bone structure and high risk of bleeding. Our 61-year-old patient presented to neurosurgery clinic for a 2-month follow-up of a type-III odontoid fracture sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The patient had repeatedly loosened halo pins, and shortly after the pins were tightened, the patient had a syncopal event and struck her head. An emergent computed tomography scan revealed acute SDH requiring emergent craniotomy and evacuation. SDH following pin penetration in a patient with bilateral vertebral artery dissection, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation has not been reported as a complication of the use of the halo vest for stabilization of the cervical spine. The risk of this serious complication can be minimized by giving special consideration to patients with comorbidities and by repositioning problematic pins. This case demonstrates the importance of special attention to bone strength, bleeding risk, and recurrent minor complaints with use of the halo vest.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty on respiratory function in patients with compression fractures caused by osteoporosis.
Subjects and methods: 
Ninety-eight patients (87 women, 11 men; mean age, 74 years; age range, 60-90 years) with compression fractures of 75 thoracic (Th7-Th12) and 89 lumbar (L1-L5) vertebrae were enrolled in this study. Percentage vital capacity (VC%), percentage forced vital capacity (FVC%), and percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) were measured using a spirometer before, 1 day after, and 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate whether any significant differences in VC%, FVC%, or %FEV1 values existed between before, 1 day after, and 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Results: 
The VC% and FVC% values had improved significantly by 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty compared with before percutaneous vertebroplasty (p<0.01). No significant difference was noted between values before and 1 day after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Likewise, no significant difference was identified in %FEV1 before percutaneous vertebroplasty and either 1 day or 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The mean degree of improvement in VC% values after percutaneous vertebroplasty for patients with one vertebra treated, which we refer to as the "single-vertebroplasty" group, and for patients with two or more vertebrae treated, or "multiple-vertebroplasty" group, was 1.1%±7% (SD) and 6.3%±8%, respectively, representing a significant difference between groups (p=0.01). The mean VC% values before and 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty differed significantly (p=0.02) in the thoracic group and overlapping group.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty improves restrictive ventilatory impairment, but this improvement requires approximately 1 month to occur. Greater improvement in restrictive ventilatory dysfunction was observed in patients who underwent multiple vertebroplasty procedures than those who underwent a single procedure and in patients who underwent treatment of thoracic vertebrae than those who underwent treatment of other vertebrae.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral augmentation is an effective and minimally invasive procedure that is used extensively worldwide for the treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). New pain from adjacent vertebra fracture (AVF) after initial cement augmentation has gradually been given attention, but the exact causes of AVF are still controversial. The purpose of this study was to analyze the associated incidence, risk factors, and possible causative mechanism of symptomatic AVF, and to evaluate the intrinsic relationship between cement leakage into the disk and AVF.
Methods: 
Three hundred and fifty-eight patients (271 women, 87 men; mean age 70.5 ± 9.1 years; range 42-91 years) undergoing vertebral augmentation for their single level of OVCFs were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into AVF (n = 26) and AVF-free (n = 332) groups, and the groups were compared with respect to preoperative and perioperative parameters, as well as postoperative results. Potential risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.
Results: 
The rate of symptomatic AVF was 7.3%. The majority of symptomatic AVF, 57.7% of which developed 6 months after the procedures, were located mainly in the thoraco-lumbar vertebra. Significant differences were found between the AVF and AVF-free groups with regard to age, bone mineral density (BMD), and intravertebral clefts (p < 0.05). AVF occurred in six of 28 patients with intravertebral clefts, and five of them developed AVF within 6 months after the procedure. No statistically significant association was observed in the correlation between intradiscal cement leakage and the incidence of symptomatic AVF (p = 0.390).
Conclusions: 
Older age, lower BMD, and intravertebral clefts are the main risk factors for symptomatic AVF after vertebral augmentation, but intradiscal cement leakage does not increase the risk of AVF. AVF occurs because of the natural progression of osteoporosis. Even distribution of bone cement in the vertebral body is important in OVCF patients with intravertebral clefts.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective cohort study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to compare the anterior odontoid screw fixation (AOSF) with a guide tube or with a straight probe.
Summary of background data: 
AOSF associates with several complications, including malpositioning, fixation loss, and screw breakage. Screw pull-out from the C2 body is the most common complication.
Methods: 
All consecutive patients with type II or rostral shallow type III odontoid fractures who underwent AOSFs during the study period were enrolled retrospectively. The guide-tube AOSF method followed the standard published method except C3 body and C2-3 disc annulus rimming was omitted to prevent disc injury; instead, the guide tube was anchored at the anterior inferior C2 vertebra corner. After 2 screw pull-outs, the guide-tube cohort was analyzed to identify the cause of instrument failure. Thereafter, the straight-probe method was developed. A guide tube was not used. A small pilot hole was made on the most anterior side of the inferior endplate, followed by insertion of a 2.5 mm straight probe through the C2 body. Non-union and instrument failure rates and screw-direction angles of the guide-tube and straight-probe groups were recorded.
Results: 
The guide-tube group (n = 13) had 2 screw pull-outs and 1 non-union. The straight-probe group (n = 8) had no complications and significantly larger screw-direction angles than the guide-tube group (60.5 ± 4.63 vs. 54.8 ± 3.82 degrees; P = 0.047).
Conclusion: 
Straight-probe AOSF yielded larger direction angles without injuring bone and disc. Complications were absent. The procedure was easier than guide-tube AOSF and assured sufficient engagement, even in horizontal fracture orientation cases.
Level of evidence: 
3.},

  abstract={As a rule vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can prevent further collapse of a previously broken vertebra. Pain is probably caused by collapse of the porous bone resulting in instability of the vertebra. Stabilization of the vertebra by injecting cement results in a clear improvement in the complaint and a clear reduction in pain resulting in better mobilization. Recent results have, however, cast doubt on the effectiveness of this therapy. Diagnostic nerve blocks on the spinal column are important because the pain is mostly clinically uncharacteristic, the innervation is complex and the pain is subjective. An exact classification can be made using special nerve blocks. Prerequisites for the use of diagnostic nerve blocks are an extensive clinical history and examination of the patient before nerve blocks are carried out. In approximately 15-45% of patients the zygapophyseal joint is the cause of the back pain. Anesthesia of the zygapophyseal joint can be carried out by direct intra-articular application of a local anesthetic or by a block of the medial branch of the posterior branch of each of two spinal nerves. The simplest method is by computed tomography-guided zygapophyseal block.},

To explore the clinical outcomes of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
Methods: 
From January 2007 to February 2010, the data of 40 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture underwent treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Of them,20 patients were treated with PVP (PVP group), there were 8 males and 12 females with an average age of (66.37 +/- 2.34) years old (54 to 81); 20 patients were treated with PKP (PKP group), there were 11 males and 9 females with an average of (65.12 +/- 3.21) years old (56 to 79). Postoperative at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year, pain and daily life function were respectively assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and Barthel index (BI); and anterior height of responsibility vertebra, Cobb angle were measured by X-rays.
Results: 
In PVP group, 1 case complicated with bone cement leakage without clinical symptoms and no operation to treat. No postoperative infection and deep vein thrombosis were found between two groups. All patients were followed up more than 1 year, pain and daily life function has obviously improved than preoperative (P < 0.01); and there was no significant difference on 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year after operation (P > 0.05); there was no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). In PVP group, there was no significant difference in anterior height of responsibility vertebra, Cobb angle before and after operation;and in PKP group, postoperative data has obviously improved than preoperative (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference postoperative at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year (P > 0.05); there was no significant difference between two groups at 1 week, 12 weeks, 1 year after operation.
Conclusion: 
Both the methods can obviously relieve pain and completely or partly recover daily life function in treating OVCF. But PKP has advantages of recovery of anterior height of responsibility vertebra and correction of Cobb angle, especially for serious compression.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the characteristics of recurrent fracture of a new vertebral body after percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporosis.
Methods: 
29 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients were divided into two groups: 14 patients with recurrent fracture of a new vertebral body after vertebroplasty comprised the new fracture group and there were 15 patients without recurrent fracture in the control group. The following variables were reviewed: age, body mass index (BMI), history of fractures, history of metabolic disease, anti-osteoporosis therapy, type of back brace used, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium and phosphorus, and time since vertebroplasty.
Results: 
Compared with the control group, patients in the new fracture group were statistically significantly different with respect to BMI (t = 2.538, P = 0.027), BMD of the lumbar spine (t = 2.761, P = 0.015), BMD of the hip (t = 2.367, P = 0.037) and iPTH (t = 2.711, P = 0.017). Twelve (86%) of the 14 patients' new vertebral fractures occurred within six months after treatment of the initial fracture, and 10 (71%) fractures were adjacent to those previously treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Conclusions: 
A substantial number of patients with osteoporosis develop new fractures after vertebroplasty; two-thirds of these new fractures occur in vertebrae adjacent to those previously treated. The following variables influence the outcome: BMI, history of fractures, history of metabolic diseases and medications, BMD of lumbar spine and hip, anti-osteoporosis therapy, and use of back brace.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The aim of this article was to analyze risk factors for secondary new vertebral compression fractures (SNVCFs) after percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporosis.
Methods: 
We investigated medical records and radiologic images of patients undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture between October 2009 and September 2014. We assessed patients' age, past medical history, and bone mineral content using computed tomography. Procedure-specific outcomes were assessed, including ratio of injected bone cement to vertebral body volume, bone cement distribution in the vertebral body (to identify degree of consistency in bone cement injection), presence of bone cement leakage into adjacent disc space, segmental kyphosis, and time interval between first and second fracture events.
Results: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in 293 patients (60 men and 233 women) with 336 affected levels. Of this cohort, 34 (14.6%) patients sustained SNVCFs. We compared patients in 2 groups: patients who experienced SNVCFs, and patients who did not experience fractures. Significant differences were identified in bone mineral content (P = 0.000) and bone cement distribution (P = 0.000). Patients exhibiting bone cement leakage into disc space revealed a higher incidence of SNVCF than patients without leakage (P = 0.039).
Conclusions: 
Poor bone mineral content can be a predictive factor of SNVCFs. To prevent SNVCFs, bone cement should be injected as evenly as possible into the vertebral body. Bone cement leakage into the disc space should be avoided.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To explore the reasons of secondary fracture after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) and discuss the measure of prevention and cure.
Methods: 
From January 2011 to January 2013, the clinical data of 180 patients with primary OVCFs treated by PVP were retrospectively analyzed. There were 75 males and 105 females, aged from 68 to 95 years old with an average of (79.50 ± 5.45) years. The involved vertebrae were identified according to the clinical symptoms and imaging data. PVP were performed in 362 vertebrae and the patients were followed up with an average of 12 months. Subsequent vertebral fractures were found through the pain's reappearance and MRI or bone scan. The patients were divided into secondary fracture group and no-secondary fracture group according to the subsequent fractures or no. Secondary fracture group was divided into two groups according to gender, and the patients with secondary fracture were also categorized into the original surgical vertebral fractures, adjacent vertebral fracture and remote vertebral fractures. The age, gender, the cement volume, the cement leakage, secondary fracture site, the incidence and type of secondary fracture were observed and compared among different groups.
Results: 
Among the 362 vertebrae of PVP, there were 109 vertebrae in male and 253 vertebrae in female. And 27 vertebrae (10 in male and 17 in female) of 22 cases (9 males and 13 females) occurred secondary fracture. The second PVP were performed in 13 cases (16 vertebrae) and the third PVP in 2 cases (4 vertebrae); 7 cases (7 vertebrae) were treated with conservative therapy. There was no statistically significant difference on age, gender, cement volume and leakage between secondary fracture group and no-secondary fracture group (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference on the incidence and type of secondary fracture between male and female (P > 0.05). No significant difference was found on the adjacent and remote vertebral fractures (P > 0.05). Most of secondary fracture occurred in 6 months, and whether the single and double side injection, cement leakage had no obvious relation.
Conclusion: 
There is no significant difference in the subsequent fracture after PVP for the OVCFs different gender and fractured site, and also no significant difference in the adjacent and remote vertebral fractures. The report didn't support the biomechanical viewpoint that vertebral body stiffness increasing after PVP would lead to adjacent vertebral stress increasing and result easily in adjacent vertebral fracture. Secondary fracture occurs always in 6 months after operation, which is the natural course of osteoporosis.},

  abstract={Study design: 
This was a retrospective study.
Objective: 
To compare the efficacy and safety between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and posterior fixation and fusion (PFF) for treating unstable hangman's fracture.
Summary of background data: 
In previous clinical study, ACDF and PFF have been introduced to manage unstable hangman's fracture. However, it remains unknown which approach is superior.
Methods: 
Between January 2006 and May 2011, 44 patients with unstable hangman's fracture underwent either ACDF or PFF. The operation time, blood loss, surgical complications, and postoperative drainage were compared. Neurologic function was evaluated using the ASIA scale and neck pain was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. Rates of fracture heeling and bone fusion were also studied.
Results: 
Follow-up was completed for 38 patients. Twenty-four cases underwent ACDF and 14 cases received PFF. The operation was successful in all 38 cases. The mean operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative drainage were significantly shorter or less for the ACDF group than the PFF group (P<0.01). No surgical complication was reported in the ACDF group. Excessive bleeding due to injury to the venous plexus occurred in 3 cases in the PFF group. The VAS score in the 2 groups was significantly lower than their respective preoperative score (P<0.01), but there was no difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Solid fusion was achieved with no implant failure in all cases 6 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, 8 cases with ASIA C or D grade improved to E grade.
Conclusions: 
The anterior procedure seems to be superior to the posterior approach for unstable hangman's fracture as it is a less invasive and simpler procedure with fewer complications and is especially indicated for cases with no medullary canal in C2 pedicles and traumatic C2-3 disk herniation compressing the spinal cord.},

  abstract={Background context: 
With the increase of the elderly population, osteoporotic vertebral fractures have been frequently reported. Surgical intervention is usually recommended in osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits. However, very few reports on surgical interventions exist.
Purpose: 
To compare surgical results of anterior and posterior procedures for treating osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with sustained neurologic deficits.
Study design: 
Retrospective comparative study.
Patient sample: 
Fifty patients who sustained osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits were treated either by anterior decompression and strut graft (n=32) or by posterior decompression and pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty (n=18).
Outcome measures: 
Incidence of complications, sagittal Cobb angle, spinal canal encroachment, and Japanese Orthopedic Association score.
Methods: 
The authors retrospectively reviewed the results of a consecutive series of patients undergoing anterior decompression and strut graft or posterior decompression and pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty for osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits. Operative notes, clinical charts, and radiographs were analyzed.
Results: 
Operative time was similar between the groups, but intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the posterior group. All patients showed neurologic recovery. No significant difference was observed in the neurologic improvement, kyphosis correction angle, and loss of correction. Perioperative respiratory complications were found in 11 patients (34%) in the anterior group. In the anterior group, early posterior reinforcement was required in patients with very low bone density below 0.60 g/cm(2) and/or in those with three segments of instrumentation for two vertebral collapses. Posterior group patients did not undergo additional surgery.
Conclusions: 
Anterior reconstruction for osteoporotic vertebral collapse is significant because anterior elements, particularly those at the thoracolumbar junction, play a major role in load bearing. However, difficulties arise when anterior reconstruction is performed in cases with very low bone density and in those with multiple vertebral collapse.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective, comparative study.
Summary of background data and objectives: 
Anterior screw fixation has become an accomplished treatment option for the management of odontoid fractures. In younger patients, it has shown encouraging results with low complication rates; whereas in geriatric trauma victims, it remains the subject of controversy. The purpose of this study was to determine functional and radiographic results after anterior screw fixation of Type II odontoid fractures, with the particular interest to compare the outcome between younger and elderly patients.
Material::Methods: 
We reviewed clinical and radiographic records of 110 patients with an average age of 54 years at the time of surgery after anterior double screw fixation of their odontoid fractures between 1990 and 2004. To compare functional and radiographic results between nongeriatric and geriatric patients, they were divided by age into 2 groups: Group A included patients 65 years of age or younger and Group B contained patients older than 65 years.
Results: 
A total of 95 patients had returned to their preinjury activity level and were satisfied with their treatment. The Smiley-Webster scale showed an overall outcome score of 1.42 with similar results in both groups (Group A, 1.34; Group B, 1.50). Bony fusion was achieved in 102 patients, failures of reduction or fixation occurred in 12 patients. Comparing between the 2 groups, we had a nonunion rate of 4% in younger individuals and a significantly higher rate of 12% in geriatric patients. Reoperation due to nonunion or technical failures was necessary in 8 patients.
Conclusion: 
We had encouraging results using anterior screw fixation for surgical treatment of odontoid fractures and favor this method as preferred management strategy for stabilization of these fractures. Comparing between age groups, we had similar results on cervical spine function. With regards to fracture healing as well as morbidity and mortality, younger patients had a superior outcome.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The purpose of this study was to assess the value of isocentric C-arm three-dimensional (Iso-C 3D) fluoroscopy for the insertion of an anterior odontoid screw. The results of the Iso-C 3D group were compared with that of an historic control group using conventional fluoroscopy.
Methods: 
Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with type II or rostral-type III odontoid fractures were treated with a single anterior screw fixation in this study. The Iso-C 3D group included 13 patients and the other 16 patients were in the historic control group. All operations were performed by a single surgeon using standard procedure and manner. The clinical and radiographic results were recorded and compared between the two groups.
Results: 
The fluoroscopy time in the Iso-C 3D group was 42.9 s as compared to 68.1 s in the control group (P < 0.01). The mean operative time was 91.5 min in the Iso-C 3D group when compared with 81.6 min in the control group (P = 0.20). The rate of bony fusion was 96.6% (28/29), the failure rate of reduction or fixation was 13.8% (7.7% in Iso-C 3D group; 18.8% in control group). The Smiley-Webster scale showed that 90% of patients achieved good or better outcomes
Conclusions: 
In conclusion, this technique can be safely extended to the treatment of technically difficult to treat spinal injuries and at the same time reduce total radiation exposure time both for the patient and the surgeon.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort analysis.
Objective: 
To compare 30-day perioperative clinical outcomes of surgical odontoid stabilization by an anterior or posterior operative approach in elderly patients.
Summary of background data: 
Surgical stabilization of odontoid fractures is superior to nonoperative management in geriatric patients. How elderly patients with odontoid fractures fare after anterior and posterior approaches, however, is not well defined.
Materials and methods: 
Retrospective review of the prospectively collected American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2005-2013). Elderly patients (≥65 y) with odontoid fractures who underwent odontoid stabilization through anterior or posterior approaches were identified by International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision/Common Procedure Terminology codes. Exclusion criteria included concomitant subaxial spine surgery, instrumentation noncontiguous with the atlantoaxial interval, and combined approaches. Baseline demographics and perioperative details were compared. Adverse events, mortality, reoperation, discharge, and readmission rates within 30 days of operation were compared using bivariate and multivariate generalized linear regressions.
Results: 
One hundred forty-one patients (male-81; female-60; average age: 77.8±6.5 y; anterior approach-48; posterior approach-93) were analyzed. Patients scheduled to have a posterior approach had significantly more nonunions preoperatively and higher body mass indices. Operative times for posterior surgeries were significantly longer. Age, comorbidities, functional dependence, time to surgery, and length of hospital stay were similar between groups. There were no significant differences in the relative risk (RR) of the composite outcome of "any adverse event" after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics. Patients who underwent an anterior approach were more likely to have an unplanned hospital readmission (RR=8.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.21-36.29; P=0.002) and have significantly more revision operations (RR=19.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.49-152.62; P=0.005) than patients who had a posterior operation.
Conclusions: 
An anterior approach for odontoid fracture stabilization in patients ≥65 years old were associated with shorter operative times and greater RRs of unplanned readmissions and revision operations within 30 days of surgery relative to a posterior approach.},

  abstract={Despite the increasing number of reports on surgical treatments for thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficits, the choice of surgery remains controversial. In this retrospective study, we compared the outcomes of posterior and anterior surgeries for single-level osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficit in the thoracolumbar spine. Both posterior and anterior surgical approaches were performed with a consistent procedure for a single surgical indication at one institution. Twenty-four patients treated with posterior surgery and 28 patients treated with anterior surgery were followed-up over an average of 5 years after surgery. Radiographic results (kyphotic angle, bony fusion, and instrumentation failure), neurological improvement, and surgical complications were compared between the two groups. The average correction angle after surgery was larger in the posterior group than in the anterior group (P = 0.013), but not at final follow-up (P = 0.755). The average loss of correction was also higher in the posterior group than in the anterior group (P = 0.037). There was no significant difference in neurological outcomes between anterior and posterior approaches (P = 0.080). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the neurological outcome was better in wedge type than in flat type vertebral collapse, regardless of the type of surgical approach (P = 0.0093). In wedge type vertebral collapse, neurological improvement tended to be greater after anterior than after posterior surgery. In four of six cases with instrumentation failure in the anterior group, a titanium cage subsided more than 5 mm but bony fusion was eventually achieved without causing neurological problems. In the posterior group, six cases experienced instrumentation failure during the postoperative course (two cases with screws loosened from pedicles and bodies, and one case with breakage of a screw neck). None of the patients developed instrumentation-related neurological problems. Two cases in each group developed pseudoarthrosis. In single-level osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficit, anterior surgery tended to improve neurological deficit in wedge type, but not in flat type collapse, compared with posterior surgery.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is widely used for the treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). However, new VCFs occur frequently after PVP.
Objectives: 
We aim to establish an objective risk score system to assess the possibility of new vertebral fractures in patients with VCFs undergoing PVP.
Study design: 
This study was a retrospective study, and it was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our 2 institutions.
Setting: 
This study consists of patients from 2 large academic centers.
Methods: 
Patients with VCFs who underwent their first PVP and met the inclusion criteria between January 2007 and December 2013 at Hospital A (training cohort) and Hospital B (validation cohort) were included. In the training cohort, the independent risk factors for new VCFs after PVP were identified by multivariate stepwise backward Cox regression analysis from the risk factors selected by univariate analysis and Harrell's C-statistics and used to develop the score system (assessment for new VCFs after PVP [ANVCFV]) to predict the probability of new VCFs.
Results: 
In total, 397 patients (training cohort: n = 241; validation cohort: n = 156) were included in this study. In the training cohort, the ANVCFV score was developed based on 5 independent risk factors for the new VCFs after PVP, including lower computed tomography (CT) values, pre-existing old VCFs, intradiscal cement leakage, more than one vertebra treated, and superior or inferior marginal cement distribution in the vertebra. The patients were divided into 2 groups by the ANVCFV score of -1.5 to 8.5 vs. > 8.5 points in the probability of new VCFs (median fracture-free time: 1846 vs. 732 days; P < 0.001) in the training cohort. The accuracy of this score system was 77.4% for the training cohort and 85.3% for the validation cohort.
Limitations: 
The main limitations of this study are that it is a retrospective study and that there is a significant difference of the treated vertebrae of PVP per session between the 2 cohorts.
Conclusion: 
Patients who underwent their first PVP with an ANVCFV score > 8.5 points may exhibit an increased chance of suffering from new VCFs.},

To study therapeutic effects of self-designed canal decompressor in the posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, and provide evidence for widespread application.
Methods: 
From January 2008 to December 2008, the self-designed canal decompressor was used in 43 patients (30 males and 13 females, ranging in age from 22 to 49 years) with thoracolumbar burst fractures. According to Denis classification, there were 12 cases of type A, 24 cases of type B, 6 cases of type D and 1 case of type E. Affected segment: 16 patients in T12,19 patients in L1 and 8 patients in L2. The index of intra-operative blood loss, postoperative 24 h wound drainage volume, and operative time were compared with those of 16 patients who undergone traditional operation. The preoperative and postoperative vertebral canal volume, Cobb angles, residual vertebral body height, neurological outcome, and back pain were evaluated and compared.
Results: 
All the patients healed without wound infection, neurological symptoms and other complications. Forty-three patients were followed up ranging from 12 to 24 months, with a mean of (16.5 +/- 2.5) months. Compared with traditional posterior operation, the blood loss and operative time in modified posterior approach group had statistically significant difference, but the postoperative 24 h wound drainage had no significant difference between the two groups. CT scan indicated that applying the canal decompressor allowed efficient restore of canal volume from preoperative (49.4 +/- 16.7)% to postoperative (12.8 +/- 4.2)%. The X-ray showed Cobb angles reduced from preoperative (30.1 +/- 2.4)degrees to postoperative (5.1 +/- 0.6) degrees. Mean vertebral height was restored to (81.5 +/- 5.5)% after operation. Follow-up evaluation indicated that neurological recovery presented in 33 patients,with an average improvement of 0.87 Frankel grades. Neurological deterioration was not observed.
Conclusion: 
Applying the canal decompressor enables efficient and safe spinal decompression, restore the height of the injured vertebrae, reconstruction of the anterior-middle column stability,and prevention of postoperative vertebral height and Cobb angle lost.},

To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the modified traction arch of skull (crossbar traction arch) for skull traction in treating cervical spine injury by comparing with traditional traction arch of skull.
Methods: 
Between June 2009 and June 2013, 90 patients with cervical vertebrae fractures or dislocation were treated with modified skull traction surgery (trial group, n=45) and traditional skull traction surgery (control group, n=45). There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury types, injury level, the interval between injury and admission, and Frankel grading of spinal injury between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The clinical efficacy was evaluated after operation by the indexes such as traction arch slippage times, operation time, the infection incidence of the pin hole, incidence of skull perforation, visual analogue scale (VAS), and reduction status of cervical dislocation.
Results: 
The traction arch slippage times, the infection incidence of the pin hole, operation time, blood loss, and postoperative VAS score in trial group were significantly lower than those in control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of skull perforation caused by clamp crooks of traction arch between 2 groups (P=1.000). At 2 weeks after operation, the patients had no headaches, infections, or other complications in 2 groups. In patients with cervical dislocation, 4 of the trial group and 6 of the control group failed to be reset, the reduction rate was 83.33% (20/24) and 68.42% (13/19) respectively, showing no significant difference (χ2=0.618, P=0.432).
Conclusion: 
The operation with modified traction arch of skull has significant advantages to reduce postoperative complication compared with tradition traction arch of skull.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To initially evaluate the application of artificial vertebra of n-HA/PA66 in anterior reconstruction of lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation.
Methods: 
In this study, 84 patients with lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation received anterior cervical discectomy, spinal canal decompression or subtotal corpectomy, spinal canal decompression and reconstruction by n-HA/PA66 composite artificial vertebral body combined with plate instrumentation. Neurological function was followed up by improvement rate of Frankel and situations of the supporting body was observed by X ray and 3D-CT in 3, 12, 24 months postoperatively. The intervertebral height, physical arc (reflected by Cobb angle) and the locations and fusion rate of the supporting body were assessed in order to evaluate the stability of the cervical spine and alignment improvements.
Results: 
All the patients underwent operation successfully and were followed up for 6 to 24 months with an average of 12 months. The preoperative symptoms were improved to varying degrees. Imaging studies showed that in all cases graft fusion were achieved, and cervical alignments, intervertebral height, cervical spine stability and the locations of the artificial vertebral body were well maintained. No displacement and subsidence of the artificial vertebral body occurred. Postoperative immediate intervertebral height (2.4 ± 0.2) cm, preoperative intervertebral height (1.9 ± 0.1) cm, comparisons of the two groups was statistically significant (q = 2.48, P < 0.001). The immediate, 3 month, 1 year, 2 year period follow-up group intervertebral height was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Preoperative Cobb angle was 9.8° ± 1.2°, postoperative immediate Cobb angle was 16.6° ± 1.2°, comparisons of the two groups was statistically significant (q = 14.25, P < 0.001). The immediate, 3 month, 1 year, 2 year period follow-up group Cobb angle was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: 
n-HA/PA66 artificial vertebral body can provide early cervical spine support and stability and effectively maintain the biological alignment and cervical intervertebral height. It has high rate of graft fusion and is convenient to observe by X-ray. Therefore, n-HA/PA66 can be taken as an ideal graft for anterior lower cervical spine fracture and dislocation operation, but further follow-up study is still required to evaluate the long-term effects.},

  abstract={Background: 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of treating vertebral compression fractures using an autonomously developed nitinol memory alloy vertebral stent.
Material and methods: 
Thoracolumbar vertebral specimens from adult human cadavers were made into models of compression fractures. The models were divided into group A, which received percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP), balloon dilation, and nitinol memory alloy vertebral stent implantation (PKP + nitinol stent group); group B, which received percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and direct implantation of a nitinol memory alloy vertebral stent (PVP + nitinol stent group); and group C, which received PKP, balloon dilation, and bone cement vertebroplasty (PKP + polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) group). Vertebral heights were measured before and after the surgery and the water bath incubation to compare the impact of the 3 different surgical approaches on reducing vertebral compression.
Results: 
The 3 surgical groups could all significantly restore the heights of compressed vertebral bodies. The vertebral heights of the PKP + nitinol stent group, PVP + nitinol stent group, and PKP + PMMA group were changed from the preoperative levels of (1.59±0.08) cm, (1.68±0.08) cm, and (1.66±0.11) cm to the postoperative levels of (2.00±0.09) cm, (1.87±0.04) cm, and (1.99±0.09) cm, respectively. After the water bath, the vertebral heights of each group were changed to (2.10±0.07) cm, (1.98±0.09) cm, and (2.00±0.10) cm, respectively. Pairwise comparison of the differences between the preoperative and postoperative vertebral heights showed that group A and group B differed significantly (P=0.000); group B and group C differed significantly (P=0.003); and group A and group C had no significant difference (P=0.172). Pairwise comparison of the differences in the vertebral heights before and after the water bath showed that group A and group C differed significantly (P=0.000); group B and group C differed significantly (P=0.000); and group A and group B had no significant difference (P=0.157).
Conclusions: 
The nitinol memory alloy stents can effectively support and reduce the compression of vertebral endplates and can be used to treat vertebral compression fractures without neurological symptoms.},

To investigate the clinical effects and safety of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
From December 2004 to June 2008, 28 patients (40 vertebrae) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP group), there were 11 males (14 vertebrae) and 17 females (26 vertebrae), with an average age of 72 years (ranged, 70 to 91 years). The fracture site of vertebral body was from T5 to L5. Other 31 patients (43 vertebrae) were treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP group), there were 13 males (18 vertebrae) and 18 females (25 vertebrae), with an average age of 74 years (ranged, 70 to 92 years). The fracture site of vertebral body was from T4 to L5. Theapeutic effects of all the patients were observed after operation, the item included visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry score, Cobb angle, the height of anterior and middle column vertebra, and the incidence of cement leakage.
Results: 
There was significant decrease in VAS score and Oswestry score after operation in both groups, there was significant difference between preoperative and postoperative (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in VAS score and Oswestry score between two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in Cobb angles and the height of anterior and middle column vertebra between two groups before and after operation (P > 0.05). Among them, there were 3 vertebrae cement leakage in PVP group (7.5%) and 2 in PKP group (4.7%), but no clinical sympton occurred. There was no significant difference in the incidence of cement leakage between two groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective methods in treating senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, which can restore the height of fractured vertebra, relieve pain and improve function as well as minimize the incidence of cement leakage.},

  abstract={Assisted techniques (AT) for vertebral cementoplasty include multiple mini-invasive percutaneous systems in which vertebral augmentation is obtained through mechanical devices with the aim to reach the best vertebral height restoration. As an evolution of the vertebroplasty, the rationale of the AT-treatment is to combine the analgesic and stability effect of cement injection with the restoration of a physiological height for the collapsed vertebral body. Reduction of the vertebral body kyphotic deformity, considering the target of normal spine biomechanics, could improve all systemic potential complications evident in patient with vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Main indications for AT are related to fractures in fragile vertebral osseous matrix and non-osteoporotic vertebral lesions due to spine metastasis or trauma. Many companies developed different systems for AT having the same target but different working cannula, different vertebral height restoration system and costs. Aim of this review is to discuss about vertebral cementoplasty procedures and techniques, considering patient inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as all related minor and/or major interventional complications.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences between spinal metastasis and osteoporotic compression fractures on plain X-ray images, focusing on asymmetrical vertebral collapse and fracture level.
Materials and methods: 
This study included 180 patients with pathological collapse from spinal metastasis (188 vertebrae) who were treated at our institution and 70 patients (92 vertebrae) with osteoporotic compression fractures. Anteroposterior X-ray images of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine were evaluated for asymmetrical collapse deformity.
Results: 
Asymmetrical collapse was found in 134 vertebrae (71.3%) with metastasis, and in 20 osteoporotic vertebrae (21.7%); this difference was significant (p < 0.0001). The asymmetrical collapse angle in spinal metastasis patients ranged from 0 to 18°, with a mean of 7.0 and a standard deviation (SD) of 4.5. In contrast, the asymmetrical collapse angle in patients with osteoporotic fractures ranged from 0 to 13°, with a mean of 3.1 and a SD of 2.8. The difference in collapse angle between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The cutoff value to suspect spinal metastasis was determined to be 5° or more (sensitivity 0.67, specificity 0.74). Fracture at Th10 or below L3 was found in 20.2% of spinal metastasis patients; only 3% of osteoporotic fractures occurred at these levels.
Conclusion: 
Asymmetrical collapse with an angle of 5° or more and fractures at atypical levels on plain radiographs can be useful clues to spinal metastasis.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Systematic review and meta-regression.
Objectives: 
To compare the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, and to examine the prognostic factors that predict outcome.
Summary of background data: 
A previous systematic review of vertebroplasty by Levine et al in 2000 identified seven case series studies and no controlled studies.
Methods: 
A number of electronic databases were searched through March 1, 2004. Citation searches of included studies were undertaken and contact was made with experts in the field. No language restrictions were applied. All controlled and uncontrolled studies were included with the exception of case reports. Prognostic factors responsible for pain relief and cement leakage were examined using meta-regression.
Results: 
The following studies were included: balloon kyphoplasty (three nonrandomized comparative studies against conventional medical therapy and 13 case series), vertebroplasty (one nonrandomized comparative study against conventional medical care and 57 cases series), balloon kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty (one nonrandomized comparative study). The majority of studies were undertaken in older women with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with long-term pain that was refractory to medical treatment. At this time, there is no good quality direct comparative evidence of balloon kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty. From indirect comparison of case series evidence, the procedures appear to provide similar gains in pain relief while for balloon kyphoplasty there is better documentation of gains in patient functionality and quality of life. The level of cement leakage and number of reported adverse events (pulmonary emboli and neurologic injury) in balloon kyphoplasty was significantly lower than for vertebroplasty. These findings were confirmed by meta-regression analysis.
Conclusions: 
There is Level III evidence to support balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty as effective therapies in the management of patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures refractory to conventional medical therapy. Although there was a good ratio of benefit to harm for both procedures, balloon kyphoplasty appears to offer the better adverse event profile. These conclusions need to be updated on the basis of the findings of ongoing randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract={Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most prevalent fractures in osteoporotic patients. The classical conservative management of these fractures is through rest, pain medication, bracing and muscle relaxants. The aim of this paper is to review prospective controlled studies comparing the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive techniques for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), versus non-surgical management (NSM). The Fracture Working Group of the International Osteoporosis Foundation conducted a literature search and developed a review paper on VP and BKP. The results presented for the direct management of osteoporotic VCFs focused on clinical outcomes of these three different procedures, including reduction in pain, improvement of function and mobility, vertebral height restoration and decrease in spinal curvature (kyphosis). Overall, VP and BKP are generally safe procedures that provide quicker pain relief, mobility recovery and in some cases vertebral height restoration than conventional conservative medical treatment, at least in the short term. However, the long-term benefits and safety in terms of risk of subsequent vertebral fractures have not been clearly demonstrated and further prospective randomized studies are needed with standards for reporting. Referral physicians should be aware of VP/BKP and their potential to reduce the health impairment of patients with VCFs. However, VP and BKP are not substitutes for appropriate evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis to reduce the risk of future fractures.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
The purpose of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty compared to nonsurgical management and vertebroplasty for the treatment of hospitalised osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in the UK. A cost-effectiveness model was constructed and used for analysis. Balloon kyphoplasty may be cost-effective compared to relevant alternatives.
Introduction: 
The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) compared to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and nonsurgical management (NSM) in the UK.
Methods: 
A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate treatment with BKP, NSM and PVP in patients with symptomatic OVCF. Data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with acute OVCF were derived from the FREE and VERTOS II randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and normalised to the NSM arm in the FREE trial. Estimated differences in mortality among the treatments and costs for NSM were obtained from the literature whereas procedure costs for BKP and PVP were obtained from three National Health Service hospitals. It was assumed that BKP and PVP reduced hospital length of stay by 6 days compared to NSM.
Results: 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at Great Britain Pound Sterling (GBP) 2,706 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and GBP 15,982 per QALY compared to NSM and PVP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of BKP vs. NSM was robust when mortality and HRQoL benefits with BKP were varied. The cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to PVP was particularly sensitive to changes in the mortality benefit.
Conclusion: 
BKP may be a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute OVCF in the UK compared to NSM and PVP. Additional RCT data on the benefits of BKP and PVP compared to simulated sham surgery and further data on the mortality benefits with BKP compared to NSM and PVP would reduce uncertainty.},

  abstract={Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure indicated for treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures. During BKP, cannulae are placed percutaneously into the vertebral body, allowing insertion of inflatable balloons. Inflating the balloons partially restores vertebral body height, compacts the bone and creates a cavity for placement of bone cement after balloon removal. Placement of the cement reduces and stabilizes the fracture. BKP differs from vertebroplasty in that it aims to restore vertebral height and reduce kyphotic deformity. Case reports and observational studies have consistently shown that BKP significantly reduces pain, increases mobility and functional capacity and improves quality of life for up to 3 years. Clinically significant adverse events have been rarely reported. These findings were confirmed in randomized and nonrandomized prospective controlled studies. The objective of this review is to describe the surgical procedures involved in BKP and to review the evidence supporting its use.},

  abstract={Background: 
Both kyphoplasty (KP) and vertebroplasty (VP) are effective for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF), but which approach might be more effective remains unclear, so we decided to update earlier systematic reviews.
Objective: 
Review and analyze studies published as of August 2015 that compared clinical outcomes and complications of KP versus VP.
Design: 
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Search method: 
Published reports up to August 2015 were found in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).
Selection criteria: 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective cohort stud.ies comparing KP and VP in patients with OVCF.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two authors independently assessed the studies and extracted data.
Results: 
Thirty-two studies involving 3274 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were significant differences between the two groups in short- and long-term postoperative changes in measures of pain intensity and dysfunction (P < .01), in anterior and middle height (P < .01), kyphotic angle (P < .01), and time to injury, but not in posterior height (P=.178). There were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative fractures including adjacent and total fractures, but cement leakage to the intraspinal space was greater in the VP group (P=.035). KP surgery took longer and required a greater volume of injected cement.
Conclusions: 
KR resulted in better pain relief, improvements in Oswestry dysfunction and radiographic outcomes with less cement leakage, but further RCTs are needed to verify this conclusion.
Limitations: 
Only four RCTs with a certain of risk of bias. Most studies were observational.},

  abstract={Background: 
Non-randomised trials have reported benefits of kyphoplasty in patients with cancer and vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty compared with non-surgical management for patients with cancer who have painful VCFs.
Methods: 
The Cancer Patient Fracture Evaluation (CAFE) study was a randomised controlled trial at 22 sites in Europe, the USA, Canada, and Australia. We enrolled patients aged at least 21 years who had cancer and one to three painful VCFs. Patients were randomly assigned by a computer-generated minimisation randomisation algorithm to kyphoplasty or non-surgical management (control group). Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was back-specific functional status measured by the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) score at 1 month. Outcomes at 1 month were analysed by modified intention to treat, including all patients with data available at baseline and at 1 month follow-up. Patients in the control group were allowed to crossover to receive kyphoplasty after 1 month. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00211237.
Findings: 
Between May 16, 2005, and March 11, 2008, 134 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to kyphoplasty (n=70) or non-surgical management (n=64). 65 patients in the kyphoplasty group and 52 in the control group had data available at 1 month. The mean RDQ score in the kyphoplasty group changed from 17·6 at baseline to 9·1 at 1 month (mean change -8·3 points, 95% CI -6·4 to -10·2; p<0·0001). The mean score in the control group changed from 18·2 to 18·0 (mean change 0·1 points; 95% CI -0·8 to 1·0; p=0·83). At 1 month, the kyphoplasty treatment effect for RDQ was -8·4 points (95% CI -7·6 to -9·2; p<0·0001). The most common adverse events within the first month were back pain (four of 70 in the kyphoplasty group and five of 64 in the control group) and symptomatic vertebral fracture (two and three, respectively). One patient in the kyphoplasty group had an intraoperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, which resolved and was attributed to anaesthesia. Another patient in this group had a new VCF, which was thought to be device related.
Interpretation: 
For painful VCFs in patients with cancer, kyphoplasty is an effective and safe treatment that rapidly reduces pain and improves function.

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
The study investigated whether kyphoplasty (KP) was superior to vertebroplasty (VP) in treating patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). KP may be superior to VP for treating patients with OVCFs based on long-term VAS and ODI but not short-term VAS. Further large-scale trials are needed to verify these findings due to potential risk of selection bias.
Introduction: 
This study aimed to assess whether KP was superior to VP in treating patients with OVCFs.
Methods: 
The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases and references within articles and proceedings of major meetings were systematically searched. Eligible studies included patients with OVCFs who received either KP or VP. Standard mean differences (SMDs) and relative risks (RRs) were used as measures of efficacy and safety in a random-effects model.
Results: 
Eleven studies enrolling 869 patients with OVCFs were identified as eligible for final analysis. Compared with VP, KP was associated with significant improvements in long-term (SMD, -0.70; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: -1.30, -0.10; P = 0.023) visual analog scale (VAS); short-term (SMD, -1.50; 95 % CI: -2.94, -0.07; P = 0.040) and long-term (SMD, -1.03; 95 % CI: -1.88, -0.18; P = 0.017) Oswestry Disability Indexes (ODIs); short-term (SMD, -0.74; 95 % CI: -1.42, -0.06; P = 0.032) and long-term (SMD, -0.71; 95 % CI: -1.19, -0.23; P = 0.004) kyphosis angles; and vertebral body height (SMD, 1.56; 95 % CI: 0.62, 2.49; P = 0.001) and anterior vertebral body height (SMD, 3.04; 95 % CI: 0.53, 5.56; P = 0.018). KP was also associated with a significantly longer operation time (SMD, 0.73; 95 % CI: 0.26, 1.19; P = 0.002) and a lower risk of cement extravasation (RR, 0.68; 95 % CI: 0.48, 0.96; P = 0.030) compared with VP. No significant differences were found in the short-term VAS, posterior vertebral body height, and adjacent-level fractures.
Conclusion: 
Acknowledging some risk of selection bias, KP displayed a significantly better performance compared with VP only in one of the two primary endpoints, that is, for ODI but not for short-term VAS. Further randomized studies are required to confirm these results.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To assess the safety and efficacy of balloon kyphoplasty (KP) compared with percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and provide recommendations for using these procedures to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF).
Methods: 
A systematic search of all studies published through March 2012 was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, ScienceDirect and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials that compared KP to VP and provided data on safety and clinical effects were identified. Demographic characteristics, adverse events and clinical outcomes were manually extracted from all of the selected studies. The evidence quality levels and recommendations were assessed using the GRADE system.
Results: 
Twelve studies encompassing 1,081 patients met the inclusion criteria. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed according to the study design. In the RCT subgroup, there were significant differences between the two procedures in short-term visual analog scale (VAS), long-term kyphosis angles, operative times and anterior vertebrae heights. In the cohort study subgroup, there were significant differences between the two procedures in short- and long-term VAS, short- and long-term Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), cement leakage rates, short- and long-term kyphosis angles, operative times and anterior vertebrae heights. However, there were no significant differences in long-term VAS or adjacent vertebral fracture rates in the RCT subgroup. There were no significant differences in short- or long-term VAS, short- or long-term ODI, cement leakage rates, adjacent vertebral fracture rates, short- or long-term kyphosis angles or anterior vertebrae heights in the CCT subgroup, and the adjacent vertebral fracture rates did not differ significantly in the cohort study subgroup. The overall GRADE system evidence quality was very low, which lowers our confidence in their recommendations.
Conclusions: 
KP and VP are both safe and effective surgical procedures for treating OVCF. KP may be superior to VP in patients with large kyphosis angles, vertebral fissures, fractures in the posterior edge of the vertebral body or significant height loss in the fractured vertebrae. Due to the poor quality of the evidence currently available, high-quality RCTs are required.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
Bone pain and spinal axial deformity are major concerns in aged patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Pain can be relieved by vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty procedures, in which the compressed vertebral body is filled with substitutes. We randomly assigned 100 patients with osteoporotic compression fracture at the thoraco-lumbar (T-L) junction into two groups: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty; we used polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as the bone filler. Pain before and after treatment was assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) scores and vertebral body height and kyphotic wedge angle were measured from reconstructed computed tomography images. More PMMA was used in the kyphoplasty group than in the vertebroplasty group (5.56 +/- 0.62 vs. 4.91 +/- 0.65 mL, p < 0.001). Vertebral body height and kyphotic wedge angle of the T-L spine were also improved (p < 0.001). VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. The duration of follow-up was 6 months. Two patients in the kyphoplasty group had an adjacent segment fracture. In terms of clinical outcome there was little difference between the treatment groups. Thus, owing to the higher cost of the kyphotic balloon procedure, we recommend vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.
Introduction: 
Spinal axial deformities are major concerns in aged patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Pain may be relieved by vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. We investigated the radiological and clinical outcomes of these procedures.
Methods: 
One hundred cases of VCF at the thoraco-lumbar junction were randomly assigned into two groups: vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty (50 cases each). We used polymethylmethacrylate as the bone filler. Pain before and after treatment was assessed with visual analog scale scores and vertebral body height and kyphotic wedge angle were measured from reconstructed computed tomography images.
Results: 
More PMMA was used in the kyphoplasty group than in the vertebroplasty group (5.56 +/- 0.62 vs. 4.91 +/- 0.65 mL, p < 0.001).

  abstract={Background context: 
Among different types of cement leakage in percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures, leaks into the spinal canal are considered to be the most common complication. One potential structure causing this type of cement leakage is the potential connection between the basivertebral foramen and the intravertebral cleft, which is revealed clearly on magnetic resonance (MR) images, but is often ignored in the literature.
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence rate of different types of cement leakage in PKP with or without intravertebral clefts and to determine whether the basivertebral foramen could be connected to the intravertebral cleft.
Study design: 
This study is a retrospective assessment of the presence of an intravertebral cleft in osteoporotic vertebral bodies and the different types of cement leakage after PKP on radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and MR images.
Patient sample: 
A total of 164 consecutive patients underwent PKP to treat 204 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Outcome measures: 
Outcome measures include the occurrence of different types of cement leakage in the groups with an intravertebral cleft and without intravertebral clefts.
Methods: 
A total of 204 vertebrae in 164 consecutive patients who underwent PKP to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were classified into two patterns based on preoperative radiographs, CT scans, and/or MR images of the treated levels: cleft pattern (with an intravertebral cleft in the vertebral body) and trabecular pattern (without intravertebral clefts). When an intravertebral cleft was identified, the investigators examined the basivertebral foramen and looked for a communication between the two structures on three-dimensional CT scans and MR images. On direct postoperative images, the patterns of cement leakage were classified as five types: type A, through a cortical defect into the paraspinal soft tissues; type B, through the basivertebral foramen; type C, via the needle channel; type D, through a cortical defect into the disc space; and type E, via the paravertebral vein. The association of the distribution of the cement leakage and the presence of an intravertebral cleft was analyzed retrospectively. Moreover, the association of type B leakage with the communication between the basivertebral foramen and the intravertebral cleft was also assessed.
Results: 
The average interobserver kappa values for determining the type of cement leakage and the presence of intravertebral cleft were 0.916 (range, 0.792-1) and 0.935, respectively. In 41 of 204 vertebrae (19.9%), an intravertebral cleft was confirmed on preoperative images. A communication between the intravertebral cleft and the basivertebral foramen was seen in 10 vertebrae (24.4%). Cement leakage was 36.2% in the group with a trabecular pattern and 41.5% in the group with a cleft pattern (p>.05). Leaks through the basivertebral foramen (type B; N=30, 14.7%) and through cortical defects into the disc space (type D; N=14, 6.9%) were more common than other types. Twenty of 163 vertebrae with the trabecular pattern (12.3%) and 10 of 41 vertebrae with the cleft pattern (24.4%) were identified as type B leaks, which reached statistical significance (p<.05). There was no statistical difference between the trabecular pattern and the cleft pattern on other types of leaks.
Conclusions: 
Type B leaks are more common in vertebrae with an intravertebral cleft, which supports the presence of a connection between an intravertebral cleft and the basivertebral foramen. Thus, care must be taken when PKP is performed in these patients to avoid direct cement leakage into the spinal canal through the basivertebral foramen.},

  abstract={Background: 
Odontoid fractures are the most common odontoid injury and often cause atlantoaxial instability. Reports on postoperative status of patients who underwent surgery for such injuries are limited to small case series, and it is unclear whether any one technique produces better outcomes than another.
Questions::Purposes: 
We assessed the quality of the available literature for management of Type II odontoid fractures and surgery-related parameters, including surgical indications, clinical failure rate, and survivorship, postoperative ROM and function, neurologic deficits, complication and death rates, and radiographic healing rates related to either anterior dens screw or posterior C1-C2 fusion.
Methods: 
We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar databases. We used the methodology score proposed by Coleman et al. to rate study quality. Postoperative imaging bone union rates were extracted. Postoperative complications and neurologic impairment data were also collected.
Results: 
Sixteen retrospective studies of overall low quality (average methodology score, 37.1) reporting a total of 518 patients were included. The methodology score and publication year were positively associated. The bone union rate approximated 83% (range, 33%-100%), with higher nonunion rates among patients older than 65 years. The death rate ranged widely (0%-28.6%) among different centers. Residual cervical pain was documented postoperatively from 10.5% to 26.7%, while survivorship ranged from 72% to 96.6%. No ROM data were reported.
Conclusions: 
Current data on patients who had surgery for fracture of the dens did not allow us to establish superiority of one surgical approach over another.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare clinical outcomes of bilateral transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of ordinary osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture (OVCF) and severe osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture.
Methods: 
From Junary 2009 to Febuary 2011, 60 patients (70 vertebrae) with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture were included. All patients were treated by bilateral transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty combined with postural reduction, including 10 males and 50 females aged from 59 to 90 years old with an average of 72.1 years old. In ordinary osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture group, there were 38 patients (44 vertebrae) including 7 males and 31 females aged from 59 to 87 years old with an average of (71.8±6.1) years old. There were 6 patients with two vertebral fractures, 1 vertebra in T9, 5 vertebrae in T10, 7 vertebrae in T11, 13 vertebrae in T12, 9 vertebrae in L1, 4 vertebrae in L2, 4 vertebrae in L3, 1 vertebra in L4. While in severe osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture group, there were 22 patients (26 vertebrae) including 3 males and 19 females aged from 63 to 90 years old with an average of (72.6±7.2) years old. There were 4 patients with two vertebral fractures, 1 vertebra in T9, 2 vertebrae in T10, 3 vertebrae in T11, 9 vertebrae in T12, 6 vertebrae in L1, 3 vertebrae in L2, 2 vertebrae in L3. Operative time, volume of bone cement injection, and vertebral height and changes of Cobb angle before and after operation were observed and compared. Postoperative average recovery rate of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle were caculated and compared, VAS scoring were used to evaluate therapeutic effect.
Results: 
All operations were completed sucessfully, and pain were relieved at 72 h after operation. All patients were followed up from 6 to 13 months with an average of 10.1 months. Postoperative vertebral height, Cobb angle and VAS score were improved better than that of before operation (P<0.05). Operative time in ordinary group was shorter than severe group, while volume of bone cement injection was more than that of severe group. Average recovery rate of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle in ordinarty group was better than that of in severe group (P<0.05). There was no significant differences between two groups in VAS scores before and after operation (P> 0.05). Three cases (3 vertebrae) ocurred bone cement leakage in ordinarty group, while 5 cases (5 vertebrae) ocurred bone cement leakage in severe group, and there was no meaning between two groups (P>0.05).
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty could receive satisfied curative effect in treating ordinary and servere patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture, but recovery of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle in ordinary gourp was better than that of in servere group.},

  abstract={Treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. Long-segment pedicle screw constructs may be stiffer and impart greater forces on adjacent segments compared with short-segment constructs, which may affect clinical performance and long-term out come. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically evaluate long-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation (LSPF) vs short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation (SSPF) for unstable burst fractures. Six unembalmed human thoracolumbar spine specimens (T10-L4) were used. Following intact testing, a simulated L1 burst fracture was created and sequentially stabilized using 5.5-mm titanium polyaxial pedicle screws and rods for 4 different constructs: SSPF (1 level above and below), SSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level), LSPF (2 levels above and below), and LSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level). Each fixation construct was tested in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation; range of motion was also recorded. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to identify differences between treatment groups and functional noninstrumented spine. Short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation did not achieve stability seen in an intact spine (P<.01), whereas LSPF constructs were significantly stiffer than SSPF constructs and demonstrated more stiffness than an intact spine (P<.01). Pedicle screws at the fracture level did not improve either SSPF or LSPF construct stability (P>.1). Long-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation constructs were not associated with increased adjacent segment motion. Al though the sample size of 6 specimens was small, this study may help guide clinical decisions regarding burst fracture stabilization. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(3):e514-e518.].},

  abstract={Background: 
Pseudoarthrosis after pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) can require revision surgery due to posterior rod failure, and the stiffness of these revision constructs has not been quantified.
Objective: 
To compare the multidirectional bending stiffness of 7 revision strategies following rod failure.
Methods: 
Seven fresh-frozen human spines (T11-pelvis) were tested as follows: (1) posterior instrumentation from T12-S1 (excluding L3) with iliac fixation and L3 PSO; (2) inline connectors after rod breakage at L3 (L2 screws removed for access); (3) cross-links connecting rods above and below inline connectors; satellite rods (4) parallel, (5) 45° anterior, and (6) 45° posterior to original rods; 45° posterior with cross-links connecting (7) original and (8) satellite rods. Groups 3 to 8 were tested in random order. Nondestructive pure moment flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR) tests were conducted to 7.5 Nm; 3D motion tracking monitored the primary range of motion.
Results: 
Addition of inline connectors alone restored stiffness in FE and LB (P > .05), but not in AR (P < .05). Satellite rods (groups 4 to 6) restored stiffness in FE and LB (P > .05), but not in AR (P < .05) and were not significantly different from one another (P > .05). The addition of cross-links (groups 3, 7, and 8) restored stiffness in all bending modes (P > .05) and were significantly greater than inline connectors alone in AR (P < .05).
Conclusion: 
The results suggest that these revision strategies can restore stiffness without entire rod replacement. Failure of AR stiffness restoration can be mitigated with cross-links. The positioning of the satellite rods is not an important factor in strengthening the revision.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Currently, the effect of the volume of cement used during sacroplasty on the restoration of pelvic strength and stiffness is unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure that effect in a sacral insufficiency fracture model.
Materials and methods: 
Twenty-five osteoporotic cadaveric pelves were potted, and sacral fractures were produced. Specimens were divided into 4 groups: group 0 + 0 (control), no sacroplasty; group 3 + 0, sacroplasty (posterior approach), 3 mL of a bone cement injected bilaterally into the fracture site at S1; group 3 + 3, sacroplasty (posterior approach), 3 mL of the same cement injected bilaterally into the fracture site at S1 and S2; and group 6 + 3, sacroplasty (posterior approach), 6 mL of the same cement injected bilaterally at S1 and 3 mL injected bilaterally at S2. Cement position and extravasation were documented with CT. Specimens were tested to failure to assess the strength and stiffness after sacroplasty.
Results: 
There were no significant differences in strength or stiffness restoration between control and treatment groups.
Conclusions: 
Sacroplasty does not restore the strength or stiffness of the sacrum in a cadaveric model regardless of the volume or location of cement.},

  abstract={Currently, evaluation of the stability of spinal instrumentations often focuses on simple pull-out or cyclic loading. However, the loading characteristics and the specimen alignment rarely simulate physiological loading conditions, or the clinical situation itself. The purpose of this study was to develop an alternative setup and parameters to compare static and dynamic characteristics of pedicle screws at the bone-implant interface in lumbar osteoporotic cadavers. A corpectomy model development was based on ASTM-1717 standard, allowing a deflection of the cranial and caudal element under loading. Twelve human osteoporotic vertebrae (L1-L4) were analyzed for morphological CT-data and T-Score. For group A (n = 6) loads were simulated as in vivo measurements during walking, representing 2 months postoperatively. A subsequent pull-out was performed. Group B (n = 6) was tested with pure pull-out. Screw loosening at the tip/head was optically measured and analyzed with respect to clinical patterns. Correlations between CT-data, T-Score, and in vitro parameters were determined. For group A, the subsidence for the head/tip was measured towards the upper/lower endplate, resulting in visible deflections. The progress of the subsidence was greatest within the first and last cycles until failure. The predominant patterns were pure rotation and toggling. However, the pull-out between groups was not significantly different. Pedicle-angle and cyclic-subsidence correlated with R = 0.806/0.794. T-Score and pull-out correlated only in group A. With the corpectomy setup, clinically observed wipe effects and a loss of correction could be simulated. The presented parameters facilitate analysis of the complex changing load distributions and interactions between the left and right bone-implant interface. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Biomechanical laboratory research.
Objective: 
To compare 4 techniques for vertebral body insufficiency fracture repair by analyzing restoration of height, strength, and stiffness, and quantifying cement leakage.
Summary of background data: 
Current techniques for insufficiency fracture repair, restore prefracture strength, and all potentially have the complication of cement extrusion. To our knowledge, there is no information directly comparing different augmentation techniques.
Methods: 
There were 4 osteoporotic/osteopenic fresh cadaveric spines' (T6-L5) vertebral bodies divided into the 4 groups and by levels (thoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbar). They were compressed to 25% of their initial height to simulate insufficiency fractures. Fixation techniques were vertebroplasty, osteoplasty (Interpore Cross Int., Irvine, CA), the Cavity Creation System (Synthes, Paoli, PA), and kyphoplasty (Kyphon, Sunnyvale, CA). Fractures were fixed using 3 cc of bone cement and recompressed.
Results: 
No significant difference was found in strength, height restoration, or stiffness among techniques (P < 0.05). Stiffness was significantly different in the lumbar levels between initial and post-fixation measurements (P < 0.05). Cement extrusion of 1 mL was seen in 1 vertebroplasty specimen.
Conclusions: 
The 4 techniques equally restored strength and stiffness. No difference was seen in height restoration. Cement extrusion was significant in only 1 vertebral body, which may be attributable to the cement quantity.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Expansive pedicle screws (EPS) and polymethylmethacrylate-augmented pedicle screws (PMMA-PS) were inserted into osteoporotic synthetic bones, which were then tested by radiographic and biomechanical examinations.
Objective: 
To compare the stability of EPS and PMMA-PS with that of a conventional pedicle screw (CPS) in an osteoporotic synthetic bone.
Summary of background data: 
It is a significant challenge for orthopedic surgeons performing transpedicular fixation in the osteoporotic spine. Prior studies have suggested that both EPS and PMMA-PS can increase the screw stability effectively. However, there are no biomechanical comparisons of EPS and PMMA-PS, especially in primary spinal surgery in osteoporosis.
Methods: 
Thirty osteoporotic synthetic bone blocks were divided into 3 groups randomly. A pilot hole was prepared in advance in all samples by the same method. Then, the CPS was inserted directly into the pilot hole in the CPS group; the hole in the PMMA-PS group was first filled with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; 2.5 mL) and then inserted with CPS, and the EPS was inserted directly into the blocks in the EPS group. Twenty-four hours later, x-ray and computed tomography examination and axial pullout tests were performed on all samples; the block destructions were then recorded, and the hole diameters were measured.
Results: 
In the CPS group, the screw was surrounded directly by the synthetic bone without any other materials, whereas in the PMMA-PS group, the screw was totally wrapped up by PMMA, and the PMMA was evenly distributed in the synthetic bone around the screw, indicating obvious improvement of the local density around the track. In the EPS group, the anterior part of the EPS presented an obvious expansion in synthetic bone and formed an unguiform structure pressing the surrounding synthetic bone. Screw stabilities in both the PMMA-PS and the EPS groups were significantly enhanced compared with those in the CPS group, and the screw stability in the PMMA-PS group was significantly higher than that in the EPS group. After the pullout tests, the block destructions were the most severe in the PMMA-PS group and the lightest in the CPS group. Hole diameters in the PMMA-PS and the EPS groups were significantly larger than that in the CPS group, whereas the diameter of the hole in the PMMA-PS group was significantly greater than that in the EPS group.
Conclusions: 
EPS can significantly increase the strength of screw fixation compared with CPS in osteoporotic synthetic bone. Although EPS shows a weaker fixation strength compared with PMMA-PS in the osteoporotic synthetic bone, it may still provide an alternative option to prevent screw loosening in the clinical treatment of osteoporosis.},

Summary of background data: 
The biomechanical stabilizing effect of sacroplasty is unknown.
Methods: 
Using a sacral insufficiency fracture model, we performed sacroplasty in 15 osteoporotic cadaveric pelves. Five served as controls, and 10 were each injected with 4 mL of a polymethylmethacrylate cement (5 via a posterior approach, 5 via a lateral approach). Cement extravasation was assessed using computed tomography. Restored strength and stiffness were defined as the ratios of treatment to initial strength and to stiffness, respectively. Between-group differences in restoration parameters were checked for significance (P < 0.05) using an analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test.
Results: 
We found no significant differences between groups in terms of restored strength ( approximately 61%) and stiffness ( approximately 77%). Both injection methods produced extravasation into the anterior sacrum, the posterior sacrum, the sacroiliac joint, and the neural foramens.
Conclusion: 
Sacroplasty with 4 mL of cement does not restore the strength or stiffness of the sacrum in a cadaveric model, regardless of the approach used.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Randomized controlled trial with statistically significant difference or statistically no significant difference (Level I).
Objective: 
The purpose of this study was to measure the mechanical stability of odontoid plate fixation, using a specially designed plate construct and to compare the results with those after odontoid single-screw and double-screw fixation.
Summary of background data: 
Plate fixation of the odontoid process without C1-C2 is a possible option for the management of odontoid fractures that are not suitable for conventional screw fixation. Although earlier biomechanical works have evaluated the effectiveness of different odontoid screw fixation techniques, no study has quantified the mechanical stability of odontoid fixation by a plate device.
Methods: 
The second cervical vertebra was removed from 15 fresh human spinal columns. The specimens were fixed to the experimental apparatus with the load cell at the articular surface of the odontoid process. In the first test series, stiffness and failure load of the intact odontoid were measured. Type II odontoid fractures were created by a 45 degree oblique extension loading at the articular surface of the odontoid process. Afterward, the specimens were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 groups: in group I (n=5), the fractures were stabilized, using a specially designed plate construct, in group II, the fractures were fixed, using two 3.5 mm cortical screws, and in group III, we used 1 regular 4.5 mm cortical screw. In the second test series, stiffness and failure load of the stabilized odontoid fractures were assessed for comparison and statistical analysis.
Results: 
Group I (plate device) showed a significantly higher mean failure load than group II and group III. The mean failure load of group I, after fixation of the odontoid fracture, was 84% of the mean failure load that was necessary to create a type II odontoid fracture initially. Comparing group II (double screw technique) and group III (single screw technique), there was no significant difference regarding the mean failure load. In both groups, the mean failure load after odontoid fixation was approximately 50% of the mean failure load of the intact odontoid. Statistical analysis also revealed a significantly higher stiffness of the stabilized odontoid after plate fixation than after single- or double-screw fixation.
Conclusions: 
Plate fixation of the odontoid process for certain type II odontoid fracture patterns provided a significantly higher biomechanical stability than the technique of odontoid screw fixation. Using a specially designed plate construct fixed with 2 cancellous screws into the body of C2 and an additional cortical screw inserted in the odontoid process, 84% of the original stability of the intact odontoid was restored. Single- or double-screw fixation of the odontoid only restored approximately 50% of the original strength.},

  abstract={Vertical sacral fracture is one of the most difficult fractures to treat. Posterior fixation using spinal dual rods is a novel method for treating this fracture, but its biomechanical strength has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical strength produced by posterior fixation using spinal instrumentation. Sacral fractures were created in eight pelvic bone models and classifi ed into a posterior plate fixation group [P group, n＝4] and a spinal instrumentation group [R group, n＝4]. The biomechanical strength was tested by pushing down on the S1 vertebra from the top. The mean maximum loads were 1,057.4 N and 1,489.4 N in the P and R groups, respectively (p＝ 0.014). The loads applied to the construct at displacements of 5mm and 7.5mm from the start of the universal testing machine loading were also significantly higher in the R group. The mean stiffness levels in the P and R groups were 88.3N/mm and 119.6N/mm, respectively (p＝0.014). Posterior fixation using spinal instrumentation is biomechanically stronger than conventional posterior plate fixation. This procedure may be the optimal method for treating unstable sacral fracture fixation.},

In vitro biomechanical investigation of 1 and 2-screw anterior scoliosis constructs with varying screw diameters.
Objective: 
To determine a possible optimal configuration of screw number and diameter at varying levels within the thoracic spine for anterior vertebral body fixation.
Summary of background data: 
Single-rod systems are typical in anterior thoracic and thoracolumbar correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; although dual rod systems may offer more flexural stability. Loss of fixation remains problematic, particularly in the proximal thoracic vertebrae, and it remains unclear how screw diameter or the number of screws within the vertebrae affect fixation.
Methods: 
Individual vertebral levels from 10 cadaveric thoracic spines were randomly assigned to either 1 or 2 screws of 5, 6, or 7-mm diameter. Bone-screw interface failures were created in coronal plane cantilever plow, and failure loads were compared across vertebral levels for each instrumentation method.
Results: 
Two-screw constructs had significantly higher failure loads than single-screw constructs, while increasing screw diameter also produced significant changes in fixation strength. Two-screws had improved performance in the mid and lower thoracic spine, while a single screw was more stable in the upper thoracic spine.
Conclusions: 
Failure modes for 1-screw constructs almost entirely (89%) showed gradual plowing through the bone, whereas acute fracture through the vertebral body or pedicles were common forms of failure (85%) for 2-screw constructs.},

  abstract={Object: 
Increased structural stability is considered sufficient justification for higher-risk surgical procedures, such as circumferential fixation after severe spinal destabilization. However, there is little biomechanical evidence to support such claims, particularly after traumatic lumbar burst fracture. The authors sought out to compare the biomechanical performance of the following 3 fixation strategies for spinal reconstruction after decompression for an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture: 1) short-segment anterolateral fixation; 2) circumferential fixation; and 3) extended anterolateral fixation.
Methods: 
Thoracolumbar spines (T10-L4) from 7 donors (mean age at death 64+/-6 years; 1 female and 6 males) were tested in pure moment loading in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Thoracolumbar burst fractures were surgically induced at L-1, and testing was repeated sequentially for each of the following fixation techniques: short-segment anterolateral, circumferential, and extended anterolateral. Primary and coupled 3D motions were measured across the instrumented site (T12-L2) and compared across treatment groups.
Results: 
Circumferential and extended anterolateral fixations were statistically equivalent for primary and off-axis range-of-motions in all loading directions, and short-segment anterolateral fixation offered significantly less rigidity than the other 2 methods.
Conclusions: 
The results of this study strongly suggest that extended anterolateral fixation is biomechanically comparable to circumferential fusion in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with posterior column and posterior ligamentous injury. In cases in which an anterior procedure may be favored for load sharing or canal decompression, extension of the anterior instrumentation and fusion one level above and below the unstable segment can result in near equivalent stability to a 2-stage circumferential procedure.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Biomechanical cadaveric bench study.
Objective: 
To measure motion at the fracture site in an osteoporotic cadaveric sacral insufficiency fracture model before and after fracture creation, after fixation (via 1 of 3 fixation techniques), and after cyclic loading and to compare those values with motion of the intact pelvis.
Summary of background data: 
Sacral insufficiency fractures occur frequently in the elderly and pose treatment challenges. Screw fixation and sacroplasty have been proposed as possible treatments. There is little information about the stabilization provided by these treatments.
Methods: 
We potted 18 osteoporotic cadaveric pelves, mounted them on a materials testing machine, measured sacroiliac (SI) joint motion with a vertical load applied to the lumbar spine, and created simulated sacral insufficiency fractures. Then, we measured fracture site motion under load and repaired the fracture using 1 of 3 techniques: a unilateral SI screw, a bilateral SI screw, or sacroplasty. A vertical compressive load (10-350 N) was applied cyclically at 0.5 Hz to the lumbar spine of the repaired specimens for 5000 cycles. Kinematic analysis was conducted prefracture, postfracture, postrepair, and after cyclic loading.
Results: 
Postfracture, there was a significant increase in motion relative to the intact SI joint. After fixation, the average motion in all 3 groups was similar to that of the intact pelvis. After cyclical loading, motion increased in all groups. No significant differences were found between treatments.
Conclusion: 
All 3 fixation methods resulted acutely in motion similar to that of the intact pelvis. Although motion increased as a function of cyclical loading, no significant differences were found between fixation methods. All 3 repair methods reduced fracture site motion, but clinical studies are needed to determine if each method relieves pain and provides sufficient fixation for fracture healing.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A cadaveric study comparing the biomechanics of unipedicular versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Objectives: 
The objectives of this study were to compare unipedicular kyphoplasty to bipedicular kyphoplasty in restoring strength, stiffness, and height to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and to study the degree of unilateral wedging when using a unipedicular versus bipedicular approach to kyphoplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a common ailment of the elderly that can lead to chronic pain and deformity. Recently developed treatments known as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty provide pain relief by percutaneously augmenting the fractured vertebral body with polymethyl methacrylate via a transpedicular approach. Vertebroplasty via a unipedicular approach has been shown to provide comparable restoration of vertebral body stiffness when compared to a bipedicular approach. The anticipated benefits of a unipedicular approach include reduction in patient risk, operative time, radiation exposure, and cost. No studies have evaluated the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty.
Material and methods: 
Two fresh-frozen human cadaveric spines (T3-L5) were disarticulated, and the vertebral bodies (n = 30) were compressed using an Instron 8521 machine, recording load versus displacement. The fractured vertebral bodies then underwent kyphoplasty via either a unipedicular or bipedicular approach. The augmented vertebral bodies were then recompressed. The strength, stiffness, and height restoration of the groups were compared. Following recompression, the risk for lateral wedging was evaluated by comparing lateral height measurements.
Results: 
Following fracture and subsequent kyphoplasty augmentation, the mean strength of the bipedicular group was 1.40 kN (+/- 0.38) versus 1.57 kN (+/- 0.55) in the unipedicular group. Average stiffness in the bipedicular group was 0.4387 kN/mm (+/- 0.2095) compared to 0.6880 kN/mm (+/- 0.3179) in the unipedicular group. Postcompression vertebral body height was restored to 96% of prefracture height in the bipedicular group and 94% of prefracture height in the unipedicular group. The mean absolute value of the difference in height between right and left side of the vertebral bodies was 1.06 mm (+/- 1.01) in the bipedicular group, whereas the unipedicular group had a mean of 1.78 mm (+/- 1.84). Statistical analysis using 1-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in any of the outcome measurements between the unipedicular and bipedicular groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
Unipedicular kyphoplasty is comparable to bipedicular kyphoplasty in the restoration of vertebral body strength, stiffness, and height in experimentally induced vertebral compression fractures. There was no greater risk for lateral wedging in the unipedicular group compared to the bipedicular group. Given the advantages of a unipedicular approach with respect to vertebral pedicle cannulation risk, operative time, radiation exposure, and cost, this study would support the use of a unipedicular approach to kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Vertebral augmentation with PMMA is a widely applied treatment of vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures. Subsequent fractures are a common complication, possibly due to the relatively high stiffness of PMMA in comparison with bone. Silicone as an augmentation material has biomechanical properties closer to those of bone and might, therefore, be an alternative. The study aimed to investigate the biomechanical differences, especially stiffness, of vertebral bodies with two augmentation materials and two filling grades.
Methods: 
Forty intact human osteoporotic vertebrae (T10-L5) were studied. Wedge fractures were produced in a standardized manner. For treatment, PMMA and silicone at two filling grades (16 and 35 % vertebral body fill) were assigned to four groups. Each specimen received 5,000 load cycles with a high load range of 20-65 % of fracture force, and stiffness was measured. Additional low-load stiffness measurements (100-500 N) were performed for intact and augmented vertebrae and after cyclic loading.
Results: 
Low-load stiffness testing after cyclic loading normalized to intact vertebrae showed increased stiffness with 35 and 16 % PMMA (115 and 110 %) and reduced stiffness with 35 and 16 % silicone (87 and 82 %). After cyclic loading (high load range), the stiffness normalized to the untreated vertebrae was 361 and 304 % with 35 and 16 % PMMA, and 243 and 222 % with 35 and 16 % silicone augmentation. For both high and low load ranges, the augmentation material had a significant effect on the stiffness of the augmented vertebra, while the filling grade did not significantly affect stiffness.
Conclusions: 
This study for the first time directly compared the stiffness of silicone-augmented and PMMA-augmented vertebral bodies. Silicone may be a viable option in the treatment of osteoporotic fractures and it has the biomechanical potential to reduce the risk of secondary fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
For many type II fractures of the dens (Anderson and D'Alonzo classification), a double anterior screw fixation is performed. If screw disruption occurs, the location is most often at the anterior caudal endplate and body of the axis and not directly at the fracture line. The authors' objective was to determine the differences in primary mechanical stability at 2 insertion points used in ventral screw fixation of type II fractures of the C-2 dens.
Methods: 
Screw fixation was performed on 16 formalin-fixed human C-2 dens specimens. The specimens were divided into 2 groups. For group 1, the screws were inserted directly at the anterior lower endplates; for group 2, the screws were inserted 2 mm dorsal to the anterior wall of the vertebral body. After a type II odontoid fracture was created with an oscillating saw, screw fixation was performed using two 3.5-mm partially threaded lag screws with washers. Subsequently, each vertebral body was continuously loaded. The criterion for breakage was reversal of the force vector.
Results: 
In group 1, screw disruption occurred at the point of entry; the mean load failure was 290.5 ± 106 N. In group 2, no screw disruption occurred; the mean load failure was 574.2 ± 170.5 N. These results were significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
For double screw fixation of type II fractures of the dens (Anderson and D'Alonzo classification), placement of the screws as far dorsal to the anterior lower endplate as possible seems to favorably affect primary stability. In actual clinical practice, care should be taken to not damage the anterior wall of the vertebral body of the axis during screw insertion.},

  abstract={The technology used in surgery for spinal deformity has progressed rapidly in recent years. Commonly used fixation techniques may include monofilament wires, sublaminar wires and cables, and pedicle screws. Unfortunately, neurological complications can occur with all of these, compromising the patients' health and quality of life. Recently, an alternative fixation technique using a metal clamp and polyester belt was developed to replace hooks and sublaminar wiring in scoliosis surgery. The goal of this study was to compare the pull-out strength of this new construct with sublaminar wiring, laminar hooks and pedicle screws. Forty thoracic vertebrae from five fresh frozen human thoracic spines (T5-12) were divided into five groups (8 per group), such that BMD values, pedicle diameter, and vertebral levels were equally distributed. They were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate and anchored with metal screws and polyethylene bands. One of five fixation methods was applied to the right side of the vertebra in each group: Pedicle screw, sublaminar belt with clamp, figure-8 belt with clamp, sublaminar wire, or laminar hook. Pull-out strength was then assessed using a custom jig in a servohydraulic tester. The mean failure load of the pedicle screw group was significantly larger than that of the figure-8 clamp (P = 0.001), sublaminar belt (0.0172), and sublaminar wire groups (P = 0.04) with no significant difference in pull-out strength between the latter three constructs. The most common mode of failure was the fracture of the pedicle. BMD was significantly correlated with failure load only in the figure-8 clamp and pedicle screw constructs. Only the pedicle screw had a statistically significant higher failure load than the sublaminar clamp. The sublaminar method of applying the belt and clamp device was superior to the figure-8 method. The sublaminar belt and clamp construct compared favorably to the traditional methods of sublaminar wires and laminar hooks, and should be considered as an alternative fixation device in the thoracic spine.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Destructive biomechanical tests using fresh cadaveric thoracolumbar vertebral bodies.
Objectives: 
To evaluate the compression strength of human vertebral bodies injected with a new calcium phosphate (CaP) cement with improved infiltration properties for augmentation of the vertebral bodies before compression fracture and also for vertebroplasty in comparison with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty is the percutaneous injection of PMMA cement into the vertebral body. While PMMA has high mechanical strength, it cures fast and thus allows only a short handling time. Other potential problems of using PMMA injection may include damage to surrounding tissues by a high polymerization temperature or by the unreacted toxic monomer, and the lack of long-term biocompatibility. Bone mineral cements, such as calcium carbonate and CaP cements, have longer working time and low thermal effect. They are also biodegradable while having a good mechanical strength. However, the viscosity of injectable mineral cements is high, and the infiltration of these cements into vertebral body has been questioned. Recently, the infiltration properties of a CaP cement have been significantly improved, which is ideal for the transpedicular injection to the vertebral bodies for vertebroplasty or augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral body strength.
Methods: 
The bone mineral densities of 30 vertebral bodies (T2-L1) were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Ten control specimens were compressed at a loading rate of 15 mm/min to 50% of their original height. The other specimens had 6 mL of PMMA (n = 10) or the new CaP (n = 10) cement injected through the bilateral pedicle approach before being loaded in compression. Additionally, after the control specimens had been compressed, they were injected with either CaP (n = 5) or PMMA (n = 5) cement using the same technique, to simulate vertebroplasty. Loading experiments were repeated with the displacement control of 50% vertebral height. Load to failure was compared among groups and analyzed using analysis of variance.
Results: 
Mean bone mineral densities of all five groups were similar and ranged from 0.56 to 0.89 g/cm2. The size of the vertebral body and the amount of cement injected were similar in all groups. Load to failure values for PMMA, the new CaP, and vertebroplasty PMMA were significantly greater than that of control. Load to failure of the vertebroplasty CaP group was higher than control but not statistically significant. The mean stiffness of the vertebroplasty CaP group was significantly smaller than control, PMMA, and the new CaP groups. The mean height gains after injection of the new CaP and PMMA cements for vertebroplasty were minimal (3.56% and 2.01%, respectively).
Conclusion: 
Results of this study demonstrated that the new CaP cement can be injected and infiltrates easily into the vertebral body. It was also found that injection of the new CaP cement can improve the strength of a fractured vertebral body to at least the level of its intact strength. Thus, the new CaP cement may be a good alternative to PMMA cement for vertebroplasty, although further in vivo animal and clinical studies should be done. Furthermore, the new CaP may be more effective in augmenting the strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies for preventing compression fractures considering our biomechanical testing data and the known potential for biodegradability of the new CaP cement.},

  abstract={Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have been used for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. We performed kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement (CPC) and PMMA to compare the biomechanical properties. Thirty osteoporotic vertebrae were harvested from nine embalmed cadavers. We randomized the vertebrae into four treatment groups: (1) kyphoplasty with CPC; (2) kyphoplasty with PMMA; (3) vertebroplasty with CPC; and (4) vertebroplasty with PMMA. Prior to injecting the cement, all vertebrae were compressed to determine their initial strength and stiffness. They were then recompressed to determine their augmented strength and stiffness. Although the augmented strength was greater than the initial strength in all groups, there was no significant difference between the two bone cements for either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. The augmented stiffness was significantly less than the initial stiffness in the kyphoplasty groups, but the difference between the two cements did not reach significance. In the vertebroplasty groups, the augmented stiffness was not significantly different from the initial stiffness. There was no significant difference between the two bone cements for either procedure when cement volume and restoration of anterior height were assessed. We concluded that kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with CPC were viable treatment alternatives to PMMA for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.},

Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric cervical spine specimens were subjected to stepwise destabilization of the C1-C3 complex, simulating a type Ⅰ Hangman fracture, type Ⅱ odontoid fracture, and the C2-3 disc injury. Intact specimens, fractured specimens, and fractured specimens with posterior, anterior fixation techniques were divided into six groups: control group (intact), injury group of type Ⅱ odontoid fracture and type Ⅰ Hangman fracture combined with C2-3 disk injury, after anterior cervical plate+ odontoid screw+ cage (ACP+ OS+ cage) group, after anterior odontoid screw plate (AOSP) fixation system group, after affixing rods from pedicle screws in C2 to lateral mass screws in C3+ odontoid screw (C2PS+ C3LMS+ OS) group, after affixing rods from pedicle screws in C1 to pedicle screws in C2 and lateral mass screws in C3 (C1PS+ C2PS+ C3LMS) group. The range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone of C1-C2 and C2-C3 segment was tested.
Results: 
There was statistically significant difference between the C1PS+ C2PS+ C3LMS fixation group and the AOSP fixation group of ROMC1-C2(P<0.05). During all loading modes, AOSP+ Bone graft fixation significantly outperformed the ACP+ OS+ cage fixation in limiting ROMC2-C3. During flexion and extension, AOSP fixation significantly outperformed the C1PS+ C2PS+ C3LMS fixation and C2PS+ C3LMS+ OS fixation in limiting ROMC2-C3.
Conclusion: 
The AOSP fixation system has excellent biomechanical performance when dealing with type Ⅰ Hangman fracture, type Ⅱ odontoid fracture, and the C2-3 disc injury, and appear to be a safe and effective technique for dealing with the combined injury.},

Controlled in vitro study.
Objective: 
To compare two kyphoplasty techniques in cadaveric fractured vertebrae: an experimental vertebral jack tool (VJT) and an inflatable bone tamp (IBT).
Summary of background data: 
A previous biomechanical study showed restored strength and stiffness after height restoration in cadaveric-fractured osteoporotic vertebrae using a new device for reduction of osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
Methods: 
Anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created in 8 (4 lumbar, 4 thoracic) vertebrae by displacement eccentric external forces. In all vertebrae the amount of height reduction was 35%. After compression, 4 vertebrae were restored in height using the VJT procedure. Four vertebrae were restored in height using the IBT procedure. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. RESULTS.: In the VJT group the post-restoration strength was 81% +/- 13% of the original strength and in the IBT group it was 96% +/- 32%. The post-restoration stiffness in the VJT group was 61% +/- 42% of the original stiffness and in the IBT group 76% +/- 62% of the original stiffness. The vertebrae in the VJT group were restored to 101% +/- 2% of their original height whereas this was 104% +/- 14% in the IBT group. In this study, no cases of cement leakage were found. No cases of damaging of the end plates, new fractures or perforations were seen in both groups. The mean amount of cement inserted for the VJT group was 3.6 +/- 0.9 cm and for the IBT group 5.9 +/- 0.8 cm.
Conclusion: 
Both kyphoplasty procedures were able to restore height in this in vitro study, while strength and stiffness were partially restored, with no significant differences. In this study on average significant less cement was used in the VJT procedure. No complications were noted in both groups. This new end plate-to-end plate laminar augmentation technique may be of clinical advantage.},

  abstract={Background: 
Although minimally invasive posterior spine implant systems have been introduced, clinical studies reported on reduced quality of spinal column realignment due to correction loss. The aim of this study was to compare biomechanically two minimally invasive spine stabilization systems versus the Universal Spine Stabilization system (USS).
Methods: 
Three groups with 5 specimens each and 2 foam bars per specimen were instrumented with USS (Group 1) or a minimally invasive posterior spine stabilization system with either polyaxial (Group 2) or monoaxial (Group 3) screws. Mechanical testing was performed under quasi-static ramp loading in axial compression and torsion, followed by destructive cyclic loading run under axial compression at constant amplitude and then with progressively increasing amplitude until construct failure. Bending construct stiffness, torsional stiffness and cycles to failure were investigated.
Results: 
Initial bending stiffness was highest in Group 3, followed by Group 2 and Group 1, without any significant differences between the groups. A significant increase in bending stiffness after 20'000 cycles was observed in Group 1 (p = 0.002) and Group 2 (p = 0.001), but not in Group 3, though the secondary bending stiffness showed no significant differences between the groups. Initial and secondary torsional stiffness was highest in Group 1, followed by Group 3 and Group 2, with significant differences between all groups (p ≤ 0.047). A significant increase in initial torsional stiffness after 20'000 cycles was observed in Group 2 (p = 0.017) and 3 (p = 0.013), but not in Group 1. The highest number of cycles to failure was detected in Group 1, followed by Group 3 and Group 2. This parameter was significantly different between Group 1 and Group 2 (p = 0.001), between Group 2 and Group 3 (p = 0.002), but not between Group 1 and Group 3.
Conclusions: 
These findings quantify the correction loss for minimally invasive spine implant systems and imply that unstable spine fractures might benefit from stabilization with conventional implants like the USS.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Cadaveric single vertebrae were used to evaluate vertebroplasty as a prophylactic treatment and as an intervention for vertebral compression fractures.
Objective: 
To investigate the biomechanical characteristics of prophylactic reinforcement and postfracture augmentation of cadaveric vertebrae.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Short-term results are promising, but longer-term studies have suggested a possible accelerated failure rate in the adjacent vertebral body. Limited research has been conducted into the effects of prophylactic vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebrae. This study aims to elucidate the biomechanical differences between the 2 treatment groups.
Methods: 
Human vertebrae were assigned to 2 scenarios: Scenario 1 simulated a wedge fracture followed by cement augmentation; Scenario 2 involved prophylactic augmentation using vertebroplasty. Micro-CT imaging was performed to assess the bone mineral density, vertebral dimensions, fracture pattern, and cement volume. All augmented specimens were then compressed under an eccentric flexion load to failure.
Results: 
Product of bone mineral density and endplate surface area gave a good prediction of failure strength when compared with actual failure strength of specimens in Scenario 1. Augmented vertebral bodies showed an average cement fill of 23.9% +/- 8.07%. There was a significant postvertebroplasty increase in failure strength by a factor of 1.72 and 1.38 in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. There was a significant reduction in stiffness following augmentation for Scenario 1 (t = 3.5, P = 0.005). Stiffness of the vertebral body in Scenario 2 was significantly greater than observed in Scenario 1 (t = 4.4, P = 0.0002).
Conclusion: 
Results suggest that augmentation of the vertebrae postfracture significantly increases failure load, while stiffness is not restored. Prophylactic augmentation was seen to increase failure strength in comparison to the predicted failure load. Stiffness appears to be maintained suggesting that prophylactic vertebroplasty maintains stiffness better than vertebroplasty postfracture.},

To compare the biomechanical stability of acetabular transverse fracture fixed with single column locking reconstruction plate, locking reconstruction plate combined with lag screw, and double columns lag screws.
Methods: 
Acetabular transverse fractures were established in 20 adult fresh semi-pelvis specimens, and divided into 5 groups randomly (n=4). The anterior columns were fixed with locking reconstruction plates in group A; the posterior columns were fixed with locking reconstruction plates in group B; the anterior columns were fixed with locking reconstruction plates and the posterior columns with lag screws in group C; the anterior columns were fixed with lag screws and the posterior columns with locking reconstruction plates in group D; the double columns were fixed with lag screws in group E. When loading three times weight, the longitudinal displacement of fracture fragment was measured, and the shear rigidity was calculated to compare the stability among groups.
Results: 
The longitudinal displacement of groups A and B were significantly greater than that of groups C, D, and E (P<0.05), and the shear rigidity of groups A and B were significantly lower than that of groups C, D, and E (P< 0.05). The longitudinal displacement of group B was significantly greater than that of group A (P< 0.05), but no significant difference was found in the shear rigidity between groups A and B (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the longitudinal displacement and shear rigiditramong groups C, D, and E (P>0.05).
Conclusion: 
Locking reconstruction plate combined with lag screw and double columns lag screws have similar stability, they have stronger stability than the single column locking reconstruction plate. The stability of anterior column locking reconstruction plate is better than that of the posterior column locking reconstruction plate.},

  abstract={Object: 
The vertebral column is the most common site for secondary bone metastases and lesions arising from hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM). These infiltrations can be lytic in nature and cause severe weakening of the vertebral body, an increased risk of fracture, and spinal cord compression leading to neurological deficit. Qualitatively it is apparent that increasing infiltration of these lytic lesions will have a deleterious effect on the mechanical behavior of the vertebrae. However, there is little quantitative information about the relationship between tumor deposits and the impact on the mechanical behavior of the vertebrae. In addition, there have been limited biomechanical assessments of the use of vertebroplasty in the management of these malignancies. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of lesion-infiltrated vertebrae from 2 malignant cancers and to investigate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty with and without tumor debulking.
Methods: 
Individual vertebrae from 2 donor spines--one with MM and another with bone metastases secondary to bladder cancer-were fractured under an eccentric flexion load, from which failure strength and stiffness were derived. Alternate vertebrae defined by spinal level were assigned to 2 groups: Group 1 involved removal of lesion material with Coblation (ArthroCare Corp.) preceding vertebroplasty; Group 2 received no Coblation prior to augmentation. All vertebrae were fractured postaugmentation under the same loading protocol. Micro-CT assessments were undertaken to investigate vertebral morphology, fracture patterns, and cement distribution.
Results: 
Multiple myeloma involvement was characterized by several small lesions, severe bone degradation, and multiple areas of vertebral shell compromise. In contrast, large focal lesions were present in the vertebrae with metastatic bladder cancer, and the shell generally remained intact. The mean initial failure strength of the vertebrae with metastases secondary to MM was significantly lower than in vertebrae with bone metastases secondary to bladder cancer (Load = 950 +/- 300 N vs 2200 +/- 750 N, p < 0.0001). A significant improvement in relative fracture strength was found postaugmentation for both lesion types (1.4 +/- 0.5, p < 0.001). Coblation provided a marginally significant increase in the same parameter postaugmentation (p = 0.08) and qualitatively improved the ease of injection and guidance of cement.
Conclusions: 
In the vertebral column, metastatic lesions secondary to bladder cancer and MM showed variations in the pattern of infiltration, both of which led to significant reductions in fracture strength. Account should be taken of these differences to optimize the vertebroplasty intervention in terms of the cement formulation, delivery, and any additional surgical procedure.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a surgical procedure that has been widely used to treat patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). The procedure involves injection of bone cement into a fractured vertebra. In this study, we investigated whether the distribution of the cement in the vertebral body is related to the occurrence of recompression after surgery.
Patients and methods: 
A total of 172 patients diagnosed with OVCF, from January 2008 to June 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty of these patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period (recompression group), and 122 patients had no recompression observed during the follow-up period (control group). Statistical analysis was performed to compare clinical and operative parameters between these two groups.
Results: 
Differences were found in bone cement distribution between the recompression group and control group (P=0.001). Patients with bone cement distributed around both upper and lower endplates had a significantly less incidence of recompression (4/50 patients), when compared to other patterns of cement distribution (eg, below upper endplate, above lower endplate, and in the middle of vertebral body). The logistic multiple regression analysis also indicated that patients with bone cement distributed around both the upper and lower endplates had a lower risk of recompression when compared to patients with bone cement distributed in the middle of vertebral body (odds ratio =0.223, P=0.003).
Conclusion: 
We herein suggest that the control of bone cement distribution during surgery provides beneficial effects on reducing the risks of recompression after PVP treatment in patients with OVCF.},

  abstract={Background: 
Burst fractures are rare in the pediatric population. There is limited information available on the best treatment for these injuries. The aims of our study were to evaluate the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI) and the potential for neurologic recovery associated with pediatric burst fractures; to compare sagittal alignment between nonoperative and operative treatment; and to determine whether functional outcomes are improved after surgery.
Methods: 
All pediatric patients who sustained thoracic or lumbar burst fractures at 2 institutions between 1991 and 2005 were identified. The medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, injury, treatment, and outcomes. Health Survey data were collected from a subset of patients in both the operative and nonoperative groups.
Results: 
Thirty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 17 male patients and 20 female patients, with an average age of 14.6 years (range, 6 to 18 y). Nine patients were treated nonoperatively and 28 patients were treated operatively. The nonoperative group was treated with hyperextension casting or bracing and showed progression of kyphotic deformity from 16.1 degrees at injury to 23.1 degrees at final follow-up. In patients treated operatively, the kyphotic deformity improved from 17.1 degrees at presentation to 7.2 degrees at final follow-up. Twenty-four patients were neurologically intact at presentation, whereas 13 presented with neurologic deficit. Six of 13 patients with SCI had some improvement. The risk of SCI was highest in patients with thoracic-level fractures. The risk of SCI did not correlate with canal compromise. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the 2 groups.
Conclusions: 
The risk of neurologic injury in pediatric burst fractures of the spine may be more closely related to the level of injury (thoracic) than the degree of spinal canal compromise. Prognosis for recovery of neurologic injury is related to the severity of the initial neurologic injury.
Level of evidence:

Primary clinical trial of limited fixation for unstable Atlas fracture.
Objectives: 
To clinically validate feasibility, safety and value of the C1 later-mass screw C2 pedicle screw and crosslink compression fixation technique.
Summary of background data: 
[corrected] In previous clinical studies, several techniques have been introduced to fix Atlas fracture. But all these treatments have intrinsic disadvantages. Now seeking a means of limited internal fixation has become a worthwhile subject of clinical study.
Materials and methods: 
From January 2001 to December 2004, 17 cases of atlas fracture were diagnosed consecutively, 11 cases were operated on with C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws and crosslink fixation, of whom 6 patents had axial instability and rupture of transverse ligament, 1 patient had C2 laminal fracture, and the remaining 4 patients had axial instability. With the assistant of regional anatomy study and fluoroscopy C1 lateral mass screws and C2 pedicle screws were implanted in place, between which connecting rods were applied bilaterally. A crosslink compression was applied between the 2 rods to achieve realignment of C1 lateral mass fracture and C0-C1-C2 into the anatomic position. C1-C2 fusion with posterior bone grafting was performed in patients with axial instability or transverse ligament discontinuity.
Results: 
Operative time ranged from 90 to 176 minutes with a mean of 124 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss ranged from 270 to 1200 mL with a mean of 432 mL. There were no neurologic deficits, vertebral artery related complications or other complications in all patients. No deterioration of the neurologic deficits was noticed 5 days after operation when the patients were brace fixed and began to ambulate. No cerebral hemodynamic deficit was observed in this patient. Radiograph examination showed bone fusion and stability in all patients 3 months after operation. Healing of C2 fracture was confirmed by computed tomography scan.
Conclusion: 
Osteosynthesis of the atlas by C1 lateral mass screws C2 pedicle screws and crosslink compression fixation is an ideal option for C1 burst fracture with or without rupture of the transverse ligament. The procedure allows for partially physiologic reconstruction of the C0-C1-C2 joint and shortens external fixation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Cervical 2 (C2) fractures in the elderly are common, and the incidence of these fractures has been increasing. Surgical and nonoperative treatments are associated with high complication and mortality rates, and these rates have not been evaluated at the population level, to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to use the Medicare claims database to determine trends in treatment, surgical and nonoperative outcomes, and Medicare reimbursement for treatment of these fractures.
Methods: 
We examined the Medicare claims database from 2000 to 2011 to identify patients admitted for the treatment of a C2 fracture. The incidence of fractures and the rates of nonoperative and surgical treatment were determined across the study period. We compared rates of mortality and life-threatening complications between patients treated nonoperatively and surgically. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) payments for the initial admission as well as for subsequent inpatient admissions during the ninety-day post-admission period were compared between treatment groups. We used multivariate analysis to control for differences in patient characteristics between groups.
Results: 
There were 81,596 admissions for C2 fracture identified, and 53,338 met inclusion criteria. The incidence of C2 fractures increased 135% from 2000 to 2011, but the rate of surgical treatment remained constant at 16%. There was significantly lower mortality at thirty days for the surgical group at 8.3% compared with the nonoperative group at 16.2% (p < 0.001) and at one year for the surgical group at 21.7% compared with the nonoperative group at 32.3% (p < 0.001). Life-threatening complications within thirty days of admission were slightly more common in the surgical group at 10.9% compared with the nonoperative group at 9.0% (p < 0.05). Medicare reimbursements for the initial inpatient admission were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in U.S. dollars for the surgical group at $21,487 compared with the nonoperative group at $8469, and this significant difference (p < 0.001) persisted in the ninety-day post-discharge period at $10,487 for the surgical group compared with $8410 for the nonoperative group.
Conclusions: 
Although the incidence of C2 fractures in the Medicare population increased from 2000 to 2011, the rate of surgery stayed relatively constant. After controlling for baseline differences, patients treated with surgery had significantly lower thirty-day and one-year mortality rates compared with patients treated nonoperatively.

Comparison of extravasations in fractured cadaver vertebrae augmented with commercial low-viscosity versus high-viscosity cements.
Objective: 
Use of high-resolution, 3-dimensional (3D) imaging to test the hypothesis that high-viscosity cements can reduce the type and severity of extravasations after vertebral augmentation procedures.
Summary of background data: 
Cement extravasations are one of the primary complications of vertebral augmentation procedures. There is some evidence that high-viscosity cements might reduce extravasations, but additional data are needed to confirm the early findings.
Methods: 
A range of vertebral fractures were created in fresh human cadavers. One group was then augmented with a low-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based cement and the other group injected with high-viscosity PMMA-based cement. High-resolution computerized tomography exams were obtained, and extravasations were assessed using 3D volume renderings. The type and severity of extravasations were recorded and analyzed.
Results: 
The proportion of vertebrae with any type of extravasation through the posterior wall to the spinal canal, into small vessels laterally or anteriorly, through the endplates, or anywhere around the body was not significantly different between the high-viscosity and low-viscosity groups. There was significantly less severe extravasation through the endplates (P=0.02), and a trend toward less severe extravasation through vessels (P=0.06) with the high versus low-viscosity cements.
Conclusions: 
In agreement with previous research, high-viscosity PMMA-based cement may help to reduce the more severe forms of extravasations after vertebral augmentation procedures in newly fractured vertebrae.},

To compare clinical and morphologic outcomes as well as follow-up fractures after kyphoplasty of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures with calcium-phosphate (CaP) cement (group 1) and with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-cement (group 2).
Summary of background data: 
CaP cements seem to be an alternative material for usage in kyphoplasty of vertebral fractures. CaP cements are biodegradable and replaceable by newly formed bone after implantation. Concerns have been raised with regard to the stability of resorbable CaP-cements after implantation into vertebrae post kyphoplasty. Calcibon is a possible CaP cement, which exhibited adequate stability in short-term observations.
Materials and methods: 
Kyphoplasty was performed in 40 consecutive patients with primary osteoporosis and painful vertebral fractures, 20 received CaP-cement, 20 were treated with PMMA-cement. All patients received a pharmacological antiosteoporosis treatment (1000 mg calcium, 1000 IU vitamin D3, and oral aminobisphosphonate), pain medication, and physiotherapy. Pain (visual analog scale [VAS]; range, 0-100), mobility (EVOS-score; range, 0-100) and radiomorphologic measurements were assessed at baseline and after 6, 12, and 36 months.
Results: 
There were no statistically significant differences between the CaP and PMMA-cement group regarding VAS-scores, EVOS-scores, or height-restoration at any time point. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of vertebral follow-up fractures between both groups during the 3-year follow-up period.
Conclusion: 
CaP cement, e.g., Calcibon, is as effective and safe as conventional PMMA-cement with regard to immediate and sustained pain reduction and improvement of mobility after kyphoplasty of patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. CaP cement has the potential of being resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone tissue; thus, it seems to be a promising alternative for PMMA also in younger patients with painful vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical outcome between posterior corpectomy, decompression and reconstruction and combined anterior-posterior surgery in the treatment of severe thoracolumbar three column fractures with incomplete paraplegia, and to provide a basis for procedure selection.
Methods: 
Clinical and radiographic results of posterior corpectomy, decompression and reconstruction (group A) and combined anterior-posterior surgery (group B) in the treatment of severe thoracolumbar three column fractures with incomplete paraplegia were analyzed retrospectively from January 2008 to December 2012. In group A, there were 18 patients (10 males and 8 females). The fractures were located on T11 in 1 case, T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 6 cases and L2 in 6 cases. In group B, there were 15 patients (9 males and 6 females). The fractures were located on T1 in 1 case, T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 5 cases and L2 in 4 cases. Neurological status was judged by Frankel grades. The X-ray and CT were used for evaluation of the restoration of anterior height of the fractured vertebral body, the correction of Cobbs angle, the decompression scope of spinal canal and the fusion. Complications related to operation were also considered. Results: The followup periods ranged from 12 to 18 months (averaged 16 months). The mean operation time, perioperative bleeding, postoperative drainage were (200 ± 43) min, (1100 ± 344) ml, and (400 ± 112) ml respectively in group A; and (290 ± 68) min, (1 500 ± 489) ml, (900 ± 269) ml respectively in group B. There was statistically significant difference between groups A and B (P < 0.05). There were significant improvements in anterior height of fractured vertebral body and Cobbs angle after operation. But there was no significant difference between groups A and B (P > 0.05). In Frankel grades, all patients had one grade or more improvement postoperatively. There was no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Treatment of thoracolumbar vertebra burst fractures with subtotal vertebrectomy, decompression and reconstruction of anterior column through posterior approach has a similar clinical result compared to the operation through combined anterior and posterior approach, but the posterior surgery decreased surgical trauma. It is an effective and safe surgical method.},

  abstract={We present a case in which rocuronium was applied for muscle relaxation following the administration of sugammadex. An emergency surgery under general anesthesia was planned for a 43-year-old male patient due to an L1 vertebral corpus and right tibia-fibula shaft fracture. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol and lidocaine. After applying only 30mg of the total induction dose of rocuronium, it was learned that the neurological examination should be controlled again from the surgeon because of the controversial of the neurological deficit. As a result, patient awakened from anesthesia. We administered 2mg/kg sugammadex and spontaneous breathing of patient returned immediately. The patient became conscious and orientated immediately afterwards. The neurological examination of the lower extremities was performed. The patient was anesthetized once again and 0.6mg/kg rocuronium was given in order to gain neoromuscular block approximately 10min after sugammadex administration. 2min later, the patient was smoothly intubated. Neuromuscular monitorization was not used because of emergency. We administered 2mg/kg sugammadex at the end of the procedure and the patient was extubated. The most suitable time for the re-establishment of rocuronium following sugammadex is currently unclear. This case showed that neuromuscular block can be effectively re-induced by rocuronium following the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex. In this case, we consider that the ability to effectively reuse normal induction doses of rocuronium is an important clinical observation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Sacroiliac screw fixation in elderly patients with pelvic fractures is prone to failure owing to impaired bone quality. Cement augmentation has been proposed as a possible solution, because in other anatomic areas this has been shown to reduce screw loosening. However, to our knowledge, this has not been evaluated for sacroiliac screws.
Questions::Purposes: 
We investigated the potential biomechanical benefit of cement augmentation of sacroiliac screw fixation in a cadaver model of osteoporotic bone, specifically with respect to screw loosening, construct survival, and fracture-site motion.
Methods: 
Standardized complete sacral ala fractures with intact posterior ligaments in combination with ipsilateral upper and lower pubic rami fractures were created in osteoporotic cadaver pelves and stabilized by three fixation techniques: sacroiliac (n = 5) with sacroiliac screws in S1 and S2, cemented (n = 5) with addition of cement augmentation, and transsacral (n = 5) with a single transsacral screw in S1. A cyclic loading protocol was applied with torque (1.5 Nm) and increasing axial force (250-750 N). Screw loosening, construct survival, and sacral fracture-site motion were measured by optoelectric motion tracking. A sample-size calculation revealed five samples per group to be required to achieve a power of 0.80 to detect 50% reduction in screw loosening.
Results: 
Screw motion in relation to the sacrum during loading with 250 N/1.5 Nm was not different among the three groups (sacroiliac: 1.2 mm, range, 0.6-1.9; cemented: 0.7 mm, range, 0.5-1.3; transsacral: 1.1 mm, range, 0.6-2.3) (p = 0.940). Screw subsidence was less in the cemented group (3.0 mm, range, 1.2-3.7) compared with the sacroiliac (5.7 mm, range, 4.7-10.4) or transsacral group (5.6 mm, range, 3.8-10.5) (p = 0.031). There was no difference with the numbers available in the median number of cycles needed until failure; this was 2921 cycles (range, 2586-5450) in the cemented group, 2570 cycles (range, 2500-5107) for the sacroiliac specimens, and 2578 cycles (range, 2540-2623) in the transsacral group (p = 0.153). The cemented group absorbed more energy before failure (8.2 × 105 N*cycles; range, 6.6 × 105-22.6 × 105) compared with the transsacral group (6.5 × 105 N*cycles; range, 6.4 × 105-6.7 × 105) (p = 0.016). There was no difference with the numbers available in terms of fracture site motion (sacroiliac: 2.9 mm, range, 0.7-5.4; cemented: 1.2 mm, range, 0.6-1.9; transsacral: 2.1 mm, range, 1.2-4.8). Probability values for all between-group comparisons were greater than 0.05.
Conclusions: 
The addition of cement to standard sacroiliac screw fixation seemed to change the mode and dynamics of failure in this cadaveric mechanical model. Although no advantages to cement were observed in terms of screw motion or cycles to failure among the different constructs, a cemented, two-screw sacroiliac screw construct resulted in less screw subsidence and greater energy absorbed to failure than an uncemented single transsacral screw.
Clinical relevance: 
In osteoporotic bone, the addition of cement to sacroiliac screw fixation might improve screw anchorage. However, larger mechanical studies using these findings as pilot data should be performed before applying these preliminary findings clinically.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Review of human cadaveric and in vivo animal studies and clinical trial.
Objective: 
To develop less invasive surgical techniques for reconstruction of the anterior column in thoracolumbar fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Persistent central endplate depression can cause anterior column insufficiency after posterior surgery for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Reduction of the central endplate followed by intravertebral cement augmentation could restore weight-bearing capacity.
Materials and methods: 
In human cadaveric burst fracture models, balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and vertebroplasty techniques have been investigated in terms of their safety and biomechanical properties. The histologic properties of different cement polymers were studied in an animal vertebral body and endplate defect model. In addition, the clinical outcome of percutaneous cement augmentation in the setting of a burst fracture examining the BAER technique and vertebroplasty with adjunctive posterior pedicle screw fixation is reviewed.
Results: 
These techniques have proven to be safe and effective, although cement leakage outside the confines of the vertebral body may occur. Calcium phosphate cements are preferable over methylmethacrylate because of their in vivo histologic properties. Using the BAER technique and posterior pedicular fixation, anterior vertebral height restoration is possible. Following balloon removal, some loss of fracture height restoration is observed. Further loss of vertebral height reduction was not observed following cement curing clinically.
Conclusions: 
These studies show that less invasive anterior vertebral reconstruction using percutaneous cement augmentation techniques is feasible following traumatic vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate cement leakage (CL) in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with cortical defect using high-viscosity bone cement during unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) surgery.This study included a series of 77 patients (23 males, 54 females) with single level osteoporotic vertebral body fracture (OVCF) who underwent unilateral PKP in our hospital. Preoperative x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and 3-dimensional reconstructions were studied. During the PKP procedure, needle was carefully put to avoid too near to the cortical defect according to CT image. High-viscosity bone cement was used via unilateral PKP. Radiographic outcomes were evaluated by assessment of vertebral body wall breakage, fracture type, and vertebral body change. The exact rate of CL was analyzed.A total of 77 patients with single-level OVCF were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 74.8 ± 8.0 years. Among these cases, 7 (9.1%) involved the thoracic spine (T3-T10), 60 (77.9%) involved the thoracolumbar spine (T10-L2), and 10 (13.0%) involved the lumbar spine (L3-L5). There were 27 vertebral bodies found posterior wall breakage, 51 vertebral bodies found endplate breakage, and 49 vertebral bodies found anterior-lateral wall breakage. CT scan was more efficient in detecting vertebral body wall breakage and CL than x-ray (P < .001). No neurological symptoms were found after surgery. Both cases with CL (CL group) and cases without cement leakage (NCL group) experienced vertebral height restoration (HR) with similar cement volume CV. There were no significant difference between the two groups about the parameter HR and CV. Severe vertebral body fracture and biconcave fracture had more CL than other groups. OVCF cases with cortical defect had more CL rate than those without cortical defect; however, no significant difference was found in the correlation between vertebral wall breakage and CL.Cortical defect remains a potential risk of CL during PKP surgery. Careful preoperative evaluation and using high-viscosity bone cement during the unilateral PKP procedure could prevent serious leakage and clinical symptoms.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the influencing factors of cement leakage in vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) and vertebral metastases (VM).
Methods: 
Retrospective analysis was conducted for 653 vertebrae in 356 patients undergoing vertebroplasty at our hospital from May 2007 to January 2011. 251 cases had 438 vertebrae with painful OVCF while 105 cases had 215 vertebrae with VM. Pre-operative computed tomography (CT) was performed to determine the presence of cortical defects or osteolysis and within 3 days after PVP to observe the distribution of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in vertebrae and whether leakage occurred. Volume of PMMA injected into each vertebral body and types of cement leakage were compared between the OVCF and VM groups by Z test or χ². The correlation between cortical defects and cement leakages around vertebrae was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient.
Results: 
The successful rate of PVP was 100%. The mean volume of PMMA injected into each vertebra was (5.0 ± 2.0) ml and (4.0 ± 1.7) ml in the OVCF and VM groups respectively (P < 0.05). Asymptomatic PMMA leakage was demonstrated by CT in 93 vertebrae (21.2%) in the OVCF group and in 53 vertebrae (28.8%) in the VM group respectively (P < 0.05). Cement leakages into disk were found in 58 vertebrae in the OVCF group and 16 vertebrae in the VM group respectively (P = 0.025). Cement leakages into paravertebral vein were found in 12 vertebrae in the OVCF group and 26 vertebrae in the VM group respectively (P < 0.0001). Correlation was found between cortical defects and cement leakage into paravertebral soft tissues in the OVCF group (r = 0.14) or in the VM group (r = 0.27), between end-plate defects and cement leakage into disk in the OVCF group (r = 0.29) or in the VM group (r = 0.31).
Conclusion: 
As a common occurrence in vertebroplasty, cement extravasation is well-tolerated in most patients. It occurs more frequently in the patients with VM than those with OVCF, especially in cases of leakage into paravertebral vein. Cement leakage into disc or paravertebral soft tissue is predisposed in vertebrae with end plate, cortical defects or osteolysis.},

To evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, we compared the pre- and postoperative clinical and radiological results in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty.
Introduction: 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. We compared the pre- and postoperative compression ratios (CRs), kyphotic angles (KAs), and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the patients in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The results showed that the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is a therapeutic option for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Due to the relatively high-risk nature of the patient population, complications such as myocardial events, seizures, agitation, or dyspnea may occur and render completion of the procedure imprudent. We analyzed the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients who underwent balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs between January 2005 and April 2008. A unipedicular approach was used in 15 patients and a bipedicular approach was used in 30 patients. The CR, KA, and 100-point VAS score for pain were measured pre- and postoperatively in each patient.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in restoration of the CR (p = 0.376) and KA (p = 0.888) between the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The patients in the unipedicular group showed greater improvement in VAS score than those in the bipedicular group (p < 0.001). There were no postoperative complications, such as nerve injury or pedicle fracture, in either of the two groups.
Conclusion: 
The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs were as good as those of bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. Thus, unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with VCFs.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the differences between advanced percutaneous vertebroplasty and routine percutaneous vertebroplasty,and evaluate the clinical application of advanced percutaneous vertebroplasty in treating senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.
Methods: 
From January 2010 to January 2011,28 patients with senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were concealed random allocated to advanced percutaneous vertebroplasty and routine percutaneous vertebroplasty group according to whether using advanced percutaneous pedicle puncture. Of them,there were 5 males and 23 females with an average age of (70.50 +/- 9.33) years old (ranged, 53 to 85). Course of disease was from 2 to 28 days with an average of (7.62 +/- 4.52). The fracture involved 34 vertebral bodies (19 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 15 segments of lumbar vertebra), 3 day's antibiotics were applied to prevent infections. The opreation time, X-ray fluoroscopy times were compared, and pain relief effect were evaluated by VAS (visual analogue scales) score.
Results: 
For operation time, there were significant meaning between routine group (49.00 +/- 7.74) min and advanced group (32.36 +/- 4.81) min (t = 6.828,P = 0.000 < 0.05); X-ray fluoroscopy times in advanced group (4.28 +/- 1.38) times was shorter than routine group (8.78 +/- 2.33) times, and had statistical significance (t = 6.222, P = 0.000 < 0.05); while there were no meaning in VAS scores between routine group (2.85 +/- 0.94) and advanced group (2.57 +/- 1.08) (t = 0.740, P = 0.456 > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Compared with routine group, advanced group can shorten opreration time, reduce radiological hazard, further reduce image monitoring costs and surgical risk, and benefit from the application of advanced percutaneous vertebroplasty in treating senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Furthmore, it can provide reference to vertebral body biopsy and minimally invasive of pedicle screw fixation.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Comparative, prospective follow-up study.
Objective: 
Comparison of outcome between patients treated with Percutaneous VertebroPlasty (PVP) using low and medium viscosity PolyMethylMetAcrylate (PMMA) bone cement.
Summary of background data: 
Viscosity is the characterizing parameter of PMMA bone cement, currently the standard augmentation material in PVP, and influences interdigitation, cement distribution inside the vertebral body, injected volume and extravasation, thereby affecting the clinical outcome of PVP. Currently, low, medium, and high viscosity PMMA bone cements are used interchangeably. However, effect of viscosity on clinical outcome in patients with Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures (OVCFs) has not yet been explicit subject of investigation.
Methods: 
Follow-up was conducted using a 0 to 10 Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Quality of Life questionnaire before PVP and at 7 days (PI-NRS only), 1, 3, and 12 months after PVP. Injected cement volume, degree of interdigitation, and cement leakage were analyzed on direct postoperative computed tomography scanning. At 6 and 52 weeks and at suspicion, patients were analyzed for new fractures.
Results: 
A total of 30 consecutive patients received PVP using low viscosity PMMA bone cement (OsteoPal-V) for 62 OVCFs, followed by 34 patients who received PVP using medium viscosity PMMA bone cement (Disc-O-Tech) for 67 OVCFs. Results regarding PI-NRS and SF-36 were comparable between both groups. Postoperative comparison of injected cement volume, degree of interdigitation, proportion of bipedicular procedures, incidence of new vertebral fractures and complications revealed no differences between both groups. Viscosity was identified as a risk factor for the occurrence of cement leakage (yes/no, OR: 2.925, 95% confidence interval: [1.072-7.984], P = 0.036).
Conclusion: 
No major differences in clinical outcome after PVP in OVCFs using low and medium viscosity PMMA bone cement were found. Viscosity of PMMA bone cement was identified as an independent predictor of cement leakage.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are a frequent occurrence in geriatric traumatology. Differences in the achievement of pain reduction and restoration of the height of the vertebral body after balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) or radiofrequency-targeted vertebral augmentation (RF-TVA) were to be tested on a randomized population.
Methods: 
A total of 80 patients (f = 59; m = 21) with osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies were assigned to the groups BKP (n = 44) or RF-TVA (n = 36). The clinical analyses were compared peri- and postoperatively in a prospective study with an additional follow-up examination after 1 year.
Results: 
The operations for BKP were bipedicular in all cases; for RF-TVA, a bipedicular access was required in only five cases (14 %) (p>0.0001). There were confirmed differences with respect to the amount of cement used (ml) between the two groups (BKP = 4.9 ± 1 vs. RFTVA= 3.4 ± 1; p<0.001). In the BKP group, the angle of kyphosis was reduced by an average of 1.65° and in the RF-TVA group by an average of 2.8° by the operation. The analysis of the maximum VAS data showed a clear postoperative reduction in the intensity of pain of approximately 4.5 cm in each of the groups with no discernible difference. After 12 months, the majority of patients in both groups (BKP = 61 % vs. RF-TVA = 83 %) reported being free of pain when at rest without a significant difference(p = 0.05).
Conclusions: 
A certain superiority of RF-TVA with respect to pain relief, amount of cement required, savings of operating time and personnel, and greater safety with respect to cement leakage noted in this study are consistent with other published literature. The differences between the two methods in the frequency of subsequent postoperative fractures and the secondary loss of high restoration were encouraging regarding RF-TVA.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the effect of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP) and mouse nerve growth factor (mNGF) for injection in treating acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) and cauda equina injury.
Methods: 
Between December 2004 and December 2007, 43 patients with ASCI and cauda equina injury were treated, including 33 males and 10 females with an average age of 43 years (range, 32-66 years). Injured vertebral columns were C2 in 1 case, C4 in 5 cases, C5 in 7 cases, C6 in 3 cases, T8 in 1 case, T10 in 1 case, T11 in 2 cases, T12 in 3 cases, L1 in 9 cases, L2 in 5 cases, L3 in 3 cases, L4 in 1 case, and L5 in 2 cases. All the patients had sensory disturbance and motor dysfunction at admission. The Frankel scale was used for assessment of nerve function, 5 cases were rated as Grade A, 12 as Grade B, 22 as Grade C, and 4 as Grade D before operation. In 43 patients, 23 cases were treated with MP and mNGF (group A), 20 cases with MP only (group B). There was no significant difference in general data between 2 groups (P > 0.05). All the patients were admitted, received drug treatment within 8 hours of injury, and were given spinal canal decompression, bone transplantation, and internal fixation within 48 hours. The neurological function score systems of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) were used for neurological scores before treatment, at 1 week and 2 years after treatment. The scores of the activity of daily living (ADL) were evaluated and compared.
Results: 
All the patients achieved healing of incision by first intention. Forty-three cases were followed up 24-61 months with an average of 30 months. Bone graft fusion was achieved after 6-17 months, 11 months on average with stable fixation. No death and complications of osteonecrosis and central obesity occurred. There was no significant difference in neurological function scores and ADL scores between 2 groups before treatment (P > 0.05); however, the neurological function scores and ADL scores at 1 week and 2 years after treatment were higher than those before treatment (P < 0.01) in 2 groups. Group A had higher neurological function scores and ADL scores than group B (P < 0.01). At 1 week and 2 years after treatment, the improvement rates of neurological function of group A (47.8%, 11/23 and 91.3%, 21/23) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those of group B (30.0%, 6/20 and 70.0%, 14/20).
Conclusion: 
MP and mNGF play an important role in improving the neurological function in patients with ASCI and cauda equina injury.},

We report our experience for 81 kyphoplasty procedures performed in 45 patients with thoracic and lumbar vertebral lesions caused by metastases. 4 out of the 45 patients were withdrawn at 1-year follow-up. 41 patients demonstrated good clinical result. The osteoblastic group performed a better pain relief in visual analog scale (VAS) score after the treatment than the osteoclastic group 3 days, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after the KP. And the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores of the osteoblastic group is lower than that of the osteoclastic group just in 3 days after the KP. And there were no significant difference between the two groups of ODI scores 1 month, 3 month and 1 year after the KP. And there were no statistical differences of the radiographic parameters including VB height variation and local kyphosis angle (LKA) between the two groups. Kyphoplasty results in an effective, minimally invasive procedure for the stabilization of thoracic and lumbar metastatic vertebral lesions, including both osteoblastic and osteoclastic types, which achieves statistically significant pain relief, function improvement, preventing further local kyphotic deformity, and VB height.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To determine the association between fluid sign and clinical prognosis following percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV).
Materials and methods: 
Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this prospective study. Fifty-two patients (41 women, 11 men; mean age, 75.9 years; range, 56-95 years) were enrolled from August 2006 to August 2007. All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and assessment of mobility and pain scores. PV was performed and patients underwent 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up examinations. MR findings of fluid sign (a focal, linear, or triangular area of strong hyperintensity, which is isointense relative to cerebrospinal fluid on T2-weighted sagittal images) and vacuum cleft were analyzed with respect to clinical outcome. Data were analyzed by using a combination of independent Student t test, chi(2) test, analysis of variance, and Fisher exact test.
Results: 
Thirty-four (65%) patients showed vacuum cleft; 14 (27%) showed fluid sign at the bone-cement interface. Patients without fluid sign in the treated vertebral bodies had better mobility and pain improvement compared with patients with fluid sign at 1- and 3-month follow-up (P < .05). The adjacent fracture percentage (seven of 14, 50%) was higher in patients with fluid sign in the treated vertebral bodies than in those without (three of 38, 8%) (P = .002). Pain was similar in groups with and without fluid sign at 6-month follow-up.
Conclusion: 
The fluid sign in the treated vertebral bodies had a high negative predictive value of 92% and a positive predictive value of 50% to develop a new adjacent compression fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are emerging procedures for almost immediate pain relief when treating osteoporotic or osteolytic fractures. The main reported complication is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leakage, which may lead to compression of neural structures or embolism. Different authors have proposed that intravertebral pressure (IP) is an important factor determining the risk for leakage, although so far only limited information has been gathered from clinical and experimental studies. There is also a lack of understanding of the IP during conventional interventions in VP and KP in the clinic.
Objective: 
(1) To compare the intravertebral pressures of compressed vertebrae and adjacent normal vertebrae. (2) To measure the IP of compressed vertebrae during VP and KP.
Setting: 
An interventional pain management practice, a medical center, major metropolitan city, in the People's Republic of China.
Methods: 
Thirty-five patients (with 40 compressed vertebrae and 35 adjacent normal vertebrae) were randomly allocated for intravertebral pressure measurements. Cannulas were placed bipedicularly into the posterior third of each vertebral body. Either PMMA or a balloon was injected into the vertebral body through the right cannula. A manometer was connected to the cannula in the left pedicle, and heparin was injected to verify the pressure measurement system.
Results: 
The range (minimum-maximum), average IP, and the standard deviation of the compressed vertebrae were 0-39 mm Hg and 24.5 ±11.3 mm Hg; and that of adjacent normal vertebrae were 3-16 mm Hg, 7.3 ± 4.2 mm Hg. Furthermore, the average IP for Phase 1 (before PMMA injection) for VP was 23 ±11.9 mm Hg; the maximum IP recorded during injection was 169 ± 46.8 mm Hg and the IP for 10 minutes after injection was 33 ±9.4 mm Hg. Meanwhile, the highest IP recorded for KP patients was 142 ±39.6 mm Hg. The average IP for Phase 1 (before balloon inflation) was 24 ±12.7 mmHg; Phase 2 (peak IP during the balloon inflation) was 63 ± 25.8 mm Hg; and Phase 3 (after balloon inflation/before PMMA injection) was , and 18 ± 10.8 mm Hg. The IP for 10 minutes after injection in KP patients was 36 ± 8.5 mm Hg.
Limitations: 
The flow rate was manually controlled, which is in line with clinical routine, and was kept at approximately 0.1 mL/s. Because the speed of injection was controlled by hand, an exact injection rate could not be assured, leading to some inaccuracy when comparing the IP of VP and KP patients. Each patient was injected with a different PMMA volume. Because PMMA injection was performed to a satisfactory vertebral body filling and limited by any signs of extravasation, it was difficult to maintain a constant injection volume, unlike in vitro studies. Other factors such as the damage to the vertebral shell or the degree of osteoporosis might also have affected the intravertebral pressure.
Conclusion: 
This study showed that the IP of compressed vertebrae was significantly higher than that of adjacent normal vertebrae. There was a significant increase in IP during the PMMA filling in VP and KP; the IP of compressed vertebrae was not significantly reduced by the balloon inflation in KP, and no statistically significant differences in IP were found during all common stages of PMMA filling in VP and KP.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To analyze the clinical outcomes of percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anesthesia for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
In this study, 76 elderly patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures undergoing percutaneous kyphoplasty were followed up for 2-3.1 years. They were divided into 3 groups according to different ages: 60-69 yrs (A group), 70-79 yrs (B group) and 80- 91 yrs (C group). Pre- and post-operative and last follow-up evaluations were conducted. And the parameters of bone mineral density (BMD), kyphotic angle, change of visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index, average vertebral body height, complications and costs of hospitalization were recorded and analyzed.
Results: 
BMD decreased with advancing age and had statistical significance between three groups (P < 0.05). Three thoracic spine fractures and 6 lumbar spine fractures could not be detected with digital radiography and were observed only on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pre-operative levels of visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index increased in all groups.No statistical significance existed between A and B groups. But there was statistical significance between A or B and C groups (P < 0.05). Pre- and post-operative assessments showed that statistically significant improvements were found in visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index in all groups (P < 0.05). And statistically significant improvements were found for the pre- and post-operative kyphotic angles and vertebral body heights in A, C group and B groups (P < 0.05). The sites for symptomatic leakage of cement included paravertebral vein (n = 2), intervertebral disc (n = 1) and paravertebral space (n = 2). Adjacent vertebral fracture occurred in 1 patient at 17 months and underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty. The mean operative duration was 28 minutes per vertebrae and the mean cost of hospitalization at RMB yuan 33 778.
Conclusion: 
As a simple and safe procedure for osteoporotic vertebrae compression fractures, percutaneous kyphoplasty may relieve pain quickly, restore vertebral height, prevent further fractures and improve the patient's quality-of-life.},

  abstract={In this open prospective trial, 53 patients with acute pain from osteoporotic vertebral fracture related to osteoporosis or malignancy underwent vertebral augmentation with a new bisphenol-a-glycidyl dimethacrylate (bis-GMA) resin (Cortoss, Orthovita, Malvern, Pa, USA). Treatment consisted of up to 8 ml of Cortoss injected into a given vertebra. The procedure encompassed single and multiple injections (including the contralateral hemivertebra, to a maximum of 3 vertebral levels). Follow-up was at 4 and 8 days and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary efficacy end point was patient-rated pain using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS, with 100 as severest pain) on day 4 following treatment; secondary end points were analgesic use and quality-of-life and disability scores from the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and a short-form 12-item questionnaire (SF-12). The present report contains interim results collected up to the 1-month post-treatment time point. At baseline, the group's mean VAS score was 69, indicating moderate to severe pain; at day 4, 32 of 53 patients (60.4%) reported a 30% or greater reduction in baseline pain accompanied by a VAS pain score less than 50 (mean 38.1). Pain reduction was maintained at 1 month (mean VAS 31.3). The average ODI score at baseline was 55, suggesting significant disability among participants prior to Cortoss treatment. Following treatment, the ODI scores were significantly reduced from these baseline levels (day 8, 47.4; 1 month, 33.6). Further, SF-12 physical and mental component scores at 1 month after treatment increased from baseline by 26% and 11%, respectively; while analgesic use decreased concomitantly, primarily among patients with underlying osteoporosis. A total of 20 adverse events were deemed to be device-related. The most frequent clinically significant adverse events attributed to Cortoss were leakage of Cortoss from within the vertebral body at placement (12%), back pain (7%), and unspecified pain (7%). These results indicate that vertebral augmentation with Cortoss rapidly reduces pain, decreases disability, and improves physical functioning in patients with painful vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Aim: 
This study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of     surgical approaches in type II odontoid fracture.
Material and methods: 
In a     retrospective study in Mashhad university, 15 patients with anterior screw     fixation technique (ASF) and 31 patients with posterior approaches (PA) were     reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, length of hospital stay,     operation time, injury severity score (ISS), Preinjury Charlson comorbidity     index, fusion rate and surgical complications were analyzed in these two groups.
Results: 
Neck pain was the most common clinical presentation in these two groups     (89.7%). There were no significant differences in ISS and mean length of     hospital stay and Comorbidity index between the two groups. The operation time     was different between these two groups (65 minutes in ASF versus118 minutes in     PA, P < 0.05). Bone union was documented in 13 patients (87%) with ASF and 28     patients (90%) with PA.
Conclusion: 
The outcome of surgery with anterior or     posterior approach in the patients are potential candidates for surgery is good.     In our patients, the operation time is different in the two groups but     differences in fusion rate, length of hospital stay, comorbidity index and     postsurgical complications are not considerable.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective clinical study was used to evaluate the effect of a new surgical treatment of the hangman's fractures.
Objective: 
To determine the treatment efficacy of combined anterior C2-C3 reduction and fusion and posterior compressive C2 pedicle screw fixation for the management of unstable hangman's fractures.
Summary of background data: 
The classification of hangman's fractures as proposed by Levine-Edwards was used to classify and guide the treatment of these injuries. Most of these fractures respond to a variety of conservative therapies, but recently, earlier surgery has been increasingly advocated by authors from several countries for the rapid stabilization of these fractures. If surgery is indicated, an anterior approach using a C2-C3 reduction and fusion is preferred usually. Another well-accepted surgical method is the direct transpedicular osteosynthesis by the dorsal approach. However, there was rare report of the combined use of these 2 techniques.
Methods: 
A group of 45 surgical patients were all diagnosed with radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 3D CT scans. Initial and final radiographs were measured for anterior translation and angulation of the C2-C3 complex. Initial external skull traction with extension was used in all patients after admission to reduce the fracture. Then an anterior C2-C3 discectomy followed by an interbody fusion and locking plate fixation was performed. Intraoperative reduction was confirmed by fluoroscopic control. About 29 patients therefore received anterior surgeries only since satisfactory reduction was achieved during the procedure. For the 16 patients who had persistent large residual gaps after the anterior procedure, additional same stage posterior C2 compressive pedicle screws were placed. Clinical and radiologic comparisons were performed in these 2 groups.
Results: 
The follow-up ranged from 24 to 54 months, with an average 33.6 months. There was radiographic evidence of continuity of the fracture and the bone graft seen at 4.7 months on average. Neck pain and neurologic deficits resolved in nearly all patients after surgery. The anterior translation of anterior-posterior surgery group decreased more significant compared to anterior surgery group, although with no statistical significance. The fractures were closed with a slight gap no more than 2 mm in anterior-posterior surgery group. The residual kyphosis in anterior-posterior surgery group was still a little larger than it in anterior surgery group. No internal fixation failures or infections were observed.
Conclusion: 
We believe that the need for single stage 360° fusion of hangman's fractures can be somewhat predicted by a combination of high resolution imaging. For hangman's fractures with significant deformity and gapping, it is our experience that immediate single-stage anterior-posterior reduction, instrumentation, and arthrodesis achieve superior postoperative reduction and long-term functional outcomes.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective clinical study.
Objective: 
To compare long-term radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing anterior odontoid screw placement using traditional biplanar fluoroscopy or isocentric 3-dimensional C-arm (iso-C) fluoroscopy-assisted techniques.
Summary of background data: 
Anterior screw fixation of odontoid fractures preserves motion at the C1-C2 joint, but accurate screw positioning is essential for successful outcomes. Biplanar fluoroscopy image guidance is most often used; however, iso-C imaging improves the ease and accuracy of screw placement with less radiation exposure.
Methods: 
Fifty-one patients underwent anterior odontoid screw fixation for type II (48 patients) and rostral type III fractures (3 patients). Procedures were guided by biplanar fluoroscopy in 25 (49%) patients, and with iso-C assistance in 26 (51%). Length of surgery, complications, and clinical outcomes based on the Smiley-Webster score were evaluated. Computed tomography confirmed adequate screw placement. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 9 months.
Results: 
At 3-month follow-up, screw position and fusion across the fracture were evident in 87% of the cases treated with biplanar fluoroscopy and in 100% treated by iso-C. The average outcome score in the iso-C group was superior to that of the biplanar group (1.08 vs. 1.33, respectively), although not statistically significant. At last follow-up, the rate of successful fusion was 88% in the biplanar group and 95% in the iso-C group. Length of surgery was significantly lower in the iso-C group compared with the biplanar group (P=0.05). The significantly longer preparation time in the iso-C group (P=0.04) accounted for no overall difference in total operating room occupancy time between the 2 groups.
Conclusions: 
Iso-C significantly decreased surgical time. At last follow-up iso-C assistance was associated with improved rates of radiographic fusion with comparable outcome and complication profiles. This series represents the largest cohort of patients treated with intraoperative real-time navigation assistance for odontoid fractures.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
The authors present a new titanium implant for replacement of the vertebral body (Synex). Possible indications would be fractures or dislocations with destruction of the anterior column, posttraumatic kyphosis as well as tumors in the throracolumbar spine. The construction has to be completed by a stabilizing implant. For best fit and contact to adjacent end-plates Synex is distractable in situ. The possibility of secondary dislocation or loss of correction should thereby be minimised.
Objectives: 
We performed comparative compression tests with Synex and MOSS ("Harms mesh cage") on human cadaveric specimens of intact vertebrae (L1). The aim of the study was to measure the compressive strength of the vertebral body end-plate in uniaxial loading via both implants to exclude a caving of Synex in vivo.
Methods: 
12 human cadaveric specimens of intact vertebrae (L1) were divided in 2 similar groups (matched pairs) according to bone mineral density (BMD), determined using DE-QCT. The specimens were loaded with axial compression force at a constant speed of 5 mm/min to failure and the displacement was recorded with a continuous load-displacement curve.
Results: 
The mean ultimate compression force (Fmax) showed a tendency towards a higher result testing Synex with 3396 N versus 2719 N (non significant). The displacement until Fmax was 2.9 mm in group S (Synex), which was half as long as in group M (5.8 mm). The difference was significant (p < 0.001). The compression force was twice as high and significantly (p < 0.05) higher with Synex at a displacement of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm. A significant (p < 0.001) correlation (R = 0.89) between Fmax and BMD was found.
Conclusions: 
Synex was found to be at least comparable to MOSS for suspensory replacement of the vertebral body at the thoracolumbar spine. A possible consequence of the significantly higher mean compression forces between 1 and 2 mm displacement might be a decreased segmental deformation or loss of correction.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of surgical and medical therapies on recurrent vertebral fracture and mortality rates.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of medical records was performed of patients seen at Emory University Spine Center and Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia) for vertebral fracture between 1998 and 2007. Patients with vertebral fracture or who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty were identified by use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes, respectively. Outcome measures included site and date of recurrent vertebral fractures and mortality.
Results: 
We identified 250 patients with vertebral fractures and classified them into 4 groups: surgical therapy only, surgical plus medical treatment, medical therapy only, and no treatment. There was no significant difference in the cumulative survival rates among the 4 study groups nor between the treatment groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the cumulative refracture-free rates among the 4 study groups (P<.0001). Recurrent fracture-free rates were highest in the group that received no treatment. The 2-year cumulative refracture-free rates were 95.9%, 84.8%, 81.7%, and 68.5%, respectively, for the no treatment, medical therapy only, surgical treatment only, and medical plus surgical therapy groups. Recurrent fracture-free rates were significantly different for patients who received surgical or medical or surgical plus medical therapy (P=.0007), with patients in the medical plus surgical group having the shortest time to refracture, although these patients may have been sicker and more frail than the other groups.
Conclusion: 
We found that surgical treatment with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty did not decrease recurrent vertebral fractures in patients presenting with an initial vertebral fracture. Medical and surgical therapies together may shorten the time to refracture, but the observed elevated risk may be due to other confounding factors. We found no difference in survival in patients undergoing kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in comparison with medical or no treatment groups. The relationship between surgical and medical therapy and vertebral refracture rates should be further evaluated with use of a prospective cohort design.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the surgical efficacy of different operating methods for treating old thoracolumbar fracture with spinal cord injury.
Methods: 
From September 2000 to March 2006, 34 cases of old thoracolumbar fractures with spinal cord injury were treated. Patients were divided into 2 groups randomly. Group A (n = 18): anterior approach osteotomy, iliac bone graft and internal fixation were used. There were 10 males and 8 females with the age of 17-54 years. The apex level of kyphosis was T11 in 2 cases, T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 8 cases and L2 in 3 cases. The average preoperative Cobb angle of kyphosis was (36.33 +/- 3.13) degrees, and the average preoperative difference in height between anterior and posterior of involved vertebra was (22.34 +/- 11.61) mm. Neurological dysfunction JOA score was 10.44 +/- 1.12. Group B (n = 16): transpedicular posterior decompression and internal fixation were used. There were 8 males and 8 females with the age of 18-56 years. The apex level of kyphosis was T11 in 2 cases, T12 in 6 cases, L1 in 7 cases and L2 in 1 case. The preoperative Cobb angle of kyphosis was (38.55 +/- 4.22) degrees, and the preoperative difference in height between anterior and posterior of involved vertebra was (20.61 +/- 10.22) mm. Neurological dysfunction JOA score was 10.23 +/- 2.23.
Results: 
All the patients were followed up for 9-46 months with an average of 13.5 months. Cobb angle was (12.78 +/- 3.76) degrees in group A, which was improved by (24.23 +/- 1.64) degrees compared to that of preoperation; and was (10.56 +/- 4.23)degrees in group B, which was improved by (26.66 +/- 1.66) degrees. JOA score was 14.21 +/- 1.08 in group A, which was improved by 3.92 +/- 1.33; and it was 13.14 +/- 2.32 in group B, which was improved by 3.12 +/- 1.95. The average postoperative difference between anterior height and posterior height of vertebral body in group A was (3.11 +/- 1.06) mm, which was improved by (18.03 +/- 2.14) mm; and it was (2.56 +/- 1.33) mm in group B, which was corrected by (20.36 +/- 3.78) mm. There were statistically significant differences in the above indexes between preoperation and postoperation in 2 groups (P < 0.01), but no significant differences between 2 groups (P > 0.05). In group A, pleural effusion occurred in 2 cases and local pulmonary collapse in 4 cases and intercostals neuralgia in 1 case. In group B, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid occurred in 3 cases.
Conclusion: 
Both anterior and posterior approach are capable of treating of the old thoracolumbar fracture with incomplete spinal cord injury and providing the satisfying result of deformation correction, neurological decompression and neurological functional recovery to a certain extent.},

From June 2010 to August 2013, 98 cases of OVCFs were included in our study. Forty-six patients underwent high-viscosity PVP and 52 patients underwent low-viscosity PKP. The occurrence of cement leakage was observed. Pain relief and functional activity were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), respectively. Restoration of the vertebral body height and angle of kyphosis were assessed by comparing preoperative and postoperative measurements of the anterior heights, middle heights and the kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra. Nine out of the 54 vertebra bodies and 11 out of the 60 vertebra bodies were observed to have cement leakage in the high-viscosity PVP and low-viscosity PKP groups, respectively. The rate of cement leakage, correction of anterior vertebral height and kyphotic angles showed no significant differences between the two groups (P>0.05). Low-viscosity PKP had significant advantage in terms of the restoration of middle vertebral height as compared with the high-viscosity PVP (P<0.05). Both groups showed significant improvements in pain relief and functional capacity status after surgery (P<0.05). It was concluded that high-viscosity PVP and low-viscosity PKP have similar clinical effects in terms of the rate of cement leakage, restoration of the anterior vertebral body height, changes of kyphotic angles, functional activity, and pain relief. Low-viscosity PKP is better than high-viscosity PVP in restoring the height of the middle vertebra.},

  abstract={The present study aimed at examining the curative effect of modified posterior operation on treatment of Kümmell's disease. About 30 patients of Kümmell's disease with complete image and clinical data treated during June 2004 to July 2013 were conducted with anterior and posterior approaches, respectively. Kyphotic Cobb angle, fractured vertebra wedge angle, and the anterior and posterior heights of fractured vertebra were all measured through x-ray before and after operation, and the pain visual analog scale (VAS) was determined for evaluating the effect of operations. The injury and restoration of neurological function were assessed using Frankel classification. Patients in group A were treated with anterior operation, whereas group B was posterior operation. Postoperatively, VAS score, kyphotic Cobb angle, anterior vertebra height, and pathologic vertebra wedge angle were all significantly improved in patients with Kümmell's disease receiving modified posterior operation (group B). Similar results were also observed in patients with anterior operation. The improvement of VAS and correction rate of kyphotic Cobb angle indicated equivalent effects of posterior and anterior operations. Meanwhile, alleviated neurological function damage was observed in 2 groups. Relevant factor analysis illustrated that there was no significant correlation of the severity and improvement rate of pain symptoms with age, medical history, anterior and posterior vertebra heights, kyphotic Cobb angle, and pathological vertebra wedge angle. Compared with traditional anterior approach, modified posterior operation, adopting transpedicular vertebral body grafting combined with vertebral pedicle screw fixation, could produce equivalent effects on kyphosis correction, pain relief, and improvement of neurological function in patients with Kümmell's disease.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) between by unilateral approach and by bilateral approaches for treating mid-thoracic osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
Methods: 
A prospective randomized controlled study was performed on 22 patients with mid-thoracic OVCF between September 2012 and June 2014. PKP was performed by unilateral approach in 11 cases (group A) and by bilateral approaches in 11 cases (group B). There was no significant difference in gender, age, causes of injury, disease duration, affected segment, preoperative bone mineral density, Cobb angle, compression rate of the anterior verterbral height, and Visual analogue scale (VAS) score between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The operation time, perspective times, hospitalization expenses, the leakage of cement, the sagittal Cobb angle, compression rate of the anterior vertebral height, and VAS scores were compared between 2 groups.
Results: 
The operation time, perspective times, and hospitalization expenses of group A were significantly less than those of group B (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients were followed up 13-34 months (mean, 15.3 months). Primary healing of incision was obtained in all patients, and no early complication of cement leakage, hypostatic pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis occurred. At last follow-up, no new fracture occurred at the adjacent segments. The Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior verterbral height, and VAS score at 1 week and last follow-up were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones in 2 groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between at 1 week and at last follow-up (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in Cobb angle, compression rate of the anterior vertebral height, and VAS score between 2 groups at each time point (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
PKP by both unilateral approach and bilateral approaches has the same effectiveness, but unilateral approach has shorter operation time, less perspective times, and less hospitalization expenses than bilateral approaches.},

To compare the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) with conservative therapy for patients with acute vertebral compression fractures.
Design: 
Prospective, nonrandomized, comparison study.
Background: 
The efficacy of PV has not been well established because there have been few comparative studies with conservatively treated control groups.
Patients and methods: 
Fifty-five consecutive patients (8 men and 47 women, age 47-94) with osteoporosis and symptomatic acute vertebral compression fractures were enrolled. thirty-two patients received pv, whereas 23 received conservative therapy.
Outcome measures: 
Changes in pain intensity, physical functioning, and pain medication requirement were evaluated.
Results: 
Both PV and conservative therapy provided pain reduction (P < 0.001), improvements in physical functioning (P < 0.001), and decreased medication (P < 0.001). Reductions in visual analogue pain scores were more significant in the vertebroplasty group at 1 (P < 0.001) and 4 weeks (P < 0.001) but not at 12 months. Improvements in physical functioning were significant at 1 (P < 0.001) and 4 weeks (P < 0.001). Medication requirements were lower in the vertebroplasty group at all three time points.
Conclusions: 
Pain relief, physical functioning improvement, and medication requirement after vertebroplasty are immediately and significantly better when compared with conservative therapy.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To compare complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Background: 
PVP and BKP are two minimally invasive procedures for treating OVCFs, while few studies emphases attention to intra- and post-operative complications about the two procedures.
Methods: 
Online databases were searched for studies comparing complications of PVP and BKP for OVCFs, the randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies that provided related data were identified. Demographic characteristics and complications related to procedures were extracted and analysed from all of the included studies.
Results: 
Nineteen studies encompassing 1,787 patients in total, of whom 887 received PVP and 900 received BKP, met the inclusion criteria. For subsequent fractures, our meta-analysis detected no significant difference between the two procedures, both for adjacent fractures (p = 0.29) and non-adjacent fractures (p = 0.37). For cement extravasations, there was no significant difference between the two interventions if considering disc spaces extravasations only (p = 0.24), while considering total extravasations and paravertebral extravasations, the cement leakage rate in the PVP group was significantly higher than the BKP group (total: p < 0.01; paravertebral: p < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
The two procedures suffer from equal risk of subsequent spinal fractures; PVP has a significant higher cement leakage rate compared to BKP, mainly caused by a higher paravertebral leakage, patients with extremely poor pulmonary function or unstable haemodynamic are better candidates for BKP.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporosis with subsequent osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures is an increasingly important disease due not only to its significant economic impact but also to the increasing age of our population. Pain reduction and stabilization are of primary importance with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Although many patients heal with conservative treatment consisting of rest or activity modification, analgesics, and bracing, the management of severe pain compels some patients to seek surgical intervention via 2 procedures: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Although there is abundant support in the literature for both procedures, there remains debate over which procedure can most successfully reduce patients' perception of pain.
Objective: 
To determine the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Design: 
Meta-analysis
Methods: 
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature was performed to quantify the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Results: 
Twenty-one studies, 14 vertebroplasty and 7 kyphoplasty, qualified for inclusion representing totals of 1,046 vertebroplasty and 263 kyphoplasty patients treated, respectively. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty resulted in a more than 5 point drop in the VAS in the immediate postoperative period (p<0.00001). Between the two, the difference in early pain relief was not significant. At final follow-up, the long-term VAS was improved for both procedures, but the final follow-up VAS for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty was not significant when compared to the initial postoperative VAS (p=0.25, p=0.38, respectively).
Conclusions: 
The analysis demonstrates that both procedures reduce the amount of pain in the immediate postoperative period by approximately 50%. Both procedures reduce pain in symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that have failed conservative treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive data on which procedure is the most effective for vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures. Pain is the main symptom. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a therapeutic procedure performed to reduce pain in vertebral compression fractures. Numerous case series and several small, non-blinded, non-randomized controlled studies have suggested that vertebroplasty is an effective means of relieving pain from osteoporotic fractures. However, a recent pooled analysis from 2 multicenter randomized controlled trials concluded that the improvement in pain afforded by PVP was similar to placebo.
Objective: 
To compare the amount of pain reduction measured using the visual analog scale when OVCF is treated with vertebroplasty or conservatively, and assess the clinical utility of PVP.
Design: 
A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing pain reduction following vertebroplasty and conservative treatment.
Limitations: 
There were few data sources from which to extract abstracted data or published studies. There were only 5 randomized controlled trials that met our criteria. The conservative treatments used as comparators in these trials were different.
Methods: 
A search of MEDLINE from January 1980 to July 2012 using PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Relevant reports were examined by 2 independent reviewers and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using the criteria established in the QUOROM statement.
Results: 
Pooled results from 5 randomized controlled trials are shown. There was no difference in pain relief in the PVP group at 2 weeks and one month when compared with the conservatively managed group. Pain relief in the PVP group was greater than that of the conservative group at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. However, after subgroup analysis, pain scores were similar between the PVP group and the sham injection group from 2 weeks to 6 months. Compared with non-operative therapy, PVP reduced pain at all times studied.
Conclusion: 
PVP has some value for relieving pain; however, the possibility of a placebo effect should be considered. PVP has gained acceptance as a complementary treatment when conservative management has failed before its benefits have been fully understood. More large scale, double blinded, controlled trials are necessary in order to quantify the pain relief afforded by PVP more precisely.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND Following a thoracolumbar burst fracture (TCBF), anterior screw-rods apply pressure upon the graft site. However, there is limited evidence comparing single screw-rod anterior instrumentation (SSRAI) to double screw-rod anterior instrumentation (DSRAI) for TCBFs. Our objective was to compare SSRAI versus DSRAI for TCBFs with incomplete neurological deficit. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 51 participants with T11-L2 TCBFs (AO classification: A3) were randomly assigned to receive SSRAI or DSRAI. Key preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the independent factors associated with inferior clinical outcomes, as well as the comparative efficacy of SSRAI and DSRAI. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the key demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups (all p>0.05). Smoking status was significantly associated with inferior three-month and six-month Denis pain scores (Wald statistic=4.246, p=0.039). Both SSRAI and DSRAI were significantly effective in improving three-month and six-month postoperative degree of kyphosis, three-month and six-month postoperative ASIA impairment scale scores, three-month and six-month postoperative Denis pain score, and three-month and six-month postoperative Denis work score (all p<0.001). Although there were no significant differences between DSRAI and SSRAI with respect to all outcomes (all p>0.05), DSRAI displayed significantly longer operating times, as well as significantly larger operative blood losses (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS SSRAI may be preferable over DSRAI for TCBFs with incomplete neurological deficit due to its lower operating time and amount of operative blood loss.},

To analyze the advantages and disadvantages of bipedicular approach and uni-extrapedicular approach of vertebroplasty in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Methods: 
From January 2008 to December 2010,53 patients with OVCFs were retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 males, 30 females with an average age of 66.9 years (ranged,59 to 88 years). Among them, 26 cases were treated with bipedicular approach, 28 cases were treated with uni-extrapedicular approach. The data of bone cement injection, radiology exposure times, operation time, bone cement leakage and vessels nerve complications were observed. Cobb angle, vertebral compression ration were observed by imaging data, and evaluate recovery of deformity.
Results: 
The data of bone cement injection, radiology exposure times, operation time, VAS score were (6.6 +/- 0.8) ml and (6.8 +/- 1.5) ml, (21.7 +/- 4.0) times and (17.9 +/- 3.6) times, (40.5 +/- 5.5) min and (31.6 +/- 9.1) min, (2.8 +/- 0.6) scores and (3.1 +/- 0.5) scores respectively. Cobb angle,vertebral compression ration were (7.6 +/- 2.0) degrees and (6.9 +/- 2.6) degrees, (18.1 +/- 5.8)% and (16.5 +/- 6.1)%. There were no vascular nerve complications occurred. For bone cement leakage, 3 cases (11%) in bipedicular approach and 3 cases (11%)in uni-extrapedicular approach. There was no significant differences between two groups in VAS score, recovery of vetebral body, Cobb angle, bone cement injection and bone cement leakage, but had significant differences in radiology exposure times and operation time (P<0.05).
Conclusion: 
Both of two approaches can treat OVCFs well, especially extropedicle approach which could reduce operation time and radiation shoot frequency.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is generally performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Technically, single fluoroscope is considered sufficient for effectively monitoring PV. However, single fluoroscopic technique might be time-consuming in rotating the C-arm of the fluoroscope for either antero-posterior (AP) or lateral radiographic view, and causing delay in detecting cement leakage that can occur if the correct sight is not given. The aim of the current investigation was to compare the efficacy and safety of performing PV using one or two sets of fluoroscope.
Methods: 
This retrospective study enrolled 43 patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures and they were treated with one-level PV. A single orthopaedic surgeon operated on all these patients. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the method of fluoroscopic control. In Group 1 (15 patients), PV was performed under the assistance of one fluoroscope. In Group 2 (28 patients), PV was performed under the control of two fluoroscopes. The mean follow-up was 19 months (range, 12 to 30).
Results: 
Neither symptomatic cement leakage nor postoperative infection was found in both groups. The mean operation time in Group 2 was shorter, 37.8 vs. 31.0 minutes for Groups 1 and 2, P = 0.03. The incidence of cement leakage for Groups 1 and 2 was 26.7% (4/15) vs. 14.3% (4/28), respectively, P = 0.19.
Conclusion: 
We found that the two-fluoroscopic technique can provide simultaneous, real-time AP and lateral radiographic views to monitor entry point and cement delivery for PV and therefore reduce the operation time. The two-fluoroscopic technique did not require a complex manpower organization and has been proved to be a safe and effective technique for PV.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral compression fractures are common among the elderly, which is conditioned by osteoporosis. They cause back pain and limit the patient's activities. The Kiva® VCF Treatment System is a new device to treat vertebral compression fractures. Compared to other methods, the utilization of the Kiva System reduces the risk for complications and delivers improvements in back pain reduction and functionality.
Objectives: 
Evaluation of safety and effectiveness of the Kiva System in comparison to balloon kyphoplasty on the basis of matched pairs.
Methods: 
52 patients (47 - 89 years, 68 fractures) were treated with balloon kyphoplasty or with the new Kiva System. Back pain and impairment of motility were assessed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The operation time and cement extravasation were recorded. Control radiographs were evaluated for new fractures and vertebral heights.
Results: 
Mean VAS values in both groups improved from preoperatively 87.6 ± 12.8 and 83.1 ± 14.9 to 10.8 ± 20.8 and 24.6 ± 11.0 6 months after the treatment. The improvement after 6 months in the Kiva group was significantly better than in the balloon kyphoplasty group (P < 0.0001). Mean ODI scores in both groups also improved from 68.7% ± 15.8% in the Kiva group and 80.6% ± 8.6% in the balloon kyphoplasty group preoperatively to 24.8 ± 18.6% and 33.2 ± 6.3% 6 months after treatment. The mean operation time for the Kiva group was 12.7 ± 3.7 minutes per vertebra and cement leakage occurred in 6 patients. The mean operation time for the balloon kyphoplasty group was 34.1 ± 7.0 minutes per vertebra and cement leakage occurred in 8 patients. Anterior and mid vertebral height in the Kiva group increased from preoperatively 21.06 ± 7.44 mm and 18.36 ± 5.64 mm to postoperatively 22.41 ± 7.14 mm and 20.41 ± 6.00 mm. Anterior and mid vertebral height in the balloon kyphoplasty group increased from preoperatively 21.68 ± 2.06 mm and 21.97 ± 1.78 mm to postoperatively 25.09 ± 2.54 mm and 25.29 ± 2.10 mm. Vertebral height restoration could be therefore maintained with both procedures for 6 months. In the Kiva group 2 cases of nonadjacent fractures and one case of adjacent fractures were observed. In the balloon kyphoplasty group 9 cases of adjacent, as well as 5 cases of nonadjacent, fractures were observed. In the Kiva group significant fewer fractures occurred.
Limitations: 
The study includes only 26 patients for each procedure, which were compared on the basis of matched pairs.
Conclusion: 
The Kiva System appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Six months after treatment with the Kiva System, better VAS values than the values after the treatment with balloon kyphoplasty were recorded. Reduction in functional impairment was as successful as it was after balloon kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was observed in both groups, which was sustained for 6 months. The risk of cement extravasation during the Kiva Treatment is nearly the same as in balloon kyphoplasty; however, it requires a shorter operation time and produces less new fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database in a tertiary hospital over 10 years.
Objective: 
Treatment for vertebral compression fractures remains an area of controversy with respect to timing and type of surgical management. We analyzed the clinical outcomes and radiographic measurements of 4 different modalities of treatment for these fractures.
Summary of background data: 
From 2001 to 2011, we analyzed a total of 363 patients after failure of 30 days of conservative management. These patients were then further managed either conservatively or with vertebroplasty, balloon kyphoplasty, or sky bone expander. Outcomes were assessed by using self-report measures: Visual Analog Score; functional measures: Oswestry Disability Index and Short-Form 36; and physiological measures: preoperative and postoperative radiographs.
Methods: 
The outcome measures were assessed for 6 months for those treated conservatively and up till 2 years for those treated surgically. Radiographic measurements of the spine were correlated with the clinical outcomes.
Results: 
A total of 62 patients (12.1%) were treated conservatively, 148 (40.8%) with vertebroplasty, 97 (26.7%) with balloon kyphoplasty, and 56 (15.4%) with sky bone expander. We found significant improvements in Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Short-Form-36 scores for all groups after 1-month follow-up (P<0.05), with the surgical groups demonstrating a greater improvement in pain scores after the first postoperative day (P<0.0001) when compared with the conservative group. The improvements in outcomes in those treated surgically were sustained for up to 2 years with no significant difference (P>0.05) among the surgical groups. We also found significant improvement (P<0.005) in anterior vertebral and kyphotic wedge angle after surgical intervention.
Conclusions: 
We have shown that early surgical intervention allows for quicker pain relief compared with conservative treatment, with similar improvements in anterior vertebral height and kyphotic wedge angle between all 3 groups of surgical management.},

  abstract={Objective: 
This study was intended to assess the results of post-operative CT scans in three groups of patients following percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) using different navigation and injection methods, in an attempt to explain the radiological characteristics of extravertebral cement leakage with relation to needle placement and focused on the ventral epidural accumulation of bone cement. Furthermore, we have suggested a morphological (and functional) classification of the types of cement leakage.
Methods: 
Between July 2001 and February 2005, 123 percutaneous VP procedures were performed during 75 sessions in 65 patients for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. These included:- Group I: 28 patients, 33 sessions; 50 right sided unilateral VP under fluoroscopic control with central position of the tip of the needle within the bone marrow. Group II: 27 patients, 28 sessions; 50 bilateral VP under fluoroscopic control with separate cement injections into both "hemivertebrae". Group III: 14 patients, 14 sessions; 23 bilateral VP navigated by frameless stereotaxy (neuronavigation). Needles were positioned strictly into the lateral thirds of the vertebral bodies. Leakages were classified as epidural, foraminal, intradiscal, venous paravertebral, compact extravertebral on the post-operative CT scans, and their frequency was compared in relation to the navigation method and the position of the tip of the needle.
Results: 
Group I: extravertebral cement was detected in 23 patients (82%), and in 35 (70%) of the 50 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 23 vertebrae = 46%; intradiscal: 12 vertebrae = 24%; venous paravertebral: 8 vertebrae = 16%; intraforaminal: 7 vertebrae = 14%; and compact extravertebral: 3 vertebrae = 6%). Group II: extravertebral cement was detected in 20 patients (74%), and in 38 (76%) of the 50 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 12 vertebrae = 24%; intradiscal: 12 vertebrae = 24%; venous paravertebral: 9 vertebrae = 18%; and foraminal: 1 vertebra = 2%). Group III: extravertebral cement could be detected in 10 patients (71%), and in 10 (43%) of the 23 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 3 vertebrae = 13%; intradiscal: 8 vertebrae = 34%; venous paravertebral: 4 vertebrae = 17%).
Conclusion: 
The incidence of epidural accumulation of bone cement may be concluded to be closely correlated with the position of the tip of the needle. Centrally injected bone cement may easily invade into the basivertebral system, and the material can then be transferred via these veins toward the ventral epidural space, and result in canal compromise and/or compression of the neural elements. The results of statistical analysis (Chi-square test) revealed that injection of bone cement into the lateral third of the vertebral body significantly decreases the extent of ventral epidural leakage. Therefore, a strictly lateral injection is advised, when the tip of the needle is placed into the lateral third of the vertebral body. Frameless stereotaxy navigation improves achievement of accurate needle placement and decreases the frequency of ventral epidural leakage. It is a safe and very accurate method for positioning of the injecting needles.},

To investigate the effectiveness of kyphoplasty in treating osteoporotic vertebral fracture according to comparative study.
Methods: 
Between March 2006 and August 2007, 60 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated. Kyphoplasty was performed in 40 patients (test group) and conservative treatment was performed in 20 patients as control (control group). In test group, there were 6 males and 34 females with an average age of 68.7 years (range, 56-78 years). The disease duration was 10-18 months (mean, 12 months). A total of 73 vertebral bodies fractured. In control group, there were 5 males and 15 females with an average age of 70.1 years (range, 57-80 years). The disease duration was 9-16 months (mean, 13 months). A total of 41 vertebral bodies fractured. There was no significant difference in the general data between 2 groups (P > 0.05).
Results: 
All incisions healed by first intention in test group, and no leakage of bone cement occurred. The patients of 2 groups were followed up 36-38 months. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) questionnaire scores, anterior and middle vertebral column heights, and Cobb angles of test group at 1-3 days, 12 and 36 months after treatment were significantly improved when compared with those before operation (P < 0.05); but there was no significant difference between before treatment and after treatment in control group (P > 0.05). After 12 and 36 months, the VAS scores, EVOS scores, anterior and middle vertebral column heights, and Cobb angles of test group were better than those of control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of vertebral re-fractures was higher in control group than in test group after 36 months (chi2 = 16.347, P = 0.015).
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty can effectively relieve pain and restore the function after the procedure. The risk of vertebral re-fractures after kyphoplasty can be reduced in comparison with conservative treatment.},

  abstract={Background: 
This study was aimed (i) to compare the fusion rates of rod-based laminar claw hook constructs to that of posterior C1/C2 screw constructs in odontoid fractures, and (ii) to evaluate any complications associated with claw hook/rod constructs. To our knowledge, no study in contemporary literature has presented the effects of using modern rod-based laminar claw hooks for treating odontoid fractures. Unlike laminar clamps from the 1980s, contemporary laminar hook-rod instrumentation systems provide better immobilisation of the cervical spine and allows for building reliable frame-like constructs similar to cervical screw-rod systems.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of a series of 167 consecutive odontoid fractures from a single-institution was conducted. 30 cases from the series were treated using posterior atlantoaxial fusion, 12 using C1/C2 posterior screws (control group), and 18 with rod-based laminar claw hooks (study group). Hooks were mounted bilaterally in a claw manner on each individual lamina and were rigidly fixed to perpendicular rods with a transverse connector whenever feasible. The minimum follow-up period was one year. Bony union was determined using computed tomography (CT) scan, while stability at the fusion site was assessed using dynamic radiograms.
Results: 
The study group had an overall fusion rate of 89% (non-geriatric 93% while geriatric subgroup 75%) with a 100% stability rate at the fusion site in all cases. In the control group fusion rate was 100%. There were no major complications in both control and study groups. Four minor complications, three in the control and one in the study group, were noted in 3 patients.
Conclusion: 
Preliminary results of this study suggest that laminar claw hook-rod systems are useful alternatives to posterior screw techniques. Moreover, the fusion rate in non-geriatric patients is comparable to that of posterior screws. Importantly, they are devoid of the disadvantages and complications posed by screw constructs. Further studies are necessary to confirm these promising results.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
As life expectancy in the population rises, osteoporotic fractures are seen most frequently in the proximal femur and the vertebral column. In balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, we have two minimally invasive treatment procedures available. Although they have both been controversially discussed in studies, they have seldom been directly compared.
Materials and methods: 
Between 2002 and 2004, patients with fresh thoracic or lumbar single-segment vertebral compression fractures not involving neurological deficits were treated by balloon kyphoplasty (n = 30) or vertebroplasty(n = 30) using PMMA cement, and the results of the two interventions were compared in a prospective, nonrandomised cohort study. Surgery was indicated when patients had painful, dislocated fractures of type A1 and type A3 according to Magerl's classification. The outcome of treatment was assessed with special reference to the angle of kyphosis, back pain (VAS), health-related quality of life (SF-36) and complications.
Results: 
At the time of the follow-up examination, significant improvement in the angle of kyphosis was found to have been achieved both by kyphoplasty and by vertebroplasty (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Comparison showed that correction of the angle was significantly (P < 0.001) better in the kyphoplasty group. Both surgical procedures led to significant (P < 0.001) attenuation of the patients' pain; no difference was observed between the groups in the degree of pain relief achieved. There was no demonstrable correlation in either group between the preoperative pain experienced by the patients and the degree of dislocation of their fractures. In both study groups, the quality of life was in keeping with that of a reference group matched for age and sex. Cement leakage was observed in 7% of patients after kyphoplasty and in 33% of patients after vertebroplasty (P = 0.021). Adjacent-level fractures were checked for, but occurred in only one patient in the vertebroplasty group.
Conclusion: 
The two surgical procedures were both followed by significant pain relief, and the quality of life was similar regardless of the procedure used. Balloon kyphoplasty led to an ongoing reduction of freshly fractured vertebrae and was followed by a lower rate of cement leakage.},

  abstract={Balloon kyphoplasty is a common treatment for osteoporotic and pathologic compression fractures. Advantages include minimal tissue disruption, quick recovery, pain relief, and in some cases prevention of progressive sagittal deformity. The benefit of image-based navigation in kyphoplasty has not been established. The goal of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between fluoroscopy-guided balloon kyphoplasty and 3-dimensional image-based navigation in terms of needle malposition rate, cement leakage rate, and radiation exposure time. The authors compared navigated and nonnavigated needle placement in 30 balloon kyphoplasty procedures (47 levels). Intraoperative 3-dimensional image-based navigation was used for needle placement in 21 cases (36 levels); conventional 2-dimensional fluoroscopy was used in the other 9 cases (11 levels). The 2 groups were compared for rates of needle malposition and cement leakage as well as radiation exposure time. Three of 11 (27%) nonnavigated cases were complicated by a malpositioned needle, and 2 of these had to be repositioned. The navigated group had a significantly lower malposition rate (1 of 36; 3%; P=.04). The overall rate of cement leakage was also similar in both groups (P=.29). Radiation exposure time was similar in both groups (navigated, 98 s/level; nonnavigated, 125 s/level; P=.10). Navigated kyphoplasty procedures did not differ significantly from nonnavigated procedures except in terms of needle malposition rate, where navigation may have decreased the need for needle repositioning.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To use imaging, histology and electrophysiological assessment to compare the Wiltse approach to pedicle fixation with the conventional posterior open approach for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
We analyzed clinical and histopathological information of consecutive patients with thoracolumbar fractures who underwent short-segment pedicle fixation using either the Wiltse approach or the posterior open approach. Seventy-five patients were enrolled between June 2010 and August 2014 (Wiltse group 35 cases; posterior open group 40 cases). The two groups were compared for MRI appearance, histological and electrophysiological changes in multifidus muscle.
Results: 
On MRI, multifidus cross-sectional area (CSA) in the Wiltse group decreased by only 7.6% between pre-op and the last follow-up, compared to 35.4% in the posterior open group, and less fatty infiltration was found in the Wiltse group. Histologically, post-op (removal of internal fixation) tissue from the posterior open group showed disordered myofibrils, with diameter and CSA decreased by 11.6 and 24.3%, respectively; also, the myofibril gap became larger with fat deposition and scar formation. The Wiltse group had no such significant changes. Electrophysiologically, in the posterior open group, median frequency slope (MFs) significantly increased by 67.6% with average amplitude (AA) significantly decreased by 17.5% between pre-op and 12 months post-op. No significant changes were found in the Wiltse group. At 12 months post-op, AA was significantly lower and MFs was higher in the posterior open group than the Wiltse group.
Conclusion: 
The Wiltse approach showed a lower incidence of multifidus atrophy and denervation, and less fatty infiltration. It is an effective and minimally invasive approach for thoracolumbar fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective controlled study of the clinical and radiographic results of a group of 42 cases having undergone anterior screw fixation for type II and rostal type III odontoid fractures.
Objective: 
The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous anterior screw fixation as an alternative new technique in the management of type II and rostal type III odontoid fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Minimally invasive spinal techniques have only recently been developed. However, clinical and radiographic outcome of minimally invasive anterior screw fixation for odontoid fractures has been evaluated in very few studies. There have been no prospective clinical reports published on the comparison of percutaneous anterior screw fixation for type II and "shallow" type III odontoid fractures or a traditional open manner.
Methods: 
Forty-two patients, 26 men and 16 women, with an average age of 47.1 years (32-65) were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent percutaneous anterior screw fixation(n = 19) or open screw fixation (n = 23). The following data were compared between the two groups: operative time, blood loss, radiograph exposure time, the clinical and radiographic results, and complications. Radiologic examination of the cervical spine with plain radiographs was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.
Results: 
In comparison with open fixation group, percutaneous fixation group had significantly less operating time and less blood loss. The radiation time and clinical outcome were basically identical in two groups. Radiographic evaluation showed satisfactory bony union and no evidence of abnormal movement at the fracture site in both percutaneous fixation group (18 of 19 cases) and open fixation group (22 of 23 cases). Two cases of postoperative dysphagia occurred in open screw fixation group.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous anterior screw fixation is a safe and reliable procedure for treatment of type II and rostral type III odontoid fractures with potential advantages.},

Vertebroplasty and BK are the common surgical interventions for the treatment of VCF. Both are effective and safe but pose some risks such as adjacent fractures and cement leakage. In 2009, RF-TVA was introduced as an innovative augmentation procedure for the treatment of VCF.

A total of 192 patients (116 female; 51-90 y) with VCF (n=303) at 1 to 3 levels were treated with RF-TVA or BK. Functionality (Oswestry Disability Index), pain (visual analogue scale), vertebral height (anterior, middle), and kyphotic angle were evaluated over a 2-year period (postoperatively, 3-4 d, 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo). In addition, operating time and occurrence of cement leakage were recorded.
Results: 
Pain and functionality were significantly improved after both treatments. In both groups, there was an increase in the vertebral height and a decrease in the kyphotic angle, which remained relatively consistent during 24 months. The incidence of cement leakage was 9.4% (n=9) in the RF-TVA group and 24.0% (n=25) in the BK group. The mean operating time with radiofrequency kyphoplasty was 25.9±9.9 minutes, and with balloon kyphoplasty 48.0±18.4 minutes.
Conclusions: 
RF-TVA is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures when compared with BK. Improvement in pain and functional scores after RF-TVA are durable through 24 months postprocedure and remained better than those after BK at long-term follow-up. Operating time for RF-TVA is shorter and the risk of cement leakage is lower. Both procedures provided similar results in vertebral height restoration and reduction in the kyphotic angle.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Percutaneous kyphoplasty is effective for pain reduction and vertebral height restoration in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. However, in cases of severely collapsed fractures involving the loss of more than 70% of the vertebral height, kyphoplasty is technically difficult to perform and the outcomes remain unknown.
Purpose: 
To compare the vertebral height restoration rate, kyphotic angle, and clinical results of patients who underwent kyphoplasty according to the degree of anterior vertebral height loss. In addition, to determine the feasibility and effects of kyphoplasty on severely collapsed osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
Study design::Setting: 
A retrospective study.
Patient sample: 
A total of 129 patients (145 vertebrae) who underwent kyphoplasty for osteoporotic painful vertebral fracture and followed up for more than 1 year between September 2005 and August 2012 were recruited for the analysis.
Outcome measures: 
The patients' kyphotic angle, anterior vertebral height, and anterior vertebral height restoration ratio 1 year after surgery were compared. Pre- and postoperative pain around the fractured vertebra and the radiological and clinical results according to bone mineral density (BMD) were also compared.
Methods: 
Patients were divided into three groups for comparison, according to radiographic findings. Patients with an anterior height compression ratio more than 70% at the time of fracture comprised Group I, patients with a compression ratio of 50-70% comprised Group II, and those with a compression ratio of 30-50% comprised Group III.
Results: 
Group I showed a greater extent of anterior height restoration immediately after surgery compared with the other groups, which noticeably decreased over time. All three groups showed significant restoration of the anterior vertebral height between pre- and postoperative values. The anterior vertebral height 1 year after surgery did not differ between Group I and Group II but was significantly higher in Group III. There was no correlation between the BMD and restoration or decrease of anterior vertebral height over time. Pain around the fractured vertebra significantly decreased in all groups immediately and 1 year after surgery compared with preoperative levels, although the pain level 1 year after surgery did not differ significantly between the groups.
Conclusions: 
In patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio more than 70% because of osteoporotic vertebral fracture, although the anterior height and kyphotic angle were significantly lower than those of patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio of 30% to 50%, kyphoplasty significantly improved the degree of pain, restored the anterior vertebral height, and maintained the kyphotic angle. Therefore, kyphoplasty can be a useful approach in patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio more than 70%.},

  abstract={Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) afflicts most aged people. Except for conservative therapy (CT), percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are another two the common choices, but current evaluation of their efficacy is not performed. All the trial data were originated from electronic database including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Four indicators with mean difference (MD) or odd ratio (OR) with their 95% credible interval (95% CrI) were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy, including the value of visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), relieving kyphotic angle (KA), and rate of fracture. Besides, the results were demonstrated in the forest plots and slash tables. Furthermore, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated. A total of 32 trials among 2,852 patients are included. Using network comparison, we found that PKP and PVP both have good performance as OVCF treatments. However, in different aspects, PKP seemed to be the best to eliminate pain with high value of SUCRA on ODI and VAS (0.624 and 0.588, respectively), and PVP had better performance in KA and decreasing incidence of fracture. The micro-operative therapy, both PKP and PVP, had better efficacy than CT in four aspects. And PKP was better in pain alleviating, according to VAS and ODI results, while PVP had the superiority in KA and reducing the incidence of fracture. J. Cell.

  abstract={Objective: 
The objective of this study was to compare perioperative, clinical parameters, complications, and reoperation rate of the Gallie technique and head-neck-chest plaster with the Harms technique in the treatment of odontoid fractures.
Design: 
A retrospective study.
Setting: 
Level I spine center.
Patients: 
Fifty-seven patients with odontoid fractures treated either with the Gallie technique and casting or the Harms technique between July 2002 and June 2008.
Intervention: 
Surgery.
Main outcome measurements: 
At a minimum of 2-year follow-up, comparison of the two groups was conducted in terms of hospital stay, blood loss, operation time, cost of the first admission, total cost, time to fusion, time to return to previous occupation, Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, visual analog scale scores of neck pain, complications (nonunion, delayed union, hardware breakage, wound infection), and reoperation rate.
Results: 
There were no significant differences in terms of hospital stay, time to fusion, Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, neck pain visual analog scale scores, complications, or reoperation rate between the two groups. Blood loss, operation time, cost of the first admission, and total cost were significantly lower in the Gallie group than that in the Harms group. However, the Gallie group took longer to return to previous occupation than the Harms group (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
Management of odontoid fractures by either the Gallie technique and casting or the Harms technique was found to be similar in clinical outcomes. Although the Harms technique was associated with more blood loss, operation time, and cost, the Harms technique was found to be superior to the Gallie technique with casting in terms of time to return to previous occupation.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
To analyze and confirm the advantages of anterior cervical distraction and screw elevating-pulling reduction which are absent in conventional anterior cervical reduction for traumatic cervical spine fractures and dislocations.
Materials and methods: 
A retrospective study was conducted on 86 patients with traumatic cervical spine fractures and dislocations who received one-stage anterior approach treatment for a distraction-flexion injury with bilateral locked facet joints between January 2010 and June 2015. They were 54 males and 32 females with an age ranging from 20 to 73 years (average age, 40.1 ± 5.6 years). These patients were distributed into group A and group B in the sequence of visits, with 44 cases of conventional anterior cervical reduction (group A) and 42 cases of anterior cervical distraction and screw elevating-pulling reduction (group B). Comparison of intraoperative blood loss, operation duration and vertebral reduction rate was made between the two groups. The follow-up time was 12-18 months, and the clinical outcomes of surgery were evaluated according to ASIA score, VAS score and JOA score.
Results: 
Statistically significant difference was revealed between group A and group B in the surgical time and the correction rate of cervical spine dislocation (p < 0.05), with the results of group B better than those of group A. For the two groups, statistically significant difference was shown between the ASIA score, VAS score and JOA score before and after operation (p < 0.05), with the results better after operation, while no statistically significant difference was revealed in such scores between the two groups (p > 0.05), with the therapeutic effect of group A the same with that of group B.
Conclusions: 
Anterior cervical distraction and screw elevating-pulling reduction is simple with low risk, short operation duration, good effect of intraoperative vertebral reduction and well-recovered function after the operation. Meanwhile, as a safe and effective operation method for cervical spine fractures and dislocations, it can reduce postoperative complications and the risk of the iatrogenic cervical spinal cord injury caused by prying or facet joint springing during conventional reduction, having more obvious advantages compared to the conventional surgical reduction adopted by group A, with good cervical spine stability as shown in long-term follow-up. Therefore, it is suitable for clinical promotion and application.},

Cement vertebroplasty has been performed for over a decade to treat painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Kyphoplasty is considered a further step in the evolution of vertebral augmentation.
Objectives: 
To evaluate the efficiency and safety of two systems to treat OVCF: Confidence Vertebroplasty (CV) compared to Sky Kyphoplasty (SK).
Methods: 
This prospective study included 45 patients with OVCF. Fourteen were treated with CV and 31 with SK. An imaging evaluation using a compression ratio (height of anterior vs. posterior wall) and local kyphotic deformity (Cobb angle) was performed prior to the procedure and 12 months later. Evaluation of pain was carried out using a visual analogue scale.
Results: 
The mean compression repair was 12% in the CV group compared to 25% in the SK group. Mean kyphotic deformity restoration achieved using CV was 41% compared to 67% using SK. In both groups the pain severity was equally reduced by a mean of 43%.
Conclusions: 
The SK system is technically superior in restoring the vertebral height and repairing the kyphotic deformity, an advantage that was not manifested in pain relief - the most important variable. Both systems have a high level of safety. The cost-benefit balance clearly favors the CV system.},

  abstract={Background: 
The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the safety and effectiveness of unilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) compared with that of bilateral treatment.
Methods: 
The multiple databases including PubMed, Springer, EMBASE, OVID, and China Journal Full-text Database were adopted to search for relevant studies in English or Chinese, and full-text articles involving comparison of unilateral and bilateral PVP surgery were reviewed. Review Manager 5.0 was adopted to estimate the effects of the results among selected articles. Forest plots, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis for the articles included were also conducted.
Results: 
Finally, 1043 patients were included in the 14 studies, which eventually satisfied the eligibility criteria, and unilateral and bilateral surgeries were 550 and 493, respectively. The meta-analysis suggested that there was no significant difference of VAS score, ODI score, and cement leakage rate (MD = 0.12, 95%CI [-0.03, 0.26], P = 0.11; MD = -1.28, 95%CI [-3.59, 1.04], P = 0.28; RR = 0.89, 95%CI [0.61, 1.29], P = 0.52). The surgery time of unilateral PVP is much less than that of bilateral PVP (MD = -16.67, 95%CI [-19.22, -14.12], P < 0.00001). Patients with bilateral PVP surgery have been injected more cement than patients with unilateral PVP surgery (MD = -1.55, 95%CI [-1.94, -1.16], P < 0.00001).
Conclusions: 
Both punctures provide excellent pain relief and improvement of life quality. We still encourage the use of the unipedicular approach as the preferred surgical technique for treatment of OVCFs due to less operation time, limited X-ray exposure, and minimal cement introduction and extravasation.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To compare the short- and long-term clinical outcomes, operation times, restoration rate, dosage of polymethylmeth-acrylate (PMMA) injected, complications and X-rays exposure frequency between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty approaches for the treatment of OVCF.
Study design: 
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods: 
Randomized or non-randomized controlled trials published up to April 2015 that compared the unilateral and bilateral PKP for the treatment of OVCF were acquired by a comprehensive search in the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, OVID. Exclusion criteria were patients with neoplastic etiology (metastasis or myeloma), infection, neural compression syndrome, invasive and degenerative disease, traumatic fracture, re-operation, neurological deficits, significant scoliosis and spinal stenosis. The main end points included: operation times, the short- and long-term postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, the short-term postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), restoration rate, dosage of PMMA injected, cement leakage, X-ray exposure frequency and postoperative adjacent-level fractures.
Results: 
A total of 8 studies involving 428 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean operative time was shorter in the unilateral groups compared with the bilateral groups [P < 0.05, weighted mean difference (WMD) -19.74 (-30.56, -8.92)]. There was no significant difference in the short-term postoperative VAS scores [P > 0.05, WMD 0.03 (-0.34, 0.40)], the long-term postoperative VAS scores between them [P > 0.05, WMD 0.01 (-0.42, 0.45)] and the short-term postoperative ODI [P > 0.05, WMD -0.33 (-2.36, 1.69)] between the two groups. The unilateral approaches required significantly less dosage of PMMA than the bipedicular approaches did [P < 0.05, WMD -1.56 (-1.59, -1.16)]. The restoration rate in the bilateral groups was higher than the unilateral groups [P < 0.05, WMD -7.82 (-12.23, -3.41)]. There was no significant difference in the risk ratio of cement leakage [P > 0.05, RR 0.86 (0.36, 2.06)] and postoperative adjacent-level fractures [P > 0.05, RR 0.91 (0.25, 3.26)] between the two methods. The mean X-ray exposure frequency in the unilateral groups was greater than the bilateral groups [P < 0.05, WMD -5.69 (-10.67, -0.70)].
Conclusions: 
A definitive verdict could not be reached regarding which approach is better for the treatment of OVCF. Although unilateral PKP was associated with shorter operative time, less X- ray exposure frequency and dosage of PMMA than bilateral PKP. There was no apparent difference in the short- and long-term clinical outcomes and complications between them. However, bilateral PKP approaches were higher than unilateral PKP in term of the restoration rate. But on account of lack of some high-quality evidence, we hold that amounts of high-quality randomized controlled trials should be required and more complications should be analysed to resolve which surgical approach is better for the treatment of OVCF in the future.},

  abstract={Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) has been used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures for over 10 years; however, clinically speaking it is still controversial as to whether the use of unipedicular PKP or bipedicular PKP is best. Our study aimed to compare the different effects of unipedicular PKP and bipedicular PKP on the stiffness of compression fractured vertebral bodies (VBs), as well as to assess how cement distribution affect the bilateral biomechanical balance of the VBs. During this study, 30 thoracic VBs were compressed, creating vertebral compression fracture models; then they were augmented by unipedicular (group A and B) PKP and bipedicular (group C) PKP. In group A (unipedicular PKP), the cement was injected into one side and the augmentation was limited to the same side of the VB. In group B (unipedicular PKP), the cement was injected at only one side but the augmentation extended across the midline and filled both sides of the VB. In group C (bipedicular PKP), the cement was injected into both sides and thus achieved the bilateral augmentation. For the unipedicular PKP, the amount of cement injected was 15% of the original VB volume; while in bipedicular PKP, the amount of cement injected was a total of 20% of the original VB volume (10% was injected into each side). Using a MTS-858, we examined three phases of the VBs (intact, pre-augmented, post-augmented), by applying loads axially to the total vertebra and bilateral sides of the vertebra for each of three cycles, respectively. The changes of force and displacement were then recorded and the stiffness of the total vertebra and bilateral sides of the vertebra were calculated. For the pre-augmentation stage, the total VB stiffness of groups A, B and C significantly decreased when the compression fracture models were established (P < 0.05). After the cement augmentation (the post-augmentation stage), both groups A and B, showed that the stiffness could be restored to the initial, intact state; however, in group C, the stiffness was significantly higher than the initial, intact state (P < 0.01). The stiffness of the augmented side of group A was significantly higher than the non-augmented side (P < 0.001). In groups B and C, no significant differences were observed in the stiffness between total VB and each individual side. Thus, we can conclude that both unipedicular PKP and bipedicular PKP significantly increase the total VB stiffness. Bipedicular PKP creates stiffness uniformly across both sides of the vertebrae, while unipedicular PKP, creates a biomechanical balance depending on the distribution of cement. If bone cement is augmented only on one side, the stiffness of non-augmented side will be significantly lower than the augmented side, which might lead to an imbalance of stress on the VB. However, when cement augmentation crosses the midline, stiffness of both sides increase comparatively and biomechanical balance is thus achieved.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PKP) has proved its effectiveness regarding minimal invasion, rapid pain reduction, safe cement augmentation, restoring vertebral height, and accelerating complete recovery of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Whether unipedicular or bipedicular PKP provides a better outcome is controversial.
Methods: 
We searched PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Knowledge, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Data from January 1980 to March 2013 with "kyphoplasty", "unipedicular", "bipedicular", "compression fracture", and "randomized controlled trial". Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed according to a 12-item scale. Meta-analysis was performed. Dichotomous and continuous variables were calculated using the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively.
Results: 
Seven studies involving 440 patients and 559 vertebral bodies met the criteria for inclusion. Among them, one randomized controlled trial had a high risk of bias and six a low risk. The pain visual analogue scale (VAS) SMDs were -0.02 (P = 0.88) for short-term follow-up (≤3 months) and 0.03 (P = 0.82) for long-term follow-up (≥ 1 year). Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) SMDs at short- and long-term follow-up were not statistically significant (-0.04, P = 0.77 and -0.07, P = 0.74, respectively). This meta-analysis showed greater polymethylmethacrylate volume (SMD -1.08, P = 0.00) and operation time (SMD -2.40, P = 0.00), favoring unipedicular PKP. Radiographic outcomes-preoperative kyphosis angle, restoration rate, reduction angle, loss of reduction angle-were not statistically different between the groups. Pooled analyses of cement leakage and subsequent adjacent OVCFs showed no significant differences between the groups, with OR = 0.82 (P = 0.79) and OR = 1.41 (P = 0.70), respectively.
Conclusions: 
This meta-analysis comparing unipedicular and bipedicular PKP demonstrated no significant differences regarding VAS, ODI, radiographic outcomes, or complications. Considering the longer operation time and radiation exposure with bipedicular PKP, we recommend unipedicular PKP over bipedicular PKP for treating OVCFs.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Previous investigators have reported on benefits and risks associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, but there are limited comparison data available. Additionally, much of the data is from retrospective studies and case series.
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study is to review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of pain relief and risk of complications associated with vertebroplasty versus kyphoplasty.
Study design: 
A meta-analysis of the literature on effectiveness of pain control and risk of complications after vertebroplasty versus balloon kyphoplasty. Outcomes measures include visual analog scale and complications.
Methods: 
A comprehensive review of the literature was performed. All studies providing information on pain relief and complications were included. Preoperative, postoperative, and change in visual analog scale (VAS) scores were tabulated. Data were analyzed to identify if a significant improvement in the VAS score occurred. Changes in the VAS scores were compared for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to determine if there was a significant difference.
Results: 
A total of 1,036 abstracts were identified. Of these, 168 studies met the inclusion criteria. Mean pre- and postoperative VAS scores for vertebroplasty were 8.36 and 2.68, respectively, with a mean change of 5.68 (p<.001). The mean pre- and postoperative VAS scores for kyphoplasty were 8.06 and 3.46, respectively, with a mean change of 4.60 (p<.001). There was statistically greater improvement found with vertebroplasty versus kyphoplasty (p<.001). The risk of new fracture was 17.9% with vertebroplasty versus 14.1% with kyphoplasty (p<.01). The risk of cement leak was 19.7% with vertebroplasty versus 7.0% with kyphoplasty (p<.001).
Conclusions: 
Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty provided significant improvement in VAS pain scores. Vertebroplasty had a significantly greater improvement in pain scores but also had statistically greater risk of cement leakage and new fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Few studies have compared the surgical outcomes of vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) with intravertebral clefts.
Methods: 
A retrospective study was conducted to review patients with a single-level osteoporotic VCF treated by VP or KP. Intravertebral clefts were assessed by preoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance scans. All enrolled patients were followed up for 12 months. Clinical outcomes, radiological findings and complications were evaluated.
Results: 
A total of 53 patients were available for data analysis. Most of the fractures (75.5 %) occurred in the region of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2). Twenty-four patients received VP and 29 patients received KP. Patients in both group had significant pain relief after surgery (P < 0.01). Compared with VP group, there was a significant lower visual analogue scale (VAS) score in KP group at the 6- (P = 0.04) and 12-month follow-up (P = 0.02), but the decreased values of VAS score had no significant correlation with the magnitude of deformity correction. Restoration of vertebral body height and reduction in kyphotic angle were achieved in both groups, and the magnitude of correction was more significant in KP group (P < 0.01). Cement leakage rate in VP group (66.7 %) was higher than that in KP group (20.7 %), and there was a significant difference (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
Intravertebral clefts occur primarily at the thoracolumbar junction and can be detected easily by CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Both VP and KP are effective in the treatment of clefts, but patients in KP group tend to have a better pain relief at the medium and long-term follow-up. However, the better pain relief effect of KP cannot be attributed to the higher magnitude of deformity correction.},

  abstract={Aim: 
The efficacy of vertebroplasty on acute vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) has not yet been established. This study, focusing on patients with acute VCFs, aims to compare therapeutic effects between vertebroplasty and vertebral perforation without cement injection.
Material and methods: 
Fifty-five patients with single painful VCFs were assigned to undergo vertebroplasty (Vertebroplasty group; 28 patients) or vertebral perforation (Perforation group; 27 patients). Analgesic effects before and after surgery were compared between 2 groups. Furthermore, the frequency of new VCFs during the follow-up period was compared.
Results: 
In both groups, the visual analog scale (VAS) scores markedly decreased immediately after surgery and remained low until 90 days after surgery (p < 0.05). However, in the Perforation group, the analgesic effect from postoperative day 7 to 90 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral mobility before surgery than those without mobility (p < 0.05). New fractures after surgery occurred in 12 (42.9%) of the 28 patients in the Vertebroplasty group and 8 (29.6%) of the 27 patients in the Perforation group (p =0.054).
Conclusion: 
In acute VCFs, vertebroplasty exerts a marked analgesic effect, which does not differ much from that of vertebral perforation without cement injection. Considering the risk of new postoperative fractures, the application of bone cement infusion should be carefully considered in patients with acute VCF.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical results of balloon percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and "Sky-bone expander" PKP.
Methods: 
From October 2004 to February 2006, 25 cases (57 vertebrae) balloon PKP and 24 cases (29 vertebrae) "Sky-bone expander" PKP procedures were performed. The operation time, bleeding volume, cement injected volume were recorded during operation. The patients' pain relief and functional activities recovery were evaluated after operation. The distribution of the cement and the restoration of vertebral height were also observed post-operation. All these patients were followed-up by telephone or clinic consults after discharged.
Results: 
All cases were successfully experienced procedures. There are no significant differences in operative time, bleeding volume and cost of every vertebrae in these two group (P > 0.05). The balloon group had larger cement injected volume per pedicle than Sky group (4.27 +/- 1.08) ml vs. (3.15 +/- 0.78) ml (P < 0.05). The VAS and ODI scoring of these two groups were both decreased significantly after operation. The vertebral height were restored in both two groups with anterior height and midline height restored significantly in balloon group and midline height restored significantly in Sky group. The cement distribution of "Sky-bone expander" PKP with unipediclar injection mostly limited in the injective side of the vertebral body, but most of the balloon PKP vertebrae with unipediclar injection can be seen a cross-midline cement distribution in the anterior-posterior position X ray film.
Conclusions: 
Both balloon PKP and "Sky-bone expander" PKP are efficacious and safety in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. "Sky-bone expander" PKP is more suitable for single level compressive fracture while balloon PKP is especially suitable for multiple level compressive fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To analyze the radiographic, clinical, and functional results of triangular osteosynthesis constructs for the treatment of vertically unstable comminuted transforaminal sacral fractures.
Setting: 
Level I trauma center.
Methods: 
During a 3-year period (July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2006), 58 patients with vertically unstable pelvic injuries were treated with triangular osteosynthesis fixation by a single surgeon at a single institution. Patients were followed-up prospectively as a single cohort, with institutional review board approval. Inclusion criteria for this study were skeletally mature patients with a vertically unstable pelvic ring injury associated with a comminuted transforaminal sacral fracture. Minimum follow-up, both clinically and radiographically, was 1 year. Computed tomography scan was performed on all patients at 6 months to assess healing of the fracture. If the fracture healed, the fixation was removed. Functional outcome was assessed using the Short Form 36, version 2, and short version of Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment questionnaires at 6 months (before fixation removal) and 12 months.
Results: 
Forty of 58 patients with an average age of 39 years were available for a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Wound complications requiring surgical debridement occurred in 5 patients (13%), all of whom had severe soft tissue wounds with internal degloving. Two patients required removal of infected fixation. Iatrogenic L5 nerve injury occurred in 5 patients (13%). Ten patients (25%) had a delayed union on computed tomography scans, and 3 patients had a nonunion as a result of residual fracture gap and incomplete reduction. Six patients (15%) were found to have pronounced tilting of the L5 vertebral body (scoliosis) and distraction of the L5/S1 facet joint ipsilateral to the fixation. This did not correct with removal of the fixation. Failure of the triangular osteosynthesis construct resulting in malunion occurred in 2 patients (5%). All but 2 patients (95%) complained of painful and prominent implants. Functional outcome scoring showed that patients continued to function below the population mean at 1 year but continued to improve, particularly with function and daily activity. Ninety-seven percent of patients returned to some form of work or schooling.
Conclusions: 
Triangular osteosynthesis fixation is a reliable form of fixation that allows early full weight-bearing at 6 weeks while preventing loss of reduction in comminuted vertical shear transforaminal sacral fractures. For this study group, operative reduction was maintained until healing in 95% of patients. However, the 1-year follow-up shows a substantial rate of potential technical problems and complications. Of primary concern were the asymmetric L5 tilting with L5-S1 facet joint distraction and the need for a second surgery in all patients to remove painful fixation. Iatrogenic nerve injury occurred in 5 patients (13%) and is thought to arise secondary to fracture manipulation and reduction. We recommend selective use of this technique for comminuted transforaminal sacral fractures in situations only where reliable iliosacral or trans-sacral screw fixation is not obtainable.},

  abstract={Aim of the study: 
Previous studies of conventional surgical procedures have shown a significant rate of incorrect pedicle screw placement ranging from 10 to 40%. Transpedicle screw insertion may cause three types of complications: neurologic, vascular and mechanical. The aim of this prospective study is to improve the reliability of pedicle screwing with computer assistance.
Material and methods: 
A new and original technique that combines preoperative computed tomography imaging with intraoperative passive navigation has been used to perform 48 pedicle screwings in the thoracolumbar region. In the same time, 48 pedicle screwings were performed manually in the same region and on the same vertebral levels. With postoperative X-rays and computed tomography examination, screw position related to pedicle position could be assessed and comparison could be made between the two groups (with and without computer assistance).
Results: 
Two screws in 48 vertebra (4%) had incorrect placement with computer assisted technique whereas 18 screws in 48 vertebra (37%) had incorrect placement with manual insertion. The intraoperative accuracy provided by the computer after registration was better than 1 mm. The difference between the two groups was statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001). The cortex penetration observed with the computer assisted technique was not imputed to computer failures. Errors in acquiring data by the surgeon in the pre and peroperative steps may explain the two incorrect placements of the screws.
Conclusion: 
This clinical experience confirms that the accuracy and reliability of this computer assisted technique are very good.},

  abstract={Background: 
The optimal management of odontoid fractures in the elderly population is unclear and management of this group of patients is complicated by multiple co-morbidities. This study aimed to determine the outcomes after conservative management strategies were applied in this patient group.
Methods: 
We carried out retrospective and prospective analyses of all patients with axial cervical spine injuries, at a single centre. We included patients aged over 60 years with type II and III odontoid fractures. Information was gathered on demographics, ASA grading-associated injuries and complications. The outcome measures were rates and type of union, pain and neurological functions, specifically ambulation.
Results: 
Fifty-seven adult patients with a median age of 78 years (range 60-92 years) were included. There were 42 type II and 15 type III odontoid fractures. Three patients required surgical fixation due to displaced fractures, which could not be reduced with manual traction. Twenty-four (41%) patients were managed with a rigid pinned halo orthosis to obtain adequate reduction and immobilisation. The remaining 30 (53%) were managed in a hard cervical collar. Patients managed with a halo were significantly younger and had more associated injuries than patients managed in a collar (age: t-test=4.05, p<0.01, associated injuries: Chi-square=4.38, p<0.05). At a mean follow-up of 25 weeks, 87% of type II and 100% of type III fractures had achieved bony union or stable, fibrous non-union. There were no statistical differences in fracture type, follow-up or neurological outcomes between the halo and collar groups. However, overall more patients managed in a collar developed stable fibrous non-union than bony fusion (Fisher's exact test, p<0.05), although this was not significant when analysed by each fracture type individually. A regression model was constructed and identified fracture type as the only independent predictor of time to union, with type III fractures healing faster than type II.
Conclusions: 
High rates of bony union and stable fibrous non-union with a good functional outcome can be achieved in the elderly population sustaining type II or III odontoid fractures, when managed non-surgically. Halo orthosis may not offer any clear advantage over hard collar in this group. Close follow-up is needed for late complications and there must be a willingness to perform surgery if conservative measures fail.},

  abstract={Background: 
Odontoid fractures are common C-spine fractures in the elderly. However, the optimal treatment of odontoid fractures in the elderly is, still subject to controversy.
Hypothesis: 
Surgical treatment has several advantages on conservative treatment, such as reduced mortality and lower incidence of non-union. This meta-analysis was performed to identify the efficacy of conservative treatment compared with surgical treatment and provides recommendations for using these procedures to treat type II odontoid fractures in the elderly.
Materials and methods: 
A systematic search of all studies published was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, ScienceDirect and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) that compared conservative treatment with surgical treatment and provided data on clinical effects were identified. The included trials were screened out strictly based on the criterion of inclusion and exclusion. The quality of included trials was evaluated. RevMan 5.1 was used for data analysis.
Results: 
Twelve studies involving 730 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 441 patients with conservative treatment and 289 with surgical treatment. The results of meta-analysis indicated that no difference with regard to the mortality was noted (P > 0.05) between the two procedures. However, there was statistically significant difference with respect to the non-union numbers (P < 0.05) between the two procedures.
Discussion: 
Conservative treatment and surgical treatment are both effective procedures for treating type II odontoid fractures in the elderly. Compared with surgical treatment, there is no significant difference in mortality; With respect to non-union numbers, conservative treatment numbers are higher than surgical treatment. Due to the poor quality of the evidence currently available, high quality RCTs are required. Level of evidence Level II: low-powered prospective randomized trial meta-analysis.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort.
Objective: 
The primary goal is to compare the clinical results of 2 types of constructs commonly used at the cervicothoracic junction: small rods (3.2-mm/3.5-mm rods) or transitional constructs. The secondary goal is to perform a case-control study of risk factors for pseudarthrosis at the cervicothoracic junction.
Summary of background data: 
Various constructs have been used to stabilize across the cervicothoracic junction; however, no study to date has objectively compared their outcome. Our hypothesis was that both constructs would have similar fusion and complication rates.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database revealed 135 patients with the aforementioned constructs and having followed up with imaging at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Univariate analysis comparing the 2 different construct groups was performed. Multivariate analysis for risk factors of pseudarthrosis was also performed.
Results: 
There were a total of 10 patients with pseudarthrosis at 2-year follow-up. There was no difference in pseudarthrosis rate between the small rods (7%) and transitional constructs (8.6%) (P = 0.99). The overall construct lengths were similar (5.8 levels in small rods, 6.7 levels in transitional construct). Blood loss was higher in transitional constructs (574 ± 69 mL) than in small rods (236 ± 53 mL) (P < 0.001). Transitional constructs also had longer operating times (249 min) than small rods (207 min) (P < 0.03). Overall complication rate was higher in the transitional constructs (P < 0.03). Tobacco use, corpectomy, lack of an anterior construct, and construct length were all risk factors for cervicothoracic junction pseudarthrosis in the multivariate analysis.
Conclusion: 
Overall pseudarthrosis rates were similar between small rods and transitional constructs. There was higher complications rate, blood loss, and operating time associated with transitional constructs. Pseudarthrosis risk factors at the cervicothoracic junction include tobacco use, corpectomy, lack of an anterior construct, and longer constructs.

  abstract={Objective: 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the advantages of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) for detecting intravertebral clefts over unenhanced MRI in relation to the time since onset of vertebral fracture.
Materials and methods: 
In this retrospective study, a total of 115 patients (88 women, 27 men; mean age, 77.1 years) who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for a single-level compression fracture within 7 days of preprocedural MRI were enrolled. Two radiologists evaluated preprocedural unenhanced MRI (T1-weighted and STIR) and CE-MRI examinations for intravertebral clefts on separate days by consensus. The time from the onset of fracture to MRI was classified into three groups: early phase fractures (< 1 month), late phase fractures (1-3 months), and chronic phase fractures (≥ 3 months). The cement distribution during percutaneous vertebroplasty was used as a reference standard, and detectability of clefts was compared between unenhanced MRI and CE-MRI in relation to the time frame. An analog of the McNemar test was used for analyses.
Results: 
There were 104 patients (90.4%) with and 11 patients (9.6%) without a cleft. The sensitivities of unenhanced MRI and CE-MRI, respectively, for detecting clefts were 60.9% and 91.3% for early phase fractures (p = 0.02); 78.6% and 100% for late phase fractures (p = 0.014); and 92.5% and 94.3% for chronic phase fractures (p = 0.3). The specificities were the same for both groups (100% for each time frame).
Conclusion: 
CE-MRI is more sensitive than unenhanced MRI for detecting intravertebral clefts in patents with benign compression fractures less than 3 months old.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To contrast single and double balloon-inflated kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) and evaluate its clinical efficacy.
Methods: 
From May 2000 to May 2004, 90 consecutive procedures were performed in 58 patients who suffered from painful vertebral compression fractures, transferring tumour and angioma. Ninety vertebrae were inflated while 62 as A group were double balloon and 28 as B group were single balloon, fracture reduction and bone cement augmentation. Preoperative and postoperative symptom levels, variables, complications were recorded and the vertebral height and Cobb angle were measured and analyzed.
Results: 
All patients' pain was alleviated or disappeared without syndrome, and the vertebral height and Cobb angle of both groups were improved. The average recovery rate was 72.6% (22.9% approximately 100%), Cobb angle from 17.9 degrees (3.1 degrees approximately 31.6 degrees ) were corrected to 9.6 degrees (0.6 degrees approximately 28.2 degrees ), the average angle was 8.7 degrees (0.3 degrees approximately 27.2 degrees ), and the contrast between preoperative and postoperative showed obvious differences (P <0.001). The average recovery rate of A group was 77.6% (55.3% approximately 100%), B group was 64.3% (22.9% approximately 100%). The average postoperative Cobb angle of A group was 9.9 degrees (0.3 degrees approximately 27.2 degrees ), B group was 8.6 degrees (0.6 degrees approximately 19.8 degrees ) (P >0.05).
Conclusions: 
As a promising minimally invasive surgery, balloon kyphoplasty can provide early relief of pain and improve the function as well as spinal alignment in treatment of painful compression fracture owing to recovering the vertebral height and Cobb angle of the vertebral body. Single balloon-inflated kyphoplasty can improve VCFs as double balloon.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To analyze the percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) data statistically to predict the bone cement volume (CV).
Methods: 
Retrospective analysis of 93 patients with 154 vertebrae of osteoporotic vertebra compressed fracture, who received PKP from January 2012 to December 2013 in Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University. All procedures were bilateral and non-high-pressure polymethyl methacrylate injection. The balloon volume (BV), balloon peak pressure (Pmax), CV and the ratio of Pmax to BV (P/BV) were documented. The data was analyzed by correlation analysis and linear regression analysis to reveal the correlation between BV and CV.
Results: 
Seven vertebrae had bone cement leakage, no intraspinal leakage, no neuro-deficit. Visual analogue scale was 0-2 of all patients on 3 d postoperation. The data of 147 vertebrae without leakage: BV was 2.1-6.3 ml, Pmax was 130-359 psi, CV was 2.8-8.5 ml, and the ratio of Pmax to BV (P/BV) was 25-263 psi/ml. The data analysis showed there was no high correlation between BV and CV as one group (R<0.75). However if divided the data into three groups by the value of P/BV, group A (P/BV<100), group B (100≤P/BV<200), group C (P/BV≥200), there was high correlation and linear relationship between BV and CV in each group (R>0.75, P<0.01). CV was 0.9-1.1 times of BV in group A; CV was 1.4-1.6 times of BV in group B; and CV was 2.0-2.2 times of BV in group C.
Conclusion: 
CV is predictable by the BV and the ratio of Pmax to BV. It can reduce the rate of the leakage, and also can prevent the unsatisfactory results by insufficient bone cement volume.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the risk factors of cement leakage in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
Methods: 
Between March 2011 and March 2012, 98 patients with single level OVCF were treated by PVP, and the clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. There were 13 males and 85 females, with a mean age of 77.2 years (range, 54-95 years). The mean disease duration was 43 days (range, 15-120 days), and the mean T score of bone mineral density (BMD) was -3.8 (range, -6.7- -2.5). Bilateral transpedicular approach was used in all the patients. The patients were divided into cement leakage group and no cement leakage group by occurrence of cement leakage based on postoperative CT. Single factor analysis was used to analyze the difference between 2 groups in T score of BMD, operative level, preoperative anterior compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative middle compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative sagittal Cobb angle of operative vertebrae, preoperative vertebral body wall incompetence, cement volume, and volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body. All relevant factors were introduced to logistic regression analysis to analyze the risk factors of cement leakage.
Results: 
All procedures were performed successfully. The mean operation time was 40 minutes (range, 30-50 minutes), and the mean volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body was 24.88% (range, 7.84%-38.99%). Back pain was alleviated significantly in all the patients postoperatively. All patients were followed up with a mean time of 8 months (range, 6-12 months). Cement leakage occurred in 49 patients. Single factor analysis showed that there were significant differences in the volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body and preoperative vertebral body wall incompetence between 2 groups (P < 0.05), while no significant difference in T score of BMD, operative level, preoperative anterior compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative middle compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative sagittal Cobb angle of operative vertebrae, and cement volume (P > 0.05). The logistic regression analysis showed that the volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body (P < 0.05) and vertebral body wall incompetence (P < 0.05) were the risk factors for occurrence of cement leakage.
Conclusion: 
The volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body and vertebral body wall incompetence are risk factors of cement leakage in PVP for OVCF. Cement leakage is easy to occur in operative level with vertebral body wall incompetence and high volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body.},

  abstract={Objective The incidence of bone fractures rapidly increases as people age, mostly due to bone loss resulting from osteoporosis. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates of repeat vertebroplasty in osteoporotic patients treated with or without zoledronic acid (ZOL) infusion following initial vertebroplasty. Research design and methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of osteoporotic patients who underwent vertebroplasty from June 2009 to June 2012. Patients with existing vertebral fracture(s) were retrospectively divided into two groups according to whether or not they received zoledronic acid infusion after initial vertebroplasty. Zoledronic acid infusion was intravenously administered once a year for three consecutive years, as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. The primary efficacy variable was the number of patients requiring repeat vertebroplasty procedures after the initial surgery due to subsequent vertebral fractures. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk ratios of repeat vertebroplasty between these two groups. Results A total of 1646 patients, including 456 males and 1190 females (age range: 65-89 years), were enrolled. Compared to the 1595 patients who did not receive osteoporosis medication, the 51 patients treated with zoledronic acid infusion demonstrated a significantly lower rate of repeat vertebroplasty. In the ZOL-treated group, only 4% of the patients (2/51) required a second vertebroplasty, compared to 13% (206/1595) in the non-ZOL-treated group (p = 0.032). Conclusions The results indicate that osteoporotic patients who undergo vertebroplasty are significantly less likely to require reoperation if treated with zoledronic acid infusion. However, since the number of male patients in the ZOL-treated group was limited, and since Taiwan's National Health System program does not cover the cost of receiving zoledronic acid infusions for male patients, the conclusion seems to be less certain for male osteoporotic patients.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To explore the correlative factors affecting the complications resulting from cement leakage after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures (OVCF).
Methods: 
From February 2005 to October 2008, 71 patients with OVCF were treated by PKP and were retrospectively analyzed. There were 16 males and 55 females, and the average age was 71.5 years (range, 52-91 years). The average duration of disease was 5.7 months (range, 1-11 months). A total of 171 vertebra were involved in fracture including 19 cases of single vertebral fractures, 21 cases of double vertebral fractures, 20 cases of three vertebral fractures, and 11 cases of more than three vertebral fractures. All the treated vertebra were divided into acute (86 vertebra) or subacute (85 vertebra) state based on changes in MRI signal intensity. There was no radiculopathy or myelopathy. The average injected cement volume was 4.6 mL (range, 1.5-6.5 mL). The treatment efficacy was assessed by observing the change in anterior and middle vertebral column height, Cobb angle, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry functional score at preoperation, 3 days after operation and last follow-up. The patients were divided into cement leakage group and no cement leakage group. All the complications were recorded, and then the correlative factors affecting the complications were analyzed.
Results: 
All the cases had rapid and significant improvement in back pain following PKP. All patients were followed up for 14 months (range, 7-18 months). There was no cement extravasation resulting in radiculopathy or myelopathy. Four patients (5.63%) had lung-related complications. During the follow-up, 9 recurrence vertebral fractures were observed in 6 patients (8.45%). The anterior and middle vertebral column height, Cobb angle, VAS and Oswestry score were significantly improved when compared with preoperation (P < 0.05). Cement leakage occurred in 17 (9.94%) vertebral bodies; of 17 cases, the cement leaked into the paravertebral space in 7 cases, intervertebral space in 6 cases, channel of needling insertion in 3 cases, and spinal canal in 1 case. Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in preoperative anterior and middle vertebral column height, injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence between the cement leakage group and no cement leakage group. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in preoperative Cobb angle, freshness of vertebral fracture, location of operative vertebrae and operative approach between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the injected cement volume [odds ratio (OR)=3.105, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.674-5.759, P < 0.01] and vertebral body wall incompetence (OR = 11.960, 95% CI = 3.512-40.729, P < 0.01) were the predominant variable associated with the complications resulted from cement leakage.
Conclusion: 
The injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence were the factors affecting the complications. The improvement of surgical technique is the capital factor that may reduce the complications in the PKP.},

To analyse the correlative factors of secondary vertebral fracture after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) at different levels (adjacent and/or nonadjacent levels).
Methods: 
Between December 2002 and May 2008, 84 patients with OVCF were treated with PKP, and the clinical data were analysed retrospectively. There were 11 males and 73 females with an average age of 70.1 years (range, 55-90 years). All patients were followed up 24-96 months (mean, 38 months). Secondary vertebral fracture occurred in 12 cases at 3-52 months after PKP (secondary fracture group), no secondary fracture in 72 cases (control group) at over 24 months. The preoperative bone mineral density, postoperative vertebral height compression rate, postoperative Cobb angle, amount of injected bone cement per vertebra, puncture pathway (uni- or bilateral puncture), age, gender, number of fracture segment, and cement intradiscal leakage were compared between 2 groups to find correlative factors of secondary vertebral fractures.

  abstract={Study design: 
A multicenter, randomized, controlled, cost-effectiveness analysis.
Objective: 
To assess the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) compared with standard medical treatment (control) in patients with acute/subacute (<3 months) vertebral compression fracture (VCF) due to osteoporosis.
Summary of background data: 
Patients with a VCF due to osteoporosis are common and will increase in number in an aging population, putting a substantial strain on health care. Selected patients may benefit from stabilizing the fracture with cement through BKP, a minimally invasive procedure. BKP has been reported to give good short-time clinical results, and economic modeling has suggested that the procedure could be cost-effective after 2 years compared with standard treatment.
Methods: 
Hospitalized patients with back pain due to VCF were randomized to BKP or to control using a computer-generated random list. All costs associated with VCF and cost-effectiveness were reported primarily from the perspective of society. We used EQ-5D to assess quality of life (QoL). The accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs/QALY gained were assessed using intention to treat.
Results: 
Between February 2003 and December 2005, a total of 63 out of 67 Swedish patients were analyzed: BKP (n = 32) and control (n = 31). Societal cost per patient for BKP was SEK 160,017 (SD = 151,083) = €16,668 (SD = 15,735), and for control SEK 84,816 (SD = 40,954) = €8835 (SD = 4266), a significant difference of 75,198 (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 16,037-120,104) = €7833 (95% CI = 1671-12,511). The accumulated difference in QALYs was 0.085 (95% CI = -0.132 to 0.306) in favor of BKP. Cost/QALY gained using BKP was SEK 884,682 = €92,154 and US $134,043.
Conclusion: 
In this randomized controlled trial, it was not possible to demonstrate that BKP was cost-effective compared with standard medical treatment in patients treated for an acute/subacute vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis. However, sensitivity analysis indicated a certain degree of uncertainty, which needs to be considered.},

  abstract={The treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures has changed substantially since the introduction of vertebroplasty in the mid-1980s and balloon kyphoplasty in the late 1990s. Both procedures were widely accepted with the vertebral fractures treated reaching 150,000 per annum in 2009 prior to the publication of 2 randomized controlled trials comparing vertebroplasty with a sham treatment published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2009. Since then, there has been a flood of information on vertebral augmentation and balloon kyphoplasty. It is worth evaluating this information especially because it relates to current recommendations that are often followed blindly by medical and administrative groups unfamiliar with either the procedure or the high level of evidence surrounding vertebral augmentation. To streamline the evaluation of some current recommendations, we limited the analysis to the recommendations found on UpToDate.com. This Web site is an evidence-based, peer-reviewed source of information available for patients, doctors, health insurance companies, and population-based medical decision-making.},

  abstract={Vertebral compression fractures constitute a major health care problem, not only because of their high incidence but also due to both direct and indirect consequences on health-related quality of life and health care expenditures. The mainstay of management for symptomatic vertebral compression fractures is targeted medical therapy, including analgesics, bed rest, external fixation, and rehabilitation. However, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain types of analgesics can be poorly tolerated by elderly patients, and surgical fixation often fails due to the poor quality of osteoporotic bone. Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are two minimally invasive percutaneous surgical approaches that have recently been developed for the management of symptomatic vertebral compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive review of the literature and conduct a meta-analysis to compare clinical outcomes of pain relief and function, radiographic outcomes of the restoration of anterior vertebral height and kyphotic angles, and subsequent complications associated with these two techniques.},

  abstract={Objective: 
This study was performed to provide an overview of the current practice of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in Germany. All surgical departments were evaluated for indications, experience and expertise, and the complications.
Methods: 
Questionnaires were mailed to 1330 surgical departments.
Results: 
A total of 582 (43.76%) surveys were returned; 257 departments perform neither BKP nor PVP. Osteoporotic compression fractures and to a lesser extent hemangiomas and metastasis were treated. About 30% of the BKP users consider traumatic vertebral fractures in young patients as an indication, 76% of the respondents perform further spinal surgery, and 71% of the users operate within the first 2 weeks. For both interventions cement leakage is the most common complication.
Conclusion: 
Nationwide kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are widely used by surgeons. The number of users as well as the annual number of cases in each center are increasing continuously. The partially incomplete present state of the studies must be validated by future high-quality, randomized studies.},

  abstract={Object: 
Vertebral body (VB) deformities have been associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this retrospective, consecutive single-center cohort study was to determine the effectiveness of kyphoplasty in reducing morphometrically defined VB deformity, including deformity shape types (wedge, biconcave, or crush) and grade (severity).
Methods: 
The authors identified 100 patients (70% women; mean age 76.1 years) in whom 138 vertebral fractures (T-4 through L-5; mean fracture age 2.7 months) that were treated between May 2000 and December 2001 were radiographically evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up visit (mean follow-up duration 16.9 months). Fractures were divided into four groups by level: T5-9 (28 fractures), T10-12 (41), L1-2 (42), and L3-5 (27). Anterior, midline, posterior, and predicted posterior vertebral heights for fractured and adjacent unfractured reference vertebrae were measured on lateral radiographs. The deformity type and grade were mathematically defined using the modified methods of McCloskey-Kanis and Black. The total number of deformities decreased from 89.9 to 53.6% after kyphoplasty (p < 0.0001). The number of fractures with wedge, biconcave, or crush deformity decreased 22.5, 59.1, and 67.7% (p = 0.0699, p = 0.0222, p = 0.0007), respectively. The number of the more severe Grade 2 deformities decreased (79.7 to 37.0%; p < 0.0001). Kyphoplasty effectively decreased the number of deformed fractures in all vertebral level groups (T5-9, p = 0.0023; T10-12, p = 0.0105; L1-2, p < 0.0001; L3-5, p = 0.0028).
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty resulted in significant normalization of vertebral shapes in patients with symptomatic vertebral fractures, reducing the number and severity of deformed fractures postoperatively.},

Literature review concerning pulmonary embolism of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) material following percutaneous vertebroplasty and a report on 2 new cases.
Objective: 
To inform clinicians about delayed clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism of polymethylmethacrylate material after percutaneous vertebroplasty, pathophysiology, precautions, and therapeutic management of this complication.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimal invasive intervention used to treat vertebral fractures, which yields good therapeutic results and rarely produces complications. Nevertheless, serious complications may occur. Pulmonary PMMA embolism, which has been recently reported in some cases, is one of these.
Methods and results: 
We report on 2 cases of pulmonary embolism of PMMA material after percutaneous vertebroplasty. In the case of a 45-year-old female patient, symptoms of pulmonary embolism arose with a delay of 3 days following percutaneous vertebroplasty. A therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, Enoxaparin, enabled recovery from pulmonary failure. The second case occurred without detection of any cement leakage into the paravertebral venous system, neither intraoperatively nor perioperatively. The existence of PMMA in pulmonary vessels was detected 1 year later and remained asymptomatic.
Conclusion: 
These 2 cases allow us to conclude that the risk of pulmonary embolism of PMMA might be underestimated. We propose routine chest radiograph following every vertebroplasty, in order to detect pulmonary PMMA embolism and thereby prevent serious delayed cardiopulmonary failures.},

  abstract={Background: 
The cross-section of thoracolumbar vertebral body is kidney-shaped with depressed posterior boundary. The anterior wall of the vertebral canal is separated from the posterior wall of the vertebral body on the lateral X-ray image. This study was designed to determine the sagittal distance between the anterior border of the vertebral canal and the posterior border of the vertebral body (DBCV) and to analyze the potential role of DBCV in the estimation of cement leakage during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
Methods: 
We retrospectively recruited 233 patients who had osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and were treated with PVP or PKP. Computed tomography images of T11-L2 normal vertebrae were measured to obtain DBCV. The distance from cement to the posterior wall of the vertebral body (DCPW) of thoracolumbar vertebrae was measured from C-arm images. The selected vertebrae were divided into two groups according to DCPW, with the fracture levels, fracture grades and leakage rates of the two groups compared. A relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine whether the DCPW difference can be used to estimate the degree of cement leakage. The data were processed by statistical software SPSS version 21.0 using independent sample t-test and Chi-square tests.
Results: 
The maximum DBCV was 6.40 mm and the average DBCV was 3.74 ± 0.95 mm. DBCV appeared to be longer in males than in females, but the difference was not statistically significant. The average DCPW of type-B leakage vertebrae (2.59 ± 1.20 mm) was shorter than that of other vertebrae (7.83 ± 2.38 mm, P < 0.001). The leakage rate of group DCPW ≤6.40 mm was lower than that of group DCPW >6.40 mm for type-C and type-S, but much higher for type-B. ROC curve revealed that DCPW only has a predictive value for type-B leakage (area under the curve: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.95-0.99, P < 0.001), and when the cut-off value was 4.05 mm, the diagnostic sensitivity and the specificity were 94.87% and 93.02%, respectively.
Conclusions: 
Depression of the thoracolumbar posterior vertebral body may be informative for the estimation of cement location on C-arm images. To reduce type-B leakage, DCPW should be made longer than DBCV on C-arm images for safety during PVP or PKP.},

  abstract={Vertebral cement augmentation can restore the stiffness and strength of a fractured vertebra and relieve chronic pain. Previous finite element analysis, biomechanical tests and clinical studies have indirectly associated new adjacent vertebral fractures following augmentation to altered loading. The aim of this repeated measures in situ biomechanical study was to determine the changes in the adjacent and augmented endplate deformation following cement augmentation of human cadaveric functional spine units (FSU) using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The surrounding soft tissue and posterior elements of 22 cadaveric human FSU were removed. FSU were assigned to two groups, control (n = 8) (loaded on day 1 and day 2) and augmented (n = 14) (loaded on day 1, augmented 20% cement fill, and loaded on day 2). The augmented group was further subdivided into a prophylactic augmentation group (n = 9), and vertebrae which spontaneously fractured during loading on day 1 (n = 5). The FSU were axially loaded (200, 1,000, 1,500-2,000 N) within a custom made radiolucent, saline filled loading device. At each loading step, FSUs were scanned using the micro-CT. Endplate heights were determined using custom software. No significant increase in endplate deformation following cement augmentation was noted for the adjacent endplate (P > 0.05). The deformation of the augmented endplate was significantly reduced following cement augmentation for both the prophylactic and fracture group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). Endplate deformation of the controls showed no statistically significant differences between loading on day 1 and day 2. A linear relationship was noted between the applied compressive load and endplate deflection (R (2) = 0.58). Evidence of significant endplate deformation differences between unaugmented and augmented FSU, while evident for the augmented endplate, was not present for the adjacent endplate. This non-invasive micro-CT method may also be useful to investigate endplate failure, and parameters that predict vertebral failure.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the clinical efficacy of 3 approaches of vertebroplasty in the treatment of severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
Twenty-five patients with severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were observed, whose average age was 72 years with average disease history of 12 days and average compression of the affected vertebral bodies of 73%. The patients were divided into 3 groups for 3 different fracture types according to Rao's classification of osteoporotic vertebral structure and deformity, namely wedge type (group A, n= 12), biconcave type (group B, n= 7) and crush type (group C, n=6). Unipedicular approach was adopted in group A, far lateral bipedicular approach in group B, and posterior wall vertebroplasty and pedicle screw fixation in group C. The average follow-up time was 1 year. Visual analog scale (VAS), analgesic use and the mobility were measured in the patients preoperatively and 3 days (7 days in group C) and 6 months after the operation, respectively, and the success rates and complications were observed.
Results: 
All the surgical procedures were successful. The average operation time was 35 min in group A, 50 min in group B, and 2 h in group C. The average volume of cement injected into each vertebral body was 2.0 ml. The average blood loss was 30 ml in groups A and B, and 600 ml in group C. The procedure increased mobility and decreased analgesic use. VAS was decreased by a mean of 4.8 in Group A, 6.2 in group B 3 days after the operation and 5.4 in group C 7 days postoperatively, and remained stable till 6 months after the operation (P<0.01). Cement extravasation occurred in 9 cases, cement in the vertebral canal in 2 cases with transient neurological symptoms, and cement extravasation in the intervertebral space and the anterior space of the vertebral bodies took place in 5 and 2 cases, respectively. No neurological complications were observed.
Conclusion: 
Different types of severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures require management with different approaches of vertebroplasty for adequate filling of the remaining vertebral body, which provides significant pain relief with wider indications.},

In study 1, 14 patients received initially 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen, which was replaced 90 min after incision by propofol 6 mg kg-1 h-1. This substitution resulted in a significant increase in mean P1N1 amplitude from 1.01 (SD 1.14) microV to 2.61 (2.17) microV (P less than 0.01), while amplitudes of later peaks were unaffected. Latencies of peaks N1, P2 and N2 increased after the substitution. In study 2, 30 patients undergoing spinal surgery received either alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia (group I, n = 15) or alfentanil-propofol anaesthesia (group II, n = 15). P1N1 amplitude was significantly greater in group II (3.24 (1.08) microV) than in group I (1.64 (0.97) microV) (P less than 0.01). Latencies of peaks P2 and N2 were of significantly greater duration in group II than in group I. Because early cortical PTN-SEP peaks were preserved better during alfentanil-propofol anaesthesia we conclude that this combination may be a suitable alternative to alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia, when spinal cord function monitoring with PTN-SEP is indicated.},

We outline the case management (includes 30-month follow-up) and review the treatment recommendations. The patient presented with an unstable C5 pathologic fracture caused by C immitis. After corpectomy and stabilization of the cervical spine along with antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and oral fluconazole, he developed multiple complications. This case illustrates some of the potential pitfalls in managing spinal osteomyelitis caused by C immitis and the need for continuous medical therapy after surgical treatment.},

  abstract={Surgical decompression of the spinal canal is presently accepted worldwide as the method of treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures with neurological deficit in the belief that neurological recovery may be produced or enhanced. Our clinical and laboratory experience, however, indicates that the paralysis occurs at the moment of injury and is not related to the position of the fragments of the fracture on subsequent imaging. Since the preoperative geometry of the fracture may be of no relevance, our hypothesis, backed by more than two decades of operative experience, is that alteration of the canal by 'surgical clearance' does not affect the neurological outcome. We have reviewed the existing world literature in an attempt to find evidence-based justification for the variety of surgical procedures used in the management of these fractures. We retrieved 275 publications on the management of burst fractures of which 60 met minimal inclusion criteria and were analysed more closely. Only three papers were prospective studies; the remainder were retrospective descriptive analyses. None of the 60 articles included control groups. The design of nine studies was sufficiently similar to allow pooling of their results, which failed to establish a significant advantage of surgical over non-surgical treatment as regards neurological improvement. Significant complications were reported in 75% of papers, including neurological deterioration. Surgical treatment for burst fracture in the belief that neurological improvement can be achieved is not justified, although surgery may still occasionally be indicated for structural reasons. This information should not be withheld from the patients.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Normal progression of osteoporosis or the rigid reinforcement of the fractured vertebral body with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement is being discussed as a cause for adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether augmentation with low stiffness cement can decrease the risk of adjacent-level fractures in low-quality bone.
Methods: 
Eighteen female osteoporotic lumbar specimens (L1-L5) were harvested and divided into three groups according to bone mineral density: (I) native; (II) PMMA; (III) modified PMMA (lower stiffness). For the PMMA and modified PMMA groups, a compression fracture was first mechanically induced in L3, and then the fracture received vertebroplasty treatment. The cement stiffness reduction of the modified PMMA group was achieved via an addition of 8 mL of serum to the typical PMMA base. All specimens were exposed to cyclic loading (4 Hz) and a stepwise increasing applied peak force. Cement stiffness was tested according to ISO 5833.
Results: 
A 51% decrease in cement stiffness was achieved in the modified PMMA group (954 ± 141 vs. 1,937 ± 478 MPa, p < 0.001). Fatigue fracture force (the force level during cyclic loading at which the deformation experienced a sudden increase; FFF) was significantly affected by bone quality (r (2) = 0.39, p = 0.006) and by the initial fracture force (the force necessary to create the initial fracture in L3 prior to augmentation; r (2) = 0.82, p < 0.001). Using initial fracture force as a covariate, the FFF of the modified PMMA group (1,764 ± 49 N) was significantly higher than in the PMMA group (1,544 ± 55 N; p = 0.03).
Conclusions: 
A possible method to reduce adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty in patients with reduced bone quality could be the use of a lower modulus cement. Therefore, mixing cement with biocompatible fluids could prove useful to tailor cement properties in the operating theater.},

Twenty-eight consecutive patients had 52 symptomatic osteoporotic VCFs treated with kyphoplasty; 5 of these patients were treated in two sessions. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for back pain, a Visual Analog Scale for pain assessment, a patients' satisfaction scale, and medication usage served to evaluate the clinical outcomes. All these variables improved significantly in both groups, and more so in the acute group, but the difference was most often not significant. Vertebral height, local kyphosis angle, global sagittal alignment and dynamic fracture mobility significantly improved in both groups (except global sagittal alignment), and again more so in the acute group (except global sagittal alignment); the difference between groups was significant regarding radiological variables, except global sagittal alignment. Timing of kyphoplasty certainly matters, as the clinical and radiological outcomes were mostly better in acute fractures than in chronic fractures, which somehow responded satisfactorily. Controlled studies (kyphoplasty versus natural history) are needed to establish the real value of the procedure.},

  abstract={Background: 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether vertebral augmentation technology increases the occurrence of adjacent vertebral fractures in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Materials and methods: 
Databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library, were retrieved via PRISMA covering 1987 to 2015. The number of patients who suffered from adjacent secondary vertebral fractures was calculated. A meta-analysis, using indexes of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), was conducted with STATA software. Subgroup investigations were conducted according to the operation methods and the duration of observation. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also evaluated.
Results: 
Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met our inclusion criteria. Our results indicated there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence rate of adjacent vertebral fractures between manipulation of vertebral augmentation and non-surgical treatment (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.58-1.37). Neither subgroup investigations based on selection of operation nor duration of follow-up time showed marked differences. A sensitivity analysis did not identify specific trails seriously deflected. No obvious publication bias was identified.
Conclusion: 
Despite various limitations in the present study, our data demonstrated that using vertebral augmentation was not related to increasing incidence of subsequent adjacent vertebral fractures.},

Although the procedure appears to provide dramatic pain relief, it is not without complications. The primary point of discussion in this paper is whether vertebroplasty predisposes patients to the development of additional vertebral fractures, at a rate higher than that seen in the absence of vertebroplasty. To date there remains no definitive answer to this question. There is, however, a significant body of data available in the literature that relates to this issue. This review explores and attempts to synthesize the data both supporting and refuting a relationship between vertebroplasty and the development of subsequent fractures.},

  abstract={Object: 
The use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement by percutaneous injection in cases requiring vertebroplasty provides pain relief in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A retrospective study was performed to assess what caused PMMA cement to leak into the epidural space and to determine if this leakage caused any changes in its therapeutic benefits.
Methods: 
Polymethylmethacrylate was injected into 347 vertebral compression fractures in 159 patients. The cement leaked into the epidural space in 92 (26.5%) of 347 treated vertebrae in 64 (40.3%) of the 159 patients, as demonstrated on postoperative computerized tomography scanning. Epidural leakage of PMMA cement occurred more often when injected above the level of T-7 (p = 0.001) than below. The larger the volume of PMMA injected the higher the incidence of epidural leakage (p = 0.03). Using an injector also increased epidural leakage (p = 0.045). The position of the needle tip within the vertebral body and the pattern of venous drainage did not affect epidural leakage of the cement. Leakage of PMMA into the epidural space reduced the pain relief expected after vertebroplasty. The immediate postoperative visual analog scale scores were higher (and therefore reflective of less pain relief) in patients in whom epidural PMMA leakage occurred (p = 0.009). Three months postoperatively, the authors found the highest number of patients presenting with pain relief, including those in the group with epidural leakage, and at this follow-up stage there were no significant differences between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
The authors found that epidural leakage of PMMA after percutaneous vertebroplasty was dose dependent. The larger amount of injected PMMA, the higher the incidence of leakage. Injecting vertebral levels above T-7 also increased the incidence of epidural leakage. Epidural leakage of PMMA may attenuate only the immediate therapeutic effects of vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective trial of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF).
Objective: 
To investigate the relationship between intraosseous clefts and bone marrow perfusion using DCE-MRI in patients with osteoporotic VCF before vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
The nonhealing cleft may be responsible for persistent pain and progressive vertebral collapse after acute injury. If localized kyphosis increased, there is risk of neuropathy appearing as a complication. Even after receiving vertebroplasty, it was reported to be at increased risk for subsequent cemented vertebral refracture and new adjacent vertebral fractures. DCE -MRI has been used for the evaluation of bone marrow perfusion. However, there are few reports on the evaluation of osteoporotic VCF and intraosseous cleft formation.
Materials: 
Forty subjects referred for evaluation of VCF underwent DCE-MRI. Bone marrow perfusion, as measured using the DCE-MRI time-intensity curve from a noninjured vertebrae was developed using two distinct parameters including peak enhancement ratio and enhancement slope. The ratio of the well-enhanced and the poorly enhanced zone of each injured vertebra were calculated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between baseline clinical factors, parameters of DCE-MRI and presence or absence of intraosseous clefts.
Results: 
Twenty-nine injured vertebrae (72%) had intraosseous clefts. Lower PER of the noninjured vertebrae was associated with higher poorly enhanced zone ratio of the injured vertebrae (γ = -0.362, P = 0.017). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified only lower PER (hazard ratio, 0.000; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.096; P = 0.009) was associated with the presence of intraosseous clefts. A peak enhancement ratio value less than 0.57 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90% for predicting intraosseous clefts.
Conclusion: 
In patients with osteoporotic VCF before vertebroplasty, decreased bone marrow perfusion, as measured by DCE-MRI, was associated with intraosseous cleft formation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the efficiency of manual reduction combined with uni-lateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
Methods: 
Between May 2005 and May 2009, the manual reduction combined with uni-lateral PKP was applied to treat 42 patients with OVCF (group A), and the simple uni-lateral PKP was applied to treat 43 patients with OVCF (group B) at the same period. The visual analogue scale (VAS), the vertebral height, and the Cobb angle were determined before operation, and at 3 days and 6 months after operation. In group A, there were 6 males and 36 females aged 59-93 years (76.5 years on average) with an average disease duration of 7 days (range, 3 hours to 21 days); 27 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 31 segments of lumbar vertebrae were involved, including 15 segments at mild degree, 38 segments at moderate degree, and 5 segments at severe degree according to degree classification system of compression fractures of Zoarski and Peh. In group B, there were 9 males and 34 females aged 54-82 years (75.3 years on average) with an average disease duration of 7 days (range, 1 hour to 20 days); 26 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 35 segments of lumbar vertebrae were involved, including 21 segments at mild degree, 36 segments at moderate degree, and 4 segments at severe degree according to degree classification system of compression fractures of Zoarski and Peh. There were no significant difference (P > 0.05) in sex, age, affected site, degree, and disease duration between 2 groups.
Results: 
There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in operative time, blood loss, or injected cement volume between 2 groups. No serious complication or death occurred in 2 groups. Cement leakage was observed in 4 cases (9.5%) of group A and in 5 cases (11.6%) of group B. The VAS scores after operation significantly decreased in 2 groups (P < 0.01). At 3 days and 6 months after operation, the VAS scores in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P < 0.05). The postoperative compression rates of affected vertebral body in 2 groups significantly decreased (P < 0.01). The compression rates of affected vertebral body at 3 days and 6 months after operation, and the height recovery rate at 3 days after operation in group A were superior to those in group B (P < 0.05). The postoperative Cobb angles in 2 groups were significantly diminished (P < 0.01). The Cobb angles at 3 days and 6 months after operation, and the recovery rate at 3 days after operation in group A were superior to those in group B (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The clinical efficiency of the manual reduction combined with unilateral PKP is superior to that of simple uni-lateral PKP in treatment of severe OVCF.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To retrospectively assess the optimal operating time for kyphoplasty as far as the cement leakage during kyphoplasty is concerned.
Materials and methods: 
One hundred and six patients with a total of 117 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were enrolled in our study. According to the time of kyphoplasty, they were divided into two groups: group 1 (early operation group, who received the operation within 14 days after fracture, n=46) and group 2 (delayed operation group, who received the operation between 15 and 28 days after fracture, n=71). Preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were compared 3 days after surgery within each group and between the two groups. The radiographic outcomes were evaluated by the restoration rate (RR) of the treated vertebrae. The outcome of cement leakage was assessed after surgery using X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans. Leaks of cement were classified into three types: those via the basivertebral vein (type B), via the segmental vein (type S) and through a cortical defect (type C).
Results: 
The mean VAS and ODI scores decreased significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery in each group, as did the RR (p>0.05). There was no significant difference postoperatively on VAS and ODI scores (p>0.05) between the two groups. However, significant differences were observed postoperatively on RR (p=0.045) and vertebrae with leakage (p=0.038). In addition, there was a significant difference on leakage site of type C between the two groups (p=0.032).
Conclusion: 
Both early and delayed operations of kyphoplasty can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes for osteoporotic VCFs. The risk of cement leakage during kyphoplasty will decrease obviously in delayed operation; so delayed operation, perhaps 2 weeks after fracture, is more safe and optimal than early operation as far as cement leakage is concerned, especially for vertebrae with cortical defects. But early operation of kyphoplasty is more effective in vertebral height restoration.},

  abstract={Object: 
The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in American Spinal Injury Association motor score (AMS) in the 1st week after traumatic central cord syndrome (CCS) to identify predictors of improved early outcome in patients treated with early versus delayed surgical intervention.
Methods: 
All patients presenting to a regional spinal cord injury center between January 2004 and June 2009 were queried for those with a diagnosis of CCS. Patients treated conservatively were excluded. A prospectively maintained spinal cord injury database was used to track AMS throughout each patient's hospitalization. Hospital records provided information regarding demographics, presenting neurological examination, imaging findings, comorbidities, timing and nature of surgical procedures, and length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were separated into those who underwent early surgery, within 1 day of presentation (early group), and those who underwent surgery on a delayed basis (delayed group). Differences between groups were analyzed using the Student t-test and chi-square test. Predictors of outcome were identified using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression.
Results: 
Of 426 patients in the database, 80 (18.8%) were diagnosed as having CCS, and 68 of them ultimately underwent surgical decompression. Nineteen (28%) of 68 patients underwent surgery within 1 day of presentation (early group) while the remaining 49 patients (72%) underwent surgery on a delayed basis (delayed group). The mean age in the early group was significantly younger than that of the delayed group (52 vs 59 years, p = 0.049). Other characteristics were similar between groups including sex, proportion of patients with cord edema on MRI (44% early vs 55% delayed, p = 0.47), and proportion of patients with cervical fracture (26% early vs 28% delayed, p = 0.98). Patients in the early group presented with an AMS of 62.5 versus 70.0 for the delayed group (p = 0.36). No difference in the change in AMS was seen at 7 days between the early group (-2.9 points) and the delayed group (-4.2 points) (p = 0.34). Additionally, the number of patients who had early improvement was similar between the early and delayed groups (50% vs. 48%, respectively, p = 0.94). Neither time in the ICU (3.4 vs. 3.4 days, p = 0.84) nor the overall LOS (10.5 vs 12.5 days, p = 0.59) was different in the early versus delayed groups, respectively. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression demonstrated early surgery was not associated with change in AMS or AMS at Day 7. Age was identified as the only significant predictor of change in AMS and had a negative effect (coefficient = -0.34, p = 0.025).
Conclusions: 
Early treatment of patients with CCS remains controversial. Although some long-term neurological recovery is expected in patients with a CCS, surgeons and patients should not expect early neurological improvement with or without early operative intervention.},

  abstract={Background: 
Among the various treatments of neurologically involved unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, the combination of anterior and posterior instrumentation provides the most stable reconstruction. However, the use of both approaches on a trauma patient may increase the morbidity. This study is a retrospective matched cohort study to evaluate the advantages of a single stage posterior approach for spinal canal decompression in combination with circumferential reconstruction by comparing the clinical and radiographic results.
Methods: 
From March 2005 to September 2009, patients with matched type spinal fracture, ages at surgery, and involved levels in our institute underwent either a single stage posterior approach (group one, n = 12) or traditional combined approach (group two, n = 14) for spinal canal decompression and circumferential reconstruction were reviewed. Pre- and post-operative X-ray flms were reviewed and changes in Cobb angle of thoracolumbar spine were documented. Intra-operative, post-operative, and general complications were registered.
Results: 
The mean follow-up was (27.7 ± 9.6) months (range, 14 to 56 months) in group one and (29.2 ± 7.4) months (range, 20 to 60 months) in group two (P > 0.05). The mean operation time was 214 minutes (range, 186 ± 327 minutes) in group one and 284 minutes (range, 219 ± 423 minutes) in group two (P < 0.05). The average volume of intraoperative blood loss was 1856 ml (range, 1250 ± 3480 ml) in group one and 2453 ml (range, 1600 ± 3680 ml) in group two (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the groups one and two in average vertebral body height loss at the injured level and the average Cobb angle in sagittal plane before and immediately after surgery. Postoperatively, there was an epidural hematoma in one patient in group one and two patients in group two. Bony union after stabilization was obtained in all patients, without loosening or breakage of screws. Loss of correction (5°) was seen in 1 patient in group one at the 6th month owing to the subsidence of the Titanium mesh cages into the vertebra. In group two, totally four patients suffered respiratory-related complication, including pneumonia in two, severe atelectasis in one and pleural effusions in one. Importantly, there were no intraoperative or postoperative deaths in any group. All patients with incomplete neurologic deficits improved at least 1 Frankel grade.
Conclusion: 
Single-stage posterior vertebra resection in combination with circumferential reconstruction is a new option to manage severe thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Combined pelvic ring and acetabular injuries present a management challenge. The literature on this topic is scarce, with few outcomes studies available. This retrospective study assessed whether the incidence of postoperative displacement and loss of reduction is higher with combined injuries compared with isolated pelvic ring injuries and isolated acetabular fractures. The charts and radiographs of 33 patients with combined pelvic ring and acetabular fractures treated operatively during a 7-year period at a single institution were reviewed. Pelvic ring and acetabular displacements were measured during the early postoperative period and compared with final follow-up measurements (minimum 5 months after surgery). Measurements also were compared with those from isolated pelvic ring fractures (n=33) and isolated acetabular fractures (n=33). Groups were matched for injury pattern and were propensity-matched by age and Injury Severity Score. Patients with combined injuries and patients with isolated pelvic ring injuries had similar initial pelvic ring reductions on anteroposterior and outlet view radiographs. By final follow-up, the combined injury group had experienced significant additional pelvic ring displacement. The presence of combined injury was an independent risk factor for postoperative pelvic ring displacement. Initial postoperative acetabular displacement was higher in the combined injury group compared with the isolated acetabular fracture group (2.6±1.8 vs 1.1±1.1 mm). By final followup, apparent displacement decreased significantly for both groups. Patients with combined pelvic ring and acetabular fractures were more likely to have poorer acetabular reduction and additional displacement of the pelvic ring component during the postoperative period compared with patients with isolated injuries.

  abstract={Introduction: 
Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have shown to improve pain and functional outcome in cases with symptomatic vertebral fractures. Although restoration of the vertebral body height and kyphosis seemed to be easier with balloon kyphoplasty, it became clear that some of the correction achieved by the balloon is lost once it was deflated. Vertebral body stent was developed to eliminate this phenomenon. To our knowledge this is the first study in describing this technique in clinical settings.
Materials and methods: 
Seventeen patients with 20 fractured vertebral bodies were included. All fractures were Type A1.3 or A3.1 (incomplete burst). Information about pain (visual analogue scale-VAS) and function (Oswestry disability index-ODI) and vertebral body deformity (vertebral angle-VA) was recorded in a prospective way at regular intervals. Patients were classified into osteoporotic group (7 patients) and traumatic groups (10 patients, younger than 60 years).
Results: 
There were 6 male and 11 female patients with mean age of 58.1 years (31-88 years). Mean follow up was 12 months. The preoperative pain level showed a mean VAS score of 8.9 in osteoporotic group and 9.7 in traumatic group. Postoperatively, in osteoporotic group, mean VAS was 4.8 at 6 weeks, 4.0 at 6 months and 2.5 at 12 months compared with traumatic fracture group where it was 2.7 at 6 weeks, 2.2 at 6 months and 1.6 at 12 months. Mean ODI in osteoporotic group was 41.7% (14-58%) and in traumatic group it was 20.4% (6-33%). Mean vertebral body angle prior to surgery in osteoporotic group was 9.7 whilst postoperatively it was 5.2°; so the mean correction achieved was 4.5°. In traumatic group preoperative VA was 13° whilst postoperatively it was 5.7°; therefore the mean correction achieved was 7.3°. None of the patients lost reduction at their last follow up.
Conclusion: 
Vertebral body stenting leads to satisfactory improvement in pain, function and kyphosis correction in the treatment of osteoporotic and traumatic fractures. Anterior spinal column, especially the fragmented superior endplate is nicely reconstructed by the stent provided it is inserted accurately. With addition of posterior transpedicular instrumentation, indications for this technique may be wider covering some Type B and C fractures with similar vertebral body damage.},

  abstract={Study design: 
An in vitro biomechanical study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an optional sleeve on height restoration and compare it with the fracture reduction achieved by a commercially available inflatable bone tamp under simulated physiological load (110 N).
Summary of background data: 
Loss of reduction after bone tamp deflation before cement injection still remains a concern. The optional sleeve surrounds the bone tamp to help maintain height during the kyphoplasty procedure while filling the created cavity with bone cement on the contralateral side.
Methods: 
Eighteen osteoporotic vertebral bodies (VBs) (T11-L4) were alternately assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: group A: KYPHON (Kyphon Inc.) and group B: AFFIRM with sleeve (Globus Medical Inc.). The VBs were compressed axially at a rate of 5 mm/min until compressed to 40% of the initial anterior height. The fractured VBs then underwent kyphoplasty with cement augmentation while still maintaining load (110 N). The augmented VBs were then recompressed and anterior VB height (mm) and wedge angle (degrees) were measured initially after mechanically creating an anterior wedge fracture, and after repairing the compression fracture. The effect of kyphoplasty on vertebral height, kyphotic angle, cement volumes, and inflation pressures were compared between the treatment groups. Failure load (N) data were compared between intact and repaired VBs.
Results: 
Average percentage of lost VB height restored in group A was 30%, compared with 56% for group B. The mean changes in wedge angle were similar to those of vertebral height measurements. No significant difference in mean inflation pressures (group A: 175±37 psi; group B: 160±36 psi) were found between the 2 groups. Average percentage increase in failure load was 241% and 212% in groups A and B, respectively.
Conclusions: 
Some height restoration was observed using the commercially available bone tamp in fractured VBs under simulated physiological load. The use of an outer sleeve significantly enhanced height restoration compared with the inflatable bone tamp alone.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Augmentation of pedicle screws is recommended in selected indications (for instance: osteoporosis). Generally, there are two techniques for pedicle screw augmentation: inserting the screw in the non cured cement and in situ-augmentation with cannulated fenestrated screws, which can be applied percutaneously. Most of the published studies used an axial pull out test for evaluation of the pedicle screw anchorage. However, the loading and the failure mode of pullout tests do not simulate the cranio-caudal in vivo loading and failure mechanism of pedicle screws. The purpose of the present study was to assess the fixation effects of different augmentation techniques (including percutaneous cement application) and to investigate pedicle screw loosening under physiological cyclic cranio-caudal loading.
Methods: 
Each of the two test groups consisted of 15 vertebral bodies (L1-L5, three of each level per group). Mean age was 84.3 years (SD 7.8) for group 1 and 77.0 years (SD 7.00) for group 2. Mean bone mineral density was 53.3 mg/cm3 (SD 14.1) for group 1 and 53.2 mg/cm3 (SD 4.3) for group 2. 1.5 ml high viscosity PMMA bone cement was used for all augmentation techniques. For test group 1, pedicles on the right side of the vertebrae were instrumented with solid pedicle screws in standard fashion without augmentation and served as control group. Left pedicles were instrumented with cannulated screws (Viper cannulated, DePuy Spine) and augmented. For test group 2 pedicles on the left side of the vertebrae were instrumented with cannulated fenestrated screws and in situ augmented. On the right side solid pedicle screws were augmented with cement first technique. Each screw was subjected to a cranio-caudal cyclic load starting at 20-50 N with increasing upper load magnitude of 0.1 N per cycle (1 Hz) for a maximum of 5000 cycles or until total failure. Stress X-rays were taken after cyclic loading to evaluate screw loosening.
Results: 
Test group 1 showed a significant higher number of load cycles until failure for augmented screws compared to the control (4030 cycles, SD 827.8 vs. 1893.3 cycles, SD 1032.1; p < 0.001). Stress X-rays revealed significant less screw toggling for the augmented screws (5.2°, SD 5.4 vs. 16.1°, SD 5.9; p < 0.001). Test group 2 showed 3653.3 (SD 934) and 3723.3 (SD 560.6) load cycles until failure for in situ and cement first augmentation. Stress X-rays revealed a screw toggling of 5.1 (SD 1.9) and 6.6 (SD 4.6) degrees for in situ and cement first augmentation techniques (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Augmentation of pedicle screws in general significantly increased the number of load cycles and failure load comparing to the nonaugmented control group. For the augmentation technique (cement first, in situ augmented, percutaneously application) no effect could be exhibited on the failure of the pedicle screws. By the cranio-caudal cyclic loading failure of the pedicle screws occurred by screw cut through the superior endplate and the characteristic "windshield-wiper effect", typically observed in clinical practice, could be reproduced.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective study.
Summary of background data: 
Complications of the bone cement used in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures have received increasingly more attention, especially for bone cement volume.
Objective: 
The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the relationship between bone cement volume fraction and adjacent vertebral fracture (AVF) after unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
Materials and methods: 
Between 2006 and 2011, 495 patients with single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) were surgically treated by unilateral PKP and had completed 12-month follow-up in our hospital. According to the new OVCF, they were divided into 3 groups: AVF group, non-AVF group, and normal group (who were not new OVCF). On the basis of the value of the plain radiography, the cement volume fraction for the vertebral body was calculated, and cement leakage, bone mineral density, visual analog scale, and Cobb angle of preoperative and postoperative were analyzed.
Results: 
During the follow-up, 110 (22.2%) patients had new OVCF, and others were normal (n=385). Fifty-two cases were AVF and 58 were non-AVF. The cement volume fraction of AVF group, non-AVF group, and normal group were 32.5%±5.5%, 27.3%±1.8%, and 27.1%±2.6%, respectively. The 95% confidence interval of volume fraction were (31.0, 34.1), (26.8, 27.7), and (26.9, 28.5), respectively. The AVF group showed higher cement volume fraction in 3 groups (P<0.05), and there were no significant difference between non-AVF and normal group (P>0.05). There were 19 (36.5%) patients with cement leakage in AVF group, 12 (20.7%) in non-AVF group, and 68 (17.7%) in normal group. The AVF group showed higher cement leakage (P<0.05). Compared with AVF group and normal group, non-AVF group had lower bone mineral density in preoperation. All groups reported significantly improved visual analog scale scores and Cobb angle on the day of surgery. However, there were no significant difference between the 3 groups.
Conclusions: 
Unilateral PKP is an effective and safe procedure for patients with OVCF. However, cement volume should be determined in terms of the vertebral body fraction to obtain a favorable outcome. The risk of AVF and cement leakage will increase obviously with the cement volume fraction increased. We recommend that a bone cement volume fraction of about one fourth is suitable for unilateral PKP.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Destructive compression tests and finite element analyses were conducted to investigate the biomechanical strength at the graft-endplate interface in anterior cervical fusion.
Objectives: 
To investigate the effect of endplate thickness, endplate holes, and bone mineral density of the vertebral body on the biomechanical strength of the endplate-graft interface in an anterior interbody fusion of the cervical spine.
Summary of background: 
Subsidence of the graft into the vertebral body is a well-known complication in anterior cervical fusion. However, there is no information in the literature regarding the compressive strength of the graft-endplate interface in relation to the endplate thickness, holes in the endplate, and bone mineral density of the vertebral body.
Methods: 
Biomechanical destructive compression tests and finite element analyses were performed in this study. Cervical vertebral bodies (C3-C7) isolated from seven cadaveric cervical spines (age at death 69-86 years, mean 79 years) were used for compression tests. Bone mineral density of each vertebral body was measured using a dual energy radiograph absorptiometry unit. Endplate thickness was measured using three coronal computed tomography images of the middle portion of the vertebral body obtained using a computer-assisted imaging analysis. Then each vertebral body was cut into halves through the horizontal plane. A total of 54 specimens, consisting of one endplate and half of the vertebral body, were obtained after excluding eight vertebrae with gross pathology on plain radiograph. Specimens were assigned to one of three groups with different endplate conditions (Group I, intact; Group II, partial removal; and Group III, complete removal) so that group mean bone mineral density became similar. Each endplate was slowly compressed until failure using an 8-mm-diameter metal indenter, and the load to failure was determined as a maximum force on a recorded force-displacement curve. The effect on the strength of the graft-endplate interface of various hole patterns in the endplate was studied using a finite element technique. The simulatedhole patterns included the following: one large central hole, two lateral holes, two holes in the anterior and posterior portion of the endplate, and four holes evenly distributed from the center of the endplate. Stress distribution in the endplate was predicted in response to an axial compressive force of 110 N, and the elements with von Mises stress greater than 4.0 MPa were determined as failed.
Results: 
The endplate thickness and bone mineral density were similar at all cervical levels, and the superior and inferior endplates had similar thickness at all cervical levels. There was no significant association between bone mineral density and endplate thickness. Load to failure was found to have a significant association with bone mineral density but not with endplate thickness. However, load to failure tends to decrease with incremental removal of the endplate, and load to failure of the specimens with an intact endplate was significantly greater than that of the specimens with no endplate. Finite element model predictions showed significant influence of the hole pattern on the fraction of the upper endplate exposed to fracture stress. A large hole was predicted to be more effective than the other patterns at distributing a compressive load across the remaining area and thus minimizing the potential fracture area.
Conclusion: 
Results of this study suggest that it is important to preserve the endplate as much as possible to prevent graft subsidence into the vertebral body, particularly in patients with poor bone quality. It is preferable to make one central hole rather than multiple smaller holes in the endplate for vascularity of the bone graft because it reduces the surface area exposed to fracture stresses.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) play an important role in postoperative pain management. However, their use in the setting of spine fusion surgery setting has long been a topic of controversy. In this review we examined relevant research, including in vivo, animal, and clinical human studies, with the aim of understanding the effect of NSAIDs on spinal fusion.
Study design::Setting: 
Systematic review of study designs of all types from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to single-institution retrospective reviews.
Methods: 
A search of PubMed and Embase was conducted using the keywords: "spine," "spinal fracture," NSAIDs, anti-inflammatory non-steroidal agents, bone, bone healing, fracture, fracture healing, yielding a total of 110 studies. Other 28 studies were identified by cross-referencing, resulting in total 138 studies.
Results: 
There is no level I evidence from human studies regarding the use of NSAIDs on spinal fusion rates. The overall tone of the spine literature in the early 2000s was that NSAIDs increased the rate of non-union; however, nearly all human studies published after 2005 suggest that short-term (<2 weeks) postoperative use have no such effect. The dose dependency that is seen with a 2-week postoperative course is not present when NSAIDs are only used for 48 h after surgery.
Conclusions: 
NSAID appear to have dose-dependent and duration-dependent effects on fusion rates. The short-term use of low-dose NSAIDs around the time of spinal fusion surgery is reasonable. Spine surgeons can consider the incorporation of NSAIDs into pain control regimens for spinal fusion patients with the goal of improving pain control and reducing the costs and complications associated with opioids.},

  abstract={From 1980 until 1989, 69 patients with lumbar fractures resulting in incomplete paraparesis were admitted to the authors' medical center for treatment. Thirty had anterior vertebrectomy, including 18 who had posterior instrumentation and four who had anterior instrumentation. Twenty-two patients were treated with a posterolateral decompression and fusion, including four who also required an anterior decompression. Nineteen of the remaining 21 patients required posterior spine instrumentation and fusion only. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor index score was determined for each patient pre- and postoperatively and used to compare these three treatment groups. Average follow-up period for the patients was 19 months. The improvement in ASIA motor score for all patients treated with decompression averaged 10 and similar improvement was obtained in those who were treated with posterior decompression (10.2 points). The average improvement in those who had vertebrectomy was 9.9 points. For those who had fusion without decompression, average improvement was 4.2 points. Comparing those patients who were surgically decompressed, either anteriorly or posteriorly, with those patients who only underwent fusion, the difference in neurologic improvement was statistically significant. Neurologic outcome after lumbar fractures is improved by surgical decompression. The neurologic outcome results were similar after anterior and posterior decompression.},

  abstract={Study design: 
An in vitro laboratory study.
Objective: 
(i) To evaluate the effect of osteoporotic degree in determining the strength of sacral screw fixation and (ii) to compare the strength of unaugmented bicortical pedicle screw and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmented unicortical pedicle screw in sacral fixation.
Summary of background data: 
Screw loosening is a clinical problem in lumbosacral fusions, especially in osteoporotic patients. To improve the screw anchoring strength of sacrum, bicortical and PMMA augmented sacral pedicle screw fixation techniques are widely used in clinical practice. However, the biomechanical strength of the bicortical and PMMA augmented sacral screw fixations remains undetermined in different degrees of osteoporosis.
Methods: 
Twenty-five fresh osteoporotic cadavers were used in this study. According to the value of lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by DEXA, specimens were divided into 3 groups: group A (N=9): BMD=0.7 to 0.8 g/cm, group B (N=8): BMD=0.6 to 0.7 g/cm, and group C (N=8): BMD<0.6 g/cm. In each specimen, S1 pedicle screw was inserted bicortically on the left side, and S1 pedicle screw with PMMA augmentation was inserted unicortically on the right side of the sacrum. Following a dynamic cyclic loading from 30 to 250 N on the screw head for 2000 cycles, the subsidence displacement and axial pull-out strength of each screw were measured.
Results: 
No anchoring failure (defined as the subsidence displacement exceeding 2 mm within 2000 loading cycles) occurred in group A and B. However, in group C, 6 cases (75%) in bicortical fixation and 5 cases (63%) in PMMA augmented fixation failed during cyclic loading. In group A, no significant difference between the bicortical and PMMA augmented fixations was detected in terms of the subsidence and maximal pull-out strength. In group B, significantly less subsidence and higher maximal pull-out strength were demonstrated in the PMMA augmented technique than that in the bicortical fixation. Both techniques exhibited lower subsidence of the screw in group A than in group B. The bicortical technique exhibited higher maximum pull-out strength in group A than that in group B. However, statistical difference in terms of PMMA augmentation was not detected between group A and B.
Conclusion: 
For BMD value more than 0.70 g/cm, bicortical sacral pedicle screw fixation could obtain sufficient anchoring strength comparable with the PMMA augmented technique. When BMD value is within 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm, the PMMA augmented technique would be more beneficial in improving the fixation strength than the bicortical fixation. For BMD values less than 0.6 g/cm, early screw loosening may occur in both bicortical and PMMA augmented fixations.},

  abstract={Uncertainty regarding the benefits of vertebroplasty (VP) for the treatment of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures has recently arisen. A prospective, controlled, randomized single-center trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00994032) was designed to compare the effects of VP versus conservative treatment on the quality of life and pain in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, new fractures and secondary adverse effects were also analyzed during a 12-month follow-up period. A total of 125 patients were randomly assigned to receive conservative treatment or VP. The primary end point was to compare the evolution of the quality of life (Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis [Qualeffo-41] and pain (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) during a 12 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included comparison of analgesic consumption, clinical complications, and radiological vertebral fractures at the same time points. Both arms showed significant improvement in VAS scores at all time points, with greater improvement (p = 0.035) in the VP group at the 2-month follow-up. Significant improvement in Qualeffo total score was seen in the VP group throughout the study, whereas this was not seen in the conservative treatment arm until the 6-month follow-up. VP treatment was associated with a significantly increased incidence of vertebral fractures (odds ratio [OR], 2 · 78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-7.62, p = 0.0462). VP and conservative treatment are both associated with significant improvement in pain and quality of life in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures over a 1-year follow-up period. VP achieved faster pain relief with significant improvement in the pain score at the 2-month follow-up but was associated with a higher incidence in vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To evaluate the effect of vertebroplasty with a bone filler device compared with balloon kyphoplasty.
Methods: 
A total of 222 patients underwent operations from January 2008 to October 2012. One-level fractures numbered 169 (86.7%) cases and two-level fractures numbered 26 (13.3%). A total of 221 vertebral levels were analyzed consequently. Vertebral height, compression ratio, and segmental Cobb's angle were measured in preoperative and postoperative lateral X-rays.
Results: 
The compression ratio was the most influential parameter among three variables. Adjusted postoperative compression ratio was not significantly different between two operation groups. Bone cement leakage rates did not differ (p < 0.05). Bone cement distribution was spongy type in the majority of the vertebroplasty with bone filler device (94.5%), but only in 42.0% of the kyphoplasty. High bone densitometry readings and long period from diagnosis to operation were significant risk factors for bone cement leakage.
Conclusions: 
Vertebroplasty with a bone filler device could achieve equivalent compression reduction and bone cement leakage rate, as well as greater sponge-type bone cement distribution, which were advantages over balloon kyphoplasty.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Vertebral fragility fractures are often treated by injecting bone cement into the collapsed vertebral bodies (vertebroplasty). The mechanisms by which vertebroplasty induces pain relief are not completely understood yet and recent debates cast doubt over the outcome of the procedure. The controversy is intensified by inconsistent results of randomized clinical trials and biomechanical studies that have investigated the effectiveness or the change in biomechanical response due to the reinforcement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty, by varying the relevant treatment parameters and (a) computationally predicting the improvement of the fracture risk depending on the chosen treatment strategy, and (b) identifying the determinants of a successful treatment.
Methods: 
A Finite Element model with a patient-specific failure criterion and direct simulation of PMMA infiltration in four lumbar vertebrae was used to assess the condition of the bone under compressive load before and after the virtual treatment, simulating in a total of 12000 virtual treatments.
Results: 
The results showed that vertebroplasty is capable of reducing the fracture risk by magnitudes, but can also have a detrimental effect. Effectiveness was strongly influenced by interactions between local bone quality, cement volume and injection location. However, only a moderate number of the investigated treatment strategies were able to achieve the necessary improvement for preventing a fracture.
Conclusions: 
We conclude that the effectiveness of vertebroplasty is sensitive to the patient's condition and the treatment strategy.},

  abstract={Background and objective: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been successfully used in the treatment of pain related to osteoporotic vertebral fractures refractory to medical therapy, especially in the treatment of acute factures. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach in the treatment of painful chronic vertebral fractures is less clear.
Patients and methods: 
In this report we evaluate the short and long-term effectiveness in pain relief of PVP in a group of 5 patients with pain related to chronic osteoporotic vertebral fractures without bone marrow edema (BME) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients were followed during one year, assessing analgesic use, pain evolution (on a 10-point visual analog scale [VAS]), new vertebral fractures and other clinical complications. Seven procedures were performed in the 5 patients.
Results: 
All patients reported substantial improvement in back pain 2 weeks after the procedure, with a mean decrease of 53% in the VAS. However, one year after PVP most patients (4 out 5) worsened, achieving similar VAS scores to those obtained at baseline. No additional vertebral fractures or other clinical complications were observed.
Conclusion: 
The present cases suggest that the long-term effectiveness of PVP in the treatment of painful chronic vertebral fractures without BME on MRI is scarce.},

To determine whether vertebroplasty is more effective than placebo for patients with pain of recent onset (≤ 6 weeks) or severe pain (score ≥ 8 on 0-10 numerical rating scale).
Design: 
Meta-analysis of combined individual patient level data.
Setting: 
Two multicentred randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty; one based in Australia, the other in the United States.
Participants: 
209 participants (Australian trial n = 78, US trial n = 131) with at least one radiographically confirmed vertebral compression fracture. 57 (27%) participants had pain of recent onset (vertebroplasty n = 25, placebo n = 32) and 99 (47%) had severe pain at baseline (vertebroplasty n = 50, placebo n = 49).
Intervention: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty versus a placebo procedure.
Main outcome measure: 
Scores for pain (0-10 scale) and function (modified, 23 item Roland-Morris disability questionnaire) at one month.
Results: 
For participants with pain of recent onset, between group differences in mean change scores at one month for pain and disability were 0.1 (95% confidence interval -1.4 to 1.6) and 0.2 (-3.0 to 3.4), respectively. For participants with severe pain at baseline, between group differences for pain and disability scores at one month were 0.3 (-0.8 to 1.5) and 1.4 (-1.2 to 3.9), respectively. At one month those in the vertebroplasty group were more likely to be using opioids.
Conclusions: 
Individual patient data meta-analysis from two blinded trials of vertebroplasty, powered for subgroup analyses, failed to show an advantage of vertebroplasty over placebo for participants with recent onset fracture or severe pain. These results do not support the hypothesis that selected subgroups would benefit from vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Painful fractures of the spine pose a serious clinical problem which gains in importance with the increasing ageing of our population. When conservative treatment of these fractures fails, with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty we have two percutaneous minimally invasive stabilising procedures at our disposal.
Patients and methods: 
We performed a prospective study of 90 patients with fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures who had been treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in our clinic between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. Clinical analysis included Oswestry score and VAS index; the vertebral body height restoration (mean vertebral body height, kyphosis angle, anterior/posterior edge) was evaluated radiologically; furthermore, all occurring complications were recorded. The follow-up time was 1 year, 80 patients could be examined at follow-up; 8 patients had died of a tumour disease, lost to follow-up were 2.2%.
Results: 
Both procedures succeeded in significantly (p<0.001) increasing quality of life (Oswestry score) and reducing pain (VAS). Following vertebroplasty there were two cases of cement leakage into the spinal canal with consecutive paraparesis which disappeared completely after the cement had been surgically removed. Altogether, 11 adjacent level fractures were observed, 4 in the vertebroplasty and 7 in the kyphoplasty group.
Conclusion: 
This study compares vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty with regard to their effectiveness, safety, and restoration of vertebral body height, and complications. There were no differences between the groups with regard to quality of life and pain improvement, but the rate of serious complications was higher after vertebroplasty. Mean vertebral body height restoration at 1 year follow-up was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the kyphoplasty group. It remains to be seen in future long-term studies whether or not restoration of vertebral body height has an effect on the clinical result.},

  abstract={Object: 
The aim in this study was to quantify the effects of vertebroplasty on endplate subsidence in treated and adjacent vertebrae and their relationship to endplate thickness and underlying trabecular bone in elderly female spines.
Methods: 
Vertebral compression fractures were created in female cadaveric (age range 51-88 years) thoracolumbar spine segments. Specimens were placed into either the control or vertebroplasty group (n = 9/group) such that bone mineral density, trabecular microarchitecture, and age were statistically similar between groups. For the vertebroplasty group, polymethylmethacrylate bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebral body under fluoroscopy. Cyclic compression (685-1370 N sinusoid) was performed on all spine segments for 115,000 cycles. Micro-CT scans were obtained before and after cyclic loading to quantify endplate subsidence. Maximum subsidence was compared between groups in the caudal endplate of the superior adjacent vertebra (SVcau); cranial (TVcra) and caudal (TVcau) endplates of the treated vertebra; and the cranial endplate of the inferior adjacent vertebra (IVcra). In addition, micro-CT images were used to quantify average endplate thickness and trabecular bone volume fraction. These parameters were then correlated with maximum endplate subsidence for each endplate.
Results: 
The maximum subsidence in SVcau endplate for the vertebroplasty group (0.34 ± 0.58 mm) was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than for the control group (-0.13 ± 0.27 mm). Maximum subsidence in the TVcra, TVcau, and IVcra endplates were greater in the vertebroplasty group, but these differences were not significant (p > 0.16). Increased subsidence in the vertebroplasty group manifested locally in the anterior region of the SVcau endplate and in the posterior region of the TVcra and TVcau endplates (p < 0.10). Increased subsidence was observed in thinner endplates with lower trabecular bone volume fraction for both vertebroplasty and control groups (R(2) correlation up to 62%). In the SVcau endplate specifically, these 2 covariates aided in understanding subsidence differences between vertebroplasty and control groups.
Conclusions: 
Bone cement injected during vertebroplasty alters local biomechanics in elderly female spines, resulting in increased endplate disruption in treated and superior adjacent vertebrae. More specifically, bone cement increases subsidence in the posterior regions of the treated endplates and the anterior region of the superior caudal endplate. This increased subsidence may be the initial mechanism leading to subsequent compression fractures after vertebroplasty, particularly in vertebrae superior to the treated level.},

This study is based on a systematic review of the literature (until October 2004) and meta-analysis of clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of BK in the treatment of VCFs. Estimates of effect were based on a random effects model. Meta-regression analyses were carried out where required. A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although studies displayed considerable methodological limitations, the results of the clinical series indicate significant improvements in pain intensity, vertebral height, sagittal alignment, functional capacity, and quality of life. Compared with conventional medical management, BK afforded significant improvement in pain intensity and mobility. Likewise, a significant reduction was observed in vertebral collapse, kyphotic deformity, the development of new vertebral fractures, and hospital stay. Compared with vertebroplasty, the technique reduced the loss of height and the degree of kyphotic deformity, and afforded a significantly lower leakage rate-with no differences in relation to other variables. Regarding adverse effects, leakage affected 7% of all levels treated, while complications were recorded in 2% of the patients, and new vertebral fractures in 16%. The available evidence suggests that BK can be effective and safe in application to VCFs. However, existing studies evince substantial methodological limitations and relatively short follow-up periods. Better clinical research is required to determine the capacity of BK to avoid the functional and physiological sequelae of VCFs and to define the true role of the technique among the existing therapeutic options.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the efficacy and safety of our target puncture technique with the traditional technique during percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with intravertebral clefts (IVCs).
Methods: 
104 patients treated with PKP for single OVCFs with IVCs were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were divided into three groups: cleft filling by the traditional technique (Group A, n=18); interdigitated filling (Group B, n=50); and overfilling by the target technique (Group C, n=36). Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores and radiological evidence of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fractures were studied before and after surgery (immediate, 1 and 2 years).
Results: 
The ODI and VAS scores decreased for all patients and no significant difference was found between the three groups after treatment. However, 1 and 2 years after surgery a greater increase in ODI and VAS scores was observed in Group A compared with the other two groups. The initial correction of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle was not significant among the three groups. However, loss of correction was greater in Group A. No significant difference was found in cement leakage. The incidence of adjacent vertebral fractures in Group C was higher than in the other two groups.
Conclusions: 
Different puncture techniques were initially effective for all patients with IVCs. However, cement cleft filling by the traditional technique was found to have less stability causing higher VAS/ODI scores and greater loss of correction. Hence, our target puncture technique was recommended in this study.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The purpose of this systematic literature review was to summarize information on the efficacy of percutaneous vertebral augmentation (PVA) and the incorporation of physical therapy intervention following PVA for vertebral compression fractures (VCF).
Methods: 
Literature searches were completed using the Cochrane Library: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): National Guideline Clearinghouse; Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro); Medline; and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) through August 2005.
Results: 
Seventeen relevant studies were identified. They reported favorable outcomes (eg, earlier mobility, decreased pain, and improved spinal posture) after PVA. No study addressed physical therapy intervention after PVA.
Conclusion: 
PVA appears to be an effective treatment option for individuals with VCF. However, research dealing with physical therapy after PVA is needed.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Limited data exists regarding the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty for multiple synchronous and metachronous vertebral compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the number of vertebral levels treated during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures or the number of separate vertebroplasty procedures performed on a given patient affect clinical outcomes.
Materials and methods: 
We defined 3 patient populations in our retrospective study. Group 1 included 328 patients who underwent 1 single-level vertebroplasty procedure. Group 2 included 226 patients who underwent a single procedure in which 2 or more vertebral levels were treated. Group 3 included 101 patients who underwent 2 or more separate vertebroplasty procedures. Follow-up was performed between 1 week and 2 years postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were assessed through analysis of quantitative measurements of pre- and postoperative levels of pain with and without activity (0-10) as well as mobility improvement. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to evaluate the differences among groups. Univariate and chi(2) analyses were performed to show the proportion of underlying diseases in each group.
Results: 
Mean pain improvement with/without activity at 2-year follow-up was 5.8/3, 4.9/3.7, and 5.4/3.1 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and mean mobility improvement in 2-year follow-up was 0.67, 0.63, and 0.65 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Conclusions: 
There was no significant difference in pain relief and mobility improvement in patients treated for multiple synchronous or metachronous vertebral compression fractures in comparison with those treated for solitary isolated fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
In vitro biomechanical investigation using human cadaveric vertebral bodies.
Objective: 
To evaluate differences in biomechanical stability of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) repaired using an expandable titanium mesh implant, with and without cement, as compared with standard balloon kyphoplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebral augmentation, either in the form of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, is the treatment of choice for some VCFs. Polymethylmethacrylate, a common bone cement used in this procedure, has been shown to possibly cause injury to neural and vascular structures due to extravasation, embolization, and may be too rigid for an osteoporotic spine. Therefore, suitable alternatives for the treatment of VCFs have been sought.
Methods: 
Individual vertebral bodies from 5 human cadaveric spines (from T4 to L5) were stripped of all soft tissues, and compressed at 25% of the intact height using methods previously described. Vertebral bodies were then randomly assigned to the following repair techniques: (1) conventional kyphoplasty, (2) titanium implant with cement, (3) titanium implant without cement. All vertebral bodies were then recompressed at 25% of the repaired height. Yield load, ultimate load, and stiffness were recorded and compared in these groups before and after treatment.
Results: 
There were no differences in biomechanical data between intact groups, and between repaired groups. In all 3 treatment groups, yield load and ultimate load of repaired vertebrae were similar to that of intact vertebrae. However, the stiffness following repair was found to be statistically less than the stiffness of the intact vertebral body (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
Conclusion: 
Based on the biomechanical data, the titanium mesh implant with or without cement was similar to polymethylmethacrylate fixation by kyphoplasty in the treatment of VCFs. Avoiding the adverse effects caused by using cement may be the main advantage of the titanium mesh implant and warrants further study.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the influence of spinal cord decompression on posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fracture, and to provide the practical basis for the indications of posterior spinal cord decompression.
Methods: 
The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from 170 cases of thoracolumbar fracture treated with posterior surgical treatment between January 2005 and January 2009. There were 119 males and 51 females with an average age of 42.7 years (range, 17-68 years). The fracture locations included TI1 in 22 cases, T12 in 30 cases, L1 in 57 cases, and L2 in 61 cases. According to Denis classification system, there were 65 cases of compression fractures, 44 cases of burst fractures, 25 cases of flexion-distraction injuries, and 36 cases of fracture-dislocations. The time from injury to operation was 3-8 days (mean, 4.4 days). All the cases were divided into 4 groups according to space-occupying rates of spinal cord: group A, < or = 20% (n = 32); group B, 21%-40% (n = 68); group C, 41%-60% (n = 37); and group D, > or = 61% (n = 33). Through statistical analysis, the correlation between space-occupying rates and spinal cord function (Frankel grade) was evaluated, and the necessities of spinal cord decompression was studied in the patients who had neurological symptoms with space-occupying rates under 40%.
Results: 
There was no positive correlation between the degree of spinal cord injury and the space-occupying rates of bone fragments broken into the spinal canal. All patients were followed up 13-41 months (mean, 23.5 months). During the follow-up period, no secondary neurological damage occurred in the patients who were not given posterior spinal cord decompression with space-occupying rates under 40% (28 cases). And also in the cohort of patients with neurological symptoms whose space-occupying rates were under 40%, the posterior spinal cord decompression (65 cases) could improve the spinal cord function significantly when compared with no decompression cohort (7 cases), (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The relative indications of posterior spinal cord decompression for thoracolumbar fracture are as follows: the cases having neurological symptoms with space-occupying rates under 40% and the ones having the neurological symptoms or not with space-occupying rates above 40%.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
This study aimed to compare the results of the two different treatment regimens (percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) and conservative treatment (CT)) regarding to efficacy, quality of life, functional and radiological results in patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVF).
Methods: 
The study comprised 83 patients who presented with complaints of OVF associated with osteoporosis and were treated with CT (37) or PV (46). All patients were evaluated according to preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and plain radiographs.
Results: 
All patients in VP group reported a significant decrease in pain at 1st day postoperative. While Pain relief and functional outcomes were significantly better in PV group than CT at 1st and 3rd months according to VAS and ODI scores, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups at 6th months follow-up. The mean preoperative local sagittal Cobb angle (LSCA) and the mean vertebra corpus mid-level height (MVCH) were 42.3° and 14.6 mm in the PV group, while they were measured as 39.8° and 15.7 mm in CT group, respectively. 15.6° decreasing the LSCA and 10.2 mm increasing MVCH were noted in the PV group at the 6th month follow-up. While LSCA increased 19.1° and MVCH decreased 7.6mm in CT group at same time period (p<0.001).
Conclusions: 
Compared to the CT group, PV provides a rapid decrease of pain and an early return to daily life activities. Although improvement was observed on the radiological findings following treatment in the PV group, PV may not enhance the quality of life in patients with acute OVF at 6th months follow up.},

To assess technical feasibility and mechanical properties of 3 locking plate designs (Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2) for use in the canine cervical spine.
Study design: 
Prospective ex vivo study.
Animals: 
Cadaver cervical spines from skeletally mature large breed dogs (n = 18).
Methods: 
Specimens were screened using radiography and allocated into balanced groups based on bone density. Stiffness of intact C4-C5 vertebral motion units was measured in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using nondestructive 4-point bend testing. Uniplate 2 was then implanted at C4-C5 and mechanical testing was repeated. Mechanical test data were compared against those from 6 spines implanted with monocortical screws, an allograft ring spacer, and PMMA.
Results: 
The Zero-P and Zero-P VA systems could not be surgically implanted due to anatomical constraints in the vertebral column sizes of the canine cervical spines used in this study. Fixation with Uniplate 2 or with screws/PMMA significantly increased stiffness of the C4-C5 vertebral motion units compared to unaltered specimens (P < .001) in extension. Stiffness of the titanium screw/PMMA fixation was significantly greater than the Uniplate 2 construct in extension. Flexion and lateral bending could not be evaluated in 3 of 6 specimens in the Uniplate 2 group due to failure at the bone/implant interface during extension testing.
Conclusion: 
Fixation with Uniplate 2 was biomechanically inferior to screws/PMMA. Particularly concerning was the incidence of vertebral fracture after several testing cycles. Based on our results, Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2 cannot be recommended for use in dogs requiring cervical fusion.},

  abstract={Object: 
The management of odontoid fractures remains controversial. Evidence-based methodology was used to review the published data on odontoid fracture management to determine the state of the current practices reported in the literature.
Methods: 
The Medline literature (1966-1999) was searched using the keywords "odontoid," "odontoid fracture," and "cervical fracture" and graded using a four-tiered system. Those articles meeting selection criteria were divided in an attempt to formulate practice guidelines and standards or options for each fracture type. Evidentiary tables were constructed by treatment type. Ninety-five articles were reviewed. Five articles for Type I, 16 for Type II, and 14 for Type III odontoid fractures met selection criteria. All studies reviewed contained Class III data (American Medical Association data classification).
Conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence to establish a standard or guideline for odontoid fracture management. Given the extent of Class III evidence and outcomes reported on Type I and Type III fractures, a well-designed casecontrolled study would appear to provide sufficient evidence to establish a practice guideline, suggesting that cervical immobilization for 6 to 8 weeks is appropriate management. In cases of Type II fracture, analysis of the Class III evidence suggests that both operative and nonoperative management remain treatment options. A randomized trial or serial case-controlled studies will be required to establish either a guideline or treatment standard for this fracture type.},

Prospective controlled cohort study of 27 adult osteoporotic patients who underwent kyphoplasty for fresh osteoporotic spinal fractures.
Objectives: 
To define the evolution of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) at kyphoplasty and adjacent levels along with sagittal spinal alignment to contribute to the etiology of adjacent vertebral fractures after augmentation.
Summary of background data: 
Osteoporotic compression fractures can be effectively treated with methylmethacrylate vertebral augmentation. However, to the authors' knowledge the effect of vertebral augmentation on the vertebral endplate BMD of the augmented and adjacent nonaugmented levels has not as yet been described.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven consecutive selected patients (9 men, 18 women), with an average age of 72+/-9 years underwent 1, 2, or 3-level percutaneous kyphoplasty for painful fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures at the thoracolumbar spine. All patients were radiologically examined with plain roentgenograms, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Lateral dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in the augmented and on the adjacent vertebrae (1 level above and below kyphoplasty) was used to measure BMD preoperatively to the last postoperative observation in the subchondral bone of the vertebral endplates. Anthropometric data, sagittal global balance (plumbline), and segmental spine reconstruction (vertebral body height, Gardner kyphotic angle) were recorded and analyzed. The patients were followed for at least 2 years.
Results: 
Kyphoplasty was performed between T12 and L5. A total of 48 vertebral bodies were augmented. Thirteen patients received 1 level and the remaining 14 received 2 or 3-level kyphoplasty. No significant changes in the sagittal spinal balance were shown postoperatively. Gardner kyphotic angle and posterior vertebral body height improved postoperatively, however, insignificantly. Significant [analysis of variance (ANOVA), P=0.008] increase of anterior vertebral body height in the fractured vertebra was achieved postoperatively without subsequent loss of correction. BMD increased significantly in the lower endplate of the augmented vertebra (ANOVA, P=0.05). In 1-level augmentation, no BMD changes were shown at the adjacent vertebrae above and below kyphoplasty. On the contrary, in the multilevel augmentation, a statistically significant (ANOVA, P=0.05) decrease of the BMD was shown in the upper endplate of the adjacent level above kyphoplasty. During the 2-year follow-up, there were 5 (18%) new fractures at the T11-T12 area above the augmented vertebra. All of the fractures occurred in patients who received 2 and 3-level kyphoplasty.
Conclusions: 
The observed 2-year evolution of vertebral endplate BMD, after kyphoplasty under stable global sagittal spinal balance, might contribute to the pathogenesis of new fractures in adjacent vertebra. However, other studies with control series and longer follow-up are necessary to show if these BMD changes are the result of vertebral augmentation or are merely natural history.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Previous ex vivo biomechanical studies have shown that kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate cement increases vertebral body (VB) strength and restores VB stiffness and height after compression fracture. The purpose of the current study was to determine if a hydroxyapatite cement used as a void filler during kyphoplasty provides mechanical stabilization similar to that of a polymethylmethacrylate cement.
Methods: 
Simulated compression fractures were experimentally created in 33 osteoporotic VBs harvested from female cadaver spines. VBs were assigned to one of three groups: 1) kyphoplasty with a custom mixture of Simplex P; 2) kyphoplasty with BoneSource; and 3) no treatment. The kyphoplasty treatment consisted of inserting a balloon-like device into the VB via both pedicles, inflating the tamp, and filling the created void with Simplex P bone cement or BoneSource. VBs in the no-treatment group received no interventions. Pre- and posttreatment heights were measured, and the repaired VBs were recompressed to determine posttreatment strength and stiffness values.
Results: 
Kyphoplasty with altered Simplex P restored strength, whereas kyphoplasty with BoneSource and the no-treatment protocol both resulted in significantly weaker VBs relative to initial strength. All treatments resulted in significantly less stiff VBs relative to their initial condition. All VBs lost significant height after initial compression, but a significant amount of lost height was restored by kyphoplasty with either cement.
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty with either cement significantly restored VB height. Kyphoplasty with altered Simplex P resulted in stronger repairs than did no treatment or kyphoplasty with BoneSource.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Ex vivo biomechanical study using osteoporotic cadaveric vertebral bodies.
Objective: 
To determine if fracture reduction could be achieved by the inflatable bone tamp (tamp) in vertebral bodies under simulated physiologic loads.
Summary of background data: 
Previous ex vivo biomechanical studies showed that kyphoplasty restored vertebral body height with vertebral body endplates under stress-free conditions.
Methods: 
Simulated compression fractures were experimentally created in 18 osteoporotic vertebral bodies alternatingly assigned to one of two treatment (tamp inflation) groups: low axial load (111 N) or high axial load (222 N). Each vertebral body was then placed between two platens in a special radiolucent loading fixture and subjected to the preassigned load to simulate in vivo physiologic loading. The tamps were inflated and postreduction heights were measured fluoroscopically. The effect of applied load and condition on vertebral body height was checked for significance (P < 0.05).
Results: 
Comparing the experimental conditions (initial, postcompression, postinflation), there were no significant vertebral body height differences between the load groups (low load vs. high load). However, vertebral body height differences between conditions within each load group were all significant. For the low-load and high-load groups, mean postinflation heights (24.4 and 24.4 mm) were significantly greater than mean postcompression heights (21.6 and 22.5 mm) but significantly less than initial vertebral body heights (26.6 and 26.3 mm), respectively. Initial heights were fully restored in 22% (two of nine) of vertebral bodies in both groups.
Conclusion: 
The inflatable bone tamp restored some of the height lost to compression fractures in vertebral bodies under simulated physiologic loads.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
The purpose of this study is to assess radiologic features of intravertebral cleft (IVC) in nonacute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) patients, and analyze the existence of IVC impact on outcomes of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
Summary of background data: 
The IVC sign is regarded as vertebral instability and the cause of persisting pain. It is more likely to happen at nonacute OVCFs patients. Patients with IVC sign have different outcomes from these without IVC treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. There were rare reports about the outcomes of patients with IVC sign treated by PKP.
Materials and methods: 
We divided 92 nonacute OVCFs patients (total of 113 vertebrae) into 2 groups according to the existence of IVC. Preoperative and postoperative Visual Analogue Scales, Oswestry Disability Index, kyphotic angulation (KA), and anterior vertebral height were recorded; the incidence and radiologic features of IVC were analyzed.
Results: 
The diagnostic sensitivity of IVC on plain radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were 35.4%, 89.3%, and 83.3%, respectively. The IVC group had an average correction KA of 9.14 degrees and reduction of ratio of compression of 20.09%, and the non-IVC group was 8.76 degrees and 20.23%, respectively. Cleft pattern of cement accounted for 64.6% in IVC group and 27.7% in non-IVC group. Five/7 of cement leakage in IVC group was intradiscal leakage, whereas 7/9 of cement leakage in non-IVC group was perivertebral leakage.
Conclusions: 
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitivity to diagnose IVC sign than X-ray. PKP could improve pain, functional activity, KA, and anterior height of both IVC and non-IVC groups, however, there was more cleft pattern of cement and higher intradiscal cement leakage in the IVC group.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate vertebral augmentation with a novel reticulate bone filling container system by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection in cadaveric simulated vertebral compressive fracture and explore the effect of reticulate bone filling container on cement distribution controlling within vertebral body and the restoration of biomechanical properties after augmentation.
Methods: 
A total of 28 freshly frozen human vertebrae specimens were randomly divided into 4 groups. After the measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral height, each vertebra received an axle load by a MTS (material testing system) machine to test the initial strength and stiffness. Subsequently a simultaneous compressive fracture model was created to measure the stiffness and height of fractured vertebrae. Then the augmentation procedure was performed. Afterward the biomechanical properties and the vertebral height were similarly measured as pre-operatively. The expansion of bone filling container and the distribution of cement within vertebral body were morphologically observed by crossing the specimens in sagittal midline and also integrated with the radiographic results.
Results: 
Stiffness was significantly restored comparing with that of fractured level (P < 0.05). And the bipedicular groups had better restoration results than the unipedicular groups. The strength and height of specimens significantly increased after the augmentation procedure but without difference among groups. In axial radiographic view, the distribution of cement in vertebral body was oval or long oval-shaped in double-layer bone filling container groups while it was irregular in single-layer groups. After crossing, the double-layer version expanded well in vertebral body and could enwrap most of injected cement. There was only a little leakage near the vessel layer. But the single-layer version had a poor expansion and a large amount of cement leakage.
Conclusion: 
This novel reticulate bone void filling container system with different layers may restore both the biomechanical properties and the height of fractured vertebrae. But, with the benefit of reducing cement leakage, a double-layer design can enwrap most of injected PMMA and has a brighter prospect of clinical application.},

A Case report and review of the literature is presented here. Concomitant oesophageal perforations carry a high risk of being missed initially. CT alone can visualize the subtle indirect signs like peri-oesophageal air. The literature revealed that only peri-oesophageal air might be a valid indicator of oesophageal injury. There are no systematic data on thoracic spine fractures with concomitant oesophageal perforations. Mediastinitis secondary to oesophageal perforation might be treated conservatively with endoscopic stent placement rather than surgically. As the radiological signs of concomitant soft tissue injury, like oesophageal perforations, in fractures of the upper thoracic spine are subtle and easily missed initially only anticipation of concomitant injuries by the treating physician based on the trauma mechanism ensures a timely diagnosis.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
Recent publications compared treatment of vertebral fractures reporting improvement in the majority but with no significant difference between the local anaesthetic and vertebroplasty groups. Potential explanations include placebo response or therapeutic response to the "control procedure". We investigated whether preliminary facet joint injection can identify those patients whose pain arises from paravertebral structures rather than the vertebral insufficiency fracture itself.
Methods: 
Patients referred for treatment by vertebroplasty were first offered local anaesthetic and steroid facet joint injection (FJI) at the most painful level. Those who failed to respond were offered a vertebroplasty.
Results: 
Ninety one patients referred, 16 went straight to vertebroplasty. Sixty one of 75 were initially offered FJI. Twenty one were successful; two relapsed, had further FJIs with good results; three declined treatment; 5 had temporary benefit; 1 died from unrelated causes. Of 29 who failed to respond to FJIs, 24 underwent vertebroplasty and 23 had a successful outcome.
Conclusions: 
A third of patients technically suitable for vertebroplasty responded beneficially to FJI. In this group the pain mediator maybe one of instability and overload on the facet joints produced by adjacent wedge fracture. This protocol allows more selective and more successful vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Background: 
The biomechanical mechanism of spinal three-column after interspinous process fusion remains unclear. The goal of this study is to assess the biomechanics and clinical effects of facet joint plus interspinous process graft fusion on preventing postoperative correction loss in thoracolumbar fractures with disc damage treated with posterior approach.
Methods: 
By simulating internal fixation device removal postoperatively, two surgical finite element models of the L1-L2 segments for facet joint plus interspinous process fusion (treatment group model) and single-level facet joint fusion (control group model) were established and compression, flexion and extension were modeled on the basis of spinal three-column theory. The radiologic follow-up of a small prospective randomized controlled trial for the treatment group and control group was done to detect the clinical effects of these two surgical models.
Results: 
The disc compressive displacement and strain of the treatment group model were significantly reduced as compared to those of the control group model, the stress level on facet joint bone graft was also decreased. The posterior tension band of the treatment model was stronger and more stable than that of the control model. Accordingly, clinical trial results at postoperative late stage of the treatment group were significantly better than those of the control group, which had statistically significant difference (P<0.05).
Interpretation: 
Facet joint plus interspinous process fusion is able to model the three-dimensional spinal stability more effectively than single-level facet joint fusion and is superior in bony fusion to prevent postoperative late correction loss in thoracolumbar fracture surgery.},

  abstract={Background: 
The instantaneously recovered stability and strength following vertebral augmentation prevent continuous micro-motion and further collapse of fractured vertebrae. Despite this, during follow-up of our patients, we observed recompression of augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggravation of local kyphotic deformity.
Purpose: 
To identify the risk factors related to recompression and to evaluate the clinical significance of recompression.
Material and methods: 
One hundred and twenty-one patients who underwent single-level kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures were retrospectively analyzed and classified into the following two groups: group 1 with recompression and group 2 without recompression. Characteristics of patients and fractured vertebrae were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recompression. We evaluated the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores in both groups to elucidate the clinical impact.
Results: 
During an average of 20.75 ± 4.43 months of follow-up, 17 augmented vertebrae developed recompression. In the recompression group, vertebral height loss was accompanied by significantly aggravated local kyphotic deformity. The local kyphotic angle differed significantly between the two groups at final follow-up (P = 0.011). However, the VAS and ODI scores were maintained at final follow-up in both groups although the values were slightly higher in group 1. Solid lump distribution pattern (OR = 8.718; P = 0.003) and the degree of vertebral height restoration (OR = 1.260; P < 0.001) were identified as the most important risk factors for recompression.
Conclusion: 
Fractured vertebrae containing solid lump cement and those with more vertebral height restoration are at higher risk of recompression. More attention should be given to these patients considering the aggravated local kyphotic deformity.},

  abstract={Background: 
Closing-opening correction (COC) osteotomy is a useful procedure for severe angular kyphosis. However, there is no previous research on the reconstructed vertebrae with kyphotic malalignment in the presence of osteoporosis. Finite-element (FE) analysis was performed to estimate the biomechanical stress with both osteoporotic grades and corrective kyphotic angles during COC osteotomy for osteoporotic angular kyphosis.
Methods: 
FE models of COC osteotomy were created by changing three major parameters: (1) grade of osteoporosis; (2) kyphotic angle; and (3) compensated posture when standing still. Osteoporosis was graded at four levels: A, normal (nonosteoporotic); B, low-grade osteoporosis; C, middle-grade osteoporosis; D, high-grade osteoporosis. The kyphotic angle ranged from 0 degrees as normal to 15 degrees and 30 degrees as moderate and severe kyphosis, respectively. FE analyses were performed with and without assumed compensated posture in kyphotic models of 15 degrees and 30 degrees . Along each calculated axis of gravity, a 427.4-N load was applied to evaluate the maximum compressive principal stress (CPS) for each model.
Results: 
The CPS values for the vertebral element were the highest at the anterior element of T10 in all FE models. The maximum CPS at T10 increased based on the increases in both the grade of osteoporosis and the kyphotic angle. Compensated posture made the maximum CPS value decrease in the 15 degrees and 30 degrees kyphotic models. The highest CPS value was 40.6 MPa in the high-grade osteoporosis (group D) model with a kyphotic angle of 30 degrees . With the normal (nonosteoporotic) group A, the maximum CPS at T10 was relatively low. With middle- and high-grade osteoporosis (groups C and D, respectively), the maximum CPS at T10 was relatively high with or without compensated posture, except for the 0 degrees model.
Conclusions: 
Lack of correction in osteoporotic kyphosis leads to an increase in CPS. This biomechanical study proved the advantage of correcting the kyphotic angle to as close as possible to physiological alignment in the thoracolumbar spine, especially in patients with high-grade osteoporosis.},

  abstract={Background and importance: 
A porous bioresorbable polymer scaffold has previously been tested in preclinical animal models of spinal cord contusion injury to promote appositional healing, spare white matter, decrease posttraumatic cysts, and normalize intraparenchymal tissue pressure. This is the first report of its human implantation in a spinal cord injury patient during a pilot study testing the safety and feasibility of this technique (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02138110).
Clinical presentation: 
A 25-year-old man had a T11-12 fracture dislocation sustained in a motocross accident that resulted in a T11 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A traumatic spinal cord injury. He was treated with acute surgical decompression and spinal fixation with fusion, and enrolled in the spinal scaffold study. A 2 × 10 mm bioresorbable scaffold was placed in the spinal cord parenchyma at T12. The scaffold was implanted directly into the traumatic cavity within the spinal cord through a dorsal root entry zone myelotomy at the caudal extent of the contused area. By 3 months, his neurological examination improved to an L1 AIS grade C incomplete injury. At 6-month postoperative follow-up, there were no procedural complications or apparent safety issues related to the scaffold implantation.
Conclusion: 
Although longer-term follow-up and investigation are required, this case demonstrates that a polymer scaffold can be safely implanted into an acutely contused spinal cord. This is the first human surgical implantation, and future outcomes of other patients in this clinical trial will better elucidate the safety and possible efficacy profile of the scaffold.

Mean pullout strength was significantly higher in the groups with cement as compared to those without cement. However, in the cement groups, the screw-in group had the lowest mean pullout strength among 3 groups, and the mean pullout strength in the screw-out group was also significantly lower than that in the in situ group (P<.05).Adjustment of pedicle screw height after cement augmentation in a severely osteoporotic spine can significantly reduce the pullout strength of the screw.},

Systematic review.
Objective: 
To identify and describe reconstruction methods for the treatment of transverse sacral fracture (TSF) and to evaluate outcomes based on treatment interventions.
Summary of background data: 
A variety of surgical interventions for stabilization of TSFs exist, yet the optimal management remains unclear. Although there are many individual case reports and series describing techniques to stabilize TSF, prior reviews fail to provide a comprehensive summary of current and past surgical techniques and their individual outcomes.
Methods: 
Our systematic review searched the PubMed database using keywords identifying sacral fractures with a transverse component, requiring internal fixation for stabilization as well as a review of bibliographies and archives from meeting proceedings.
Results: 
Our search located 417 publications for abstract review, of which 27 (109 patients) with TSF were included. Average follow-up was 22 months (range, 0-82 mo). Thirty-eight patients (34%) underwent spinopelvic fixation (SPF), 53 (49%) underwent posterior pelvic ring fixation (PPRF), and 18 (17%) underwent both. PPRF included iliosacral screws (37 patients), transiliac screws (11 patients), transiliac screws with plating (3 patients), posterior plating (1 patient), and transiliac bar (1 patient). Additional injuries causing lumbosacral instability were seen in 8 patients (42%) who underwent SPF, 2 patients (18%) treated with PPRF, and 5 patients (45%) who were treated with both SPF and PPRF. Of those who presented with a neurological deficit, 5 patients (45%) with SPF, 9 (39%) with PPRF, and 3 (30%) with SPF and PPRF experienced full neurological recovery. Five patients (45%) with SPF, 7 (30%) with PPRF, and 5 (50%) with both regained partial neurological function. One patient (9%) with SPF, 7 (30%) with PPRF, and 2 (20%) with both experienced no neurological recovery.
Conclusion: 
PPRF seems to be effective for stabilization of TSF. However, in the setting of further injuries causing additional lumbosacral instability, SPF should be used to ensure effective stabilization.},

  abstract={Study design: 
In vitro biomechanical study.
Objective: 
To measure the effect that off-axis vertebral loading has on the stiffness and failure load of vertebrae.
Summary of background data: 
Adjacent level vertebral fractures not only are common in patients who received a vertebroplasty treatment but also occur in patients with conservatively treated wedge fractures. The wedge-like deformity, which is present in both groups, changes the spinal alignment. The load of vertebrae adjacent to the fractured vertebra will change from perpendicular to the endplate to a more shearing, off-axis, load. This change may induce a higher fracture risk for vertebrae adjacent to wedge-like deformed vertebrae.
Methods: 
Twenty vertebrae, harvested from one osteopenic cadaver spine and three osteoporotic cadaver spines, were loaded until failure. The vertebrae were loaded either perpendicular to the upper endplate, representing vertebrae in a spine without wedge fractures (0° group, n = 10), or at an angle of 20°, representing vertebrae adjacent to a wedge fracture (20° groups, n = 10). Vertebral failure load and stiffness were the most important outcome measures.
Results: 
The failure load was significantly higher (P 5 0.028) when tested at 0° (2854 N, SD 5 622 N), compared with vertebrae tested at 20° (2162 N, SD 5 670 N). Vertebrae were also significantly stiffer (P, 0.001) when tested at 0° (4017 N/mm, SD 5 970 N/mm) than those tested at 20° (2478 N/mm, SD 5 453 N/mm).
Conclusion: 
The failure load of osteopenic/osteoporotic vertebrae was 24% lower under off-axis loads (20°) than under axial loads (0°). This study may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of adjacent vertebral fractures after wedge-like deformities and demonstrates the importance of height reconstruction of wedge fractures in order to normalize the loading conditions on adjacent vertebrae.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
Surgical treatment is preferred in our department in all patients with type II and type III dens fractures, regardless of their age, with the exception of non-displaced or completely reduced fractures in young patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients over 65 years of age treated by direct osteosynthesis of the dens or posterior atlanto-axial fixation and spondylodesis.
Material: 
In the years 2001 to 2005, 28 patients aged 65 years and older were surgically treated for dens fracture. This included 13 men and 15 women between 65 and 90 years of age, with an average of 77.4 years. According to the treatment, i.e., direct dens osteosynthesis (1) or C1-C2 posterior fixation (2), two groups were evaluated, and two categories were considered by age, i.e., 65 to 74 years (8 patients) and 75 years and older (20 patients). In 23 patients, an isolated fracture of the dens was present and, in five patients, injury was part of a complex C1-C2 fracture. A Frankel grade D neurological deficit was found in three patients.
Methods: 
In all patients, surgical treatment by direct osteosynthesis of the dens from the anterior approach, using two cannulated screws, was preferred as the method of choice. However, in the case of distinct osteoporosis, fragmented fracture of the dens base or tear of the ligamentum transversum atlantis, we used the Harms method of posterior fusion with polyaxial screw fixation as the primary treatment, or the Magerl transarticular fixation completed with the Gallie technique from the dorsal approach. The patients were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 weeks, at 6 and 12 months, and then at one-year intervals. X-ray and clinical examinations were made at the regular follow-ups and functional radiographs were taken at 12 months following the surgery. The whole group was evaluated in the range of 18 to 84 months (average, 37.3 months). Neurological deficit was assessed on the basis of the Frankel classification. The results were analysed using the Chi-square test.
Results: 
Of 20 patients still living at the time of this evaluation, 11 underwent direct osteosynthesis and nine were treated by posterior instrumented spondylodesis. In group 1, pseudoarthrosis of the dens or fibrous callus developed in one patient (9.1 %) and a line of fracture was evident in one patient of group 2 (11.1 %), which was not significant (p<0.05). However, a statistically significant difference in mortality was found when the two age categories were compared (p>0.05), with 0 % in the younger and 40 % in the older category. The overall mortality within 6 weeks of injury was 28.6 %. Mortality in group 1 and group 2 was 21.4 % and 35.7 %, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant (p<0.05).
Discussion: 
We use conservative treatment only in the patients who are able to stand up and move soon after injury. If this is not feasible, we prefer surgical treatment with the same aim achieved as soon as possible without rigid external fixation. In this study, surgery was associated with an acceptable number of minor complications due to poor bone quality or health state of the patient. The higher mortality in the higher age category was obviously related to generally poorer health of these patients.
Conclusion: 
Surgical treatment can significantly improve the quality of life in elderly patients who have suffered a fracture of the dens. The surgical technique should be chosen to take bone quality, degenerative changes of the spine and overall health of the patient into consideration. Mortality after surgery is not related to the technique selected but to patient's age. Elderly patients with neurological deficit usually die due to co-morbidity, regardless of the therapy used.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A randomized clinical trial.
Objective: 
To compare the functional recovery between early kyphoplasty and conservative care in paratroopers with stable thoracolumbar fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Treatment of traumatic stable thoracolumbar fractures in young individuals is still a debate. Conservative management and kyphoplasty are options of therapy. But enough data are not available for supporting each.
Methods: 
We included 70 paratroopers with stable thoracolumbar fractures (A1 and A2 classification according to AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system) presenting <60 days after trauma and hyperintensity in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Old fractures and those requiring fixation were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 study groups to undergo percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (n=34) or conservative care (n=36) by applying orthosis for 2 months. Patients were followed for 12 months and were evaluated clinically using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI).
Results: 
The baseline characteristics were comparable between 2 study groups. The VAS score and ODI decreased significantly in both study groups after 12 months of treatment. The VAS score was significantly lower in kyphoplasty group after the intervention (P<0.001), 1 month (P<0.001), 3 months (P<0.001), 6 months (P<0.001), and 12 months (P<0.001) after the intervention. In addition, the ODI was significantly lower after the intervention (P<0.001), 1 month (P<0.001), 3 months (P<0.001), 6 months (P<0.001), and 12 months (P<0.001) after the intervention. Kyphoplasty was associated with shorter duration of returning to parachuting (P<0.001) and shorter duration of absence from work (P<0.001).
Conclusions: 
Early kyphoplasty in stable thoracolumbar fractures after parachute jumping is associated with less pain, better functional recovery, less days of absence from work, and shorter duration of returning to parachuting.},

To assess which of two alternative surgical approaches gives better long-term outcomes, 58 patients were studied, 29 in each group. The results of posterior wire stabilization without fusion according to Brandt were contrasted with those of the Cloward technique. We found significantly more late pain problems and restricted neck mobility in the group treated with wiring without fusion than in those managed with anterior fusion. We conclude that this continuing pain may be due to residual mobility in the damaged degenerated non-fused motion segment, and that the difference between the two groups may reflect the difference in the quality and rate of fusion achieved by the two surgical approaches.},

  abstract={The first percutaneous vertebroplasty, used to treat a painful cervical haemangioma, was performed by a French team in 1984 and reported in the literature in 1987. This technique has rapidly become the standard of care for treatment of medically refractory painful vertebral compression fractures. Vertebral fractures usually become evident because of pain of varying intensity that reduces the patient's quality of life, producing functional limitations, depression, disability, height loss, spinal instability and kyphotic deformity associated with impaired lung capacity. Many diseases may underlie vertebral compression fractures, such as osteoporosis, trauma, neoplasms and haemangioma. Vertebroplasty, as derived from our experience and a review of the literature data, has more than 70%-90% effectiveness for short-term pain reduction and return to activity. The aim of this paper was to describe the state of the art of this spinal interventional radiology procedure and to examine the future directions of percutaneous vertebroplasty.},

Neurologic recovery after surgery is better and the percentage of recurrence is lower in cases of isolated atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) compared with cases of AAS associated with basilar invagination or with subaxial subluxation. This suggests that the sooner surgery is undertaken in limited AAS, the better the outcome. The atlantoaxial posterior interval seems to be the best predictor of neurologic recovery following posterior fusion for AAS. Osteoporosis is a major problem in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies show that corticosteroids, even in a low dosage, contribute to spinal bone loss. This bone loss may be partially reversible after ceasing corticoid therapy. A new corticosteroid, deflazacort, which does not inhibit intestinal absorption of calcium, seems to limit bone loss.},

In their results, both investigators concluded that there was no significant difference in pain relief between the vertebroplasty group and control group 1 month after treatment. The trials described a different patient cohort from the one we treat with vertebroplasty. Both enrolled patients had back pain for <or=12 months. This duration of pain was far too long for a vertebroplasty trial, resulting in parallel trials of vertebroplasty on healed fractures. Where a study is needed, it should be comprised of patients with acute osteoporotic compression fractures, particularly those who are hospitalized or bedridden because of the pain of such fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging was not systematically performed before vertebroplasty, and inpatients were excluded. Inpatients with acute fracture pain are the group most likely to respond well to vertebroplasty. Enrolment was a problem in both trials. Randomization in both RCTs took >4 years for completion. We advise that vertebroplasty be offered to patients with recent fractures <8 weeks old who have uncontrolled pain as well as patients progressing to osteonecrosis and the intravertebral vacuum phenomenon (Kummels disease). The availability of recent MRI scanning is also critical to proper patient selection.},

  abstract={We reviewed all peer-reviewed papers analysing the cost-effectiveness of vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. In general, the procedures appear to be cost effective but are very dependent upon model input details. Better data, rather than new models, are needed to answer outstanding questions. Vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs), including vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), seek to stabilise fractured vertebral bodies and reduce pain. The aim of this paper is to review current literature on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs as well as to discuss the challenges for economic evaluation in this research area. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify existing published studies on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs in patients with osteoporosis. Only peer-reviewed published articles that fulfilled the criteria of being regarded as full economic evaluations including both morbidity and mortality in the outcome measure in the form of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were included. The search identified 949 studies, of which four (0.4 %) were identified as relevant with one study added later. The reviewed studies differed widely in terms of study design, modelling framework and data used, yielding different results and conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of VAPs. Three out of five studies indicated in the base case results that VAPs were cost effective compared to non-surgical management (NSM). The five main factors that drove the variations in the cost-effectiveness between the studies were time horizon, quality of life effect of treatment, offset time of the treatment effect, reduced number of bed days associated with VAPs and mortality benefit with treatment. The cost-effectiveness of VAPs is uncertain. In answering the remaining questions, new cost-effectiveness analysis will yield limited benefit. Rather, studies that can reduce the uncertainty in the underlying data, especially regarding the long-term clinical outcomes of VAPs, should be conducted.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate effects of vertebroplasty on restoration of vertebral body height and wedge angle and relief from pain in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective study of 156 patients (232 levels) who had undergone vertebroplasty was conducted. Treated vertebrae with cleft included 49 patients (49 levels) and that without cleft 107 patients (183 levels). Effects on restoration of vertebral body height and wedge angle, and pain scores between pre- and post-procedure were statistically analyzed by using a paired-sample t test, and Kruskal Wallis test.
Results: 
The height and wedge angle of the fractured vertebral body, and pain score, improved significantly after vertebroplasty. On a vertebra-by-vertebra analysis, the vertebral body height and wedge angle in the cleft group, were statistically significantly better post-procedure (P < 0.01); in the non-cleft group, there was nosignificant improved (P > 0.05). Pain relief was not statistically significant different between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Most patients experienced pain relief after vertebroplasty. After vertebroplasty, the height and wedge angle were significantly improved in the cleft group (p < 0.01), with no significant improvement in the non-cleft group (p > 0.05). Key Points • Vertebra with cleft is attributed to improvement of the spinal deformity • Vertebra without cleft was not associated with improvement of the spinal deformity • Vertebroplasty is an effective treatment strategy for osteoporotic compression fractures.},

Bone loss and nonvertebral fractures have been reported in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) undergoing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressive therapy. Radiological vertebral fractures (VFs) are an early and clinically crucial marker of bone fragility.
Objective and design: 
A cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence and determinants of radiological VFs in women receiving l-thyroxine (L-T4) therapy for DTC.
Patients and interventions: 
A total of 179 consecutive women (median age, 59 years; n = 178 postmenopausal) who had undergone thyroidectomy for DTC and were currently receiving L-T4 were evaluated for radiological VFs and bone mineral density (BMD). There were three TSH target levels [<0.5 mU/L, group 1 (n = 83); 0.5 to 1.0 mU/L, group 2 (n = 50); >1.0 mU/L, group 3 (n = 46)].
Results: 
VFs were found in 51 patients (28.5%), with significantly (P < 0.001) higher prevalence in group 1 (44.6%) as compared with group 2 (24.0%) and group 3 (4.3%). VF prevalence was not significantly different among patients in group 1 with normal BMD, osteopenia, or osteoporosis, whereas in groups 2 and 3, VFs were more frequent in patients with osteoporosis than in those with either osteopenia or normal BMD. In the whole population, VFs were significantly and independently associated with TSH level <1.0 mU/L; densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis at lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip; age of patients; and duration of L-T4 therapy.

  abstract={New vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are said to result from biomechanical changes induced by cementation. Fact or fiction? The reported incidences for new vertebral fractures after cementation or after conservative therapy vary widely. This is mainly due to differences in their design, more specifically as to the duration of followup. Therefore a systematic review of the literature was performed, searching for comparable publications to assess the potential risk of new vertebral fractures following vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty versus conservative treatment. Studies were only included if they granted a standardized one-year radiological follow-up, so improving comparability. However, a high degree of heterogeneity was still seen among the results, which made it impossible to state that cement augmentation is as safe as conservative treatment with respect to new fractures. In other words, it was impossible to separate facts from fiction with the studies available to-day. The combined odds ratio of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty versus conservative treatment, namely 0.96, gave a hint that there might be little difference. Large scale randomized studies will be necessary.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A histologic study of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2/calcium phosphate cement (rhBMP-2/CPC) using adult rhesus monkeys in vivo.
Objective: 
To evaluate the histologic changes of rhBMP-2/CPC in vertebroplasty and determine the feasibility of this bone substitution instead of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
Summary of background data: 
Previous studies have shown that the new rhBMP-2/nanoscale CPC has a suitable strength and injection for vertebroplasty. However, the osteoinductive properties and biodegradable characteristics are still unclear.
Methods: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was performed in 4 adult rhesus monkeys of 2 groups. Ten vertebral bodies (VBs) from T10-L7 of each rhesus were selected, and the 20 VBs in each group were randomly divided into 3 subgroups. Subgroup A (rhBMP-2/CPC): 8 VBs, filled with rhBMP-2/CPC; Subgroup B (PMMA): 6 VBs, filled with injectable PMMA; Subgroup C (control): 6 VBs, filled with normal saline. The 2 rhesus monkeys from each of the groups were killed at 2 and 6 months after operation, respectively. Individual specimens from the 40 VBs were collected for histologic observation.
Results: 
In subgroup A, radiographic and histologic observations showed that the part of the rhBMP-2/CPC cement degraded with new bone and new vessel ingrowths, into the material, after 2 months. In addition, gaps, fibrous hyperplasia, or sclerotic callus were not found in the interface. After 6 months, the cement was nearly all replaced by mature bone tissue. In subgroup B, the inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous membrane gapping were found after 2 months, and subsided partly at 6 months. But no new bone formation and material degradation were discovered. In subgroup C, the tunnels were filled with irregular new trabeculae after 2 months and unrecognizable from the surrounding mature bone after 6 months.
Conclusion: 
It is confirmed that the rhBMP-2/CPC is an osteoinductive and biodegradable material (in animal trials). It may also be an alternative to PMMA in order to achieve biostabilization in a vertebroplasty.},

Case control study.
Objective: 
To investigate the histopathologic findings of 2 retrieved specimens from failed vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty using PMMA cement has been commonly used to treat debilitating back pain from compression fracture, angiomas, and metastatic cancer. However, there was concern about the unpredictable future results with PMMA cement. The histopathologic changes were rarely reported.
Methods: 
There were 2 PMMA augmented and 3 nonaugmented fractured vertebral bodies retrieved for histopathologic study. Between the 2 groups, we compared the findings of bone necrosis, foreign body reaction, fibrotic wall formation, and neovascularization.
Results: 
Bone necrosis was noted in the periphery of PMMA cement, which was surrounded by fibrotic tissues. In contrast, no fibrotic wall formation could be found in the nonaugmented control group. Foreign body reaction was only noted in PMMA augmented cases, and neovascularization was only noted in the control cases.
Conclusion: 
PMMA cement might not be as bioinert as we considered. Therefore, the long-term safety of vertebroplasty should be further evaluated.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To identify the flexion type of hangman's fracture on imaging studies.
Methods: 
38 cases of hangman's fracture were retrospectively studied and categorized into flexion and non-flexion groups. Plain radiograph, CT and MRI of these patients were evaluated; 13 radiological parameters that might define flexion injuries were measured. The data were statistically analyzed to identify good criteria and to rank them according to their importance in predicting flexion.
Results: 
Seven radiological criteria that have the highest correlation with flexion injury were identified. These are C2-3 lower end-plate angle, C2-3 posterior body angle, interspinous angle, disc disruption (MRI), widening of interspinous distance, disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex (MRI) and angle at the fracture site. Scoring 1 point for each positive criterion, a total score of 4 predicts flexion injury with 100% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity. Score of 5 has 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
Conclusion: 
Flexion hangman's injury can be diagnosed by the presence of four out of seven radiological criteria in the newly introduced scoring system. The authors believe that this method may help spinal surgeons in their selection of therapeutic strategy. Advances in knowledge: This study introduces fast, simple and more objective imaging criteria for the diagnosis of flexion hangman's injury and separates it from the non-flexion pattern.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
This study uses data from a previously published randomised trial where balloon kyphoplasty was compared to non-surgical management. Of the improved overall quality of life, 60 % was caused by decreased pain. However, ignoring other dimensions of quality of life would underestimate the procedure's effect.
Introduction: 
Acute back pain has been viewed as the most important factor lowering quality of life (QoL) for patients suffering vertebral fractures. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of different health dimensions on overall QoL using patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) collected in Fracture Reduction Evaluation (FREE) trial.
Methods: 
The analysis was based on patients included in the 2-year-long randomised controlled FREE trial studying the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty procedure (BKP) compared to non-surgical management (NSM). The PROMs included were EQ-5D, Short Form (SF)-36, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). The health dimensional contribution to the overall QoL improvements was analysed by isolating the impact of each dimension on QoL in the SF-36 and EQ-5D, respectively. A correlation analysis of the QoL improvement was performed to investigate the relationships between the four instruments.
Results: 
Changes in pain explained 60 % of the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained in BKP vs. NSM followed by self-care (17 %), mobility (16 %) and usual activities (10 %) (EQ-5D). Health dimensions capturing the mental state had little impact on the QALY gained. The SF-36 dimensional analysis showed similar results. The correlation analysis showed that the correlation between VAS pain, RMDQ and QALY improvement was fairly weak.
Conclusions: 
Changes in the pain dimension of health are the most important drivers for changes of overall QoL in patients treated with BKP or NSM. However, ignoring the impact of other dimensions would lead to an underestimation of the actual improvement in overall QoL.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are procedures for treating vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). In August 2009, 2 randomized trials in the New England Journal of Medicine found that vertebroplasty did not reduce pain or disability relative to a sham procedure among patients with osteoporotic VCFs.
Study design: 
We evaluated quarterly trends in per capita rates of vertebroplasties and kyphoplasties using the Florida hospital inpatient discharge and ambulatory surgery center databases from 2005 to 2012, supplemented with physician specialty and population data. We reported trends by procedure type, patient diagnosis, and physician specialty. We modeled the procedures as interrupted time series with a break when the clinical trials were published, and estimated changes in procedure rates and health expenditures resulting from the trials.
Results: 
The trials led to a 51.5% decline in the per capita vertebroplasty rate and a 40.0% decline in the kyphoplasty rate (both results p < 0.010) compared with what procedure rates would have been without the trials. Vertebroplasty rates for interventional radiologists displayed no significant change; rates for surgeons and other specialists declined by 73.1% (p < 0.010). Overall, these changes imply nationwide health expenditure savings of just over $1 billion per year.
Conclusions: 
Publication of negative clinical trial results led to moderate reductions in vertebroplasties and kyphoplasties for osteoporotic VCFs. However, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty continue to be widely used to treat patients with osteoarthritis. Substantial differences in response across physicians suggest an important role for specialty society clinical guidelines in modulating how clinical evidence is incorporated into routine practice.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
It has not been clarified whether the postoperative resolution of vertebral deformities achieved by KP are superior to those achieved by VP. We compared the outcomes of KP and VP, taking into account the presence of vertebral mobility, to determine whether the balloon inflation in KP may contribute to postoperative resolution of the vertebral deformities in patients with VCFs.
Materials and methods: 
The subjects had 34 vertebral bodies treated by VP, and 43 vertebral bodies treated by KP. In all patients, preoperative dynamic imaging was performed to assess the presence of vertebral mobility. First, the vertebral height restoration and kyphotic change were compared between the VP and KP groups. Then, the patients were further divided into 2 groups on the basis of the presence of vertebral mobility, and they were compared within and between the VP and KP groups in relation to the presence of vertebral mobility.
Results: 
Overall, no significant differences were observed in either the vertebral height restoration or kyphotic change between the VP and KP groups (P > .20). Preoperative dynamic imaging identified 19 vertebral bodies each with vertebral mobility in the VP (56%) and KP groups (44%) (P = .21). Within the VP and KP groups, the vertebral height restoration and kyphotic changes were significantly better in patients with vertebral mobility than in those without (P < .01). There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups after adjustment for the presence of vertebral mobility (P > .30).
Conclusions: 
In both the VP and KP groups, the vertebral height restoration and kyphotic change largely depended on the preoperative vertebral mobility. The use of the balloon itself contributed little to resolution of the vertebral deformities.},

  abstract={Odontoid process fracture accounts for 5% to 15% of all cervical spine injuries, and the rate is higher among elderly people. The anterior cannulated screw fixation has been widely used in odontoid process fracture, but the fixation strength may still be limited under some circumstances. This study aims to investigate the biomechanical fixation strength of expansive double-threaded bi-directional compression screw (EDBCS) compared with cannulated lag screw (CLS) and improved Herbert screw (IHS) for fixation of type II odontoid process fracture.Thirty fresh cadaveric C2 vertebrae specimens were harvested and randomly divided into groups A, B, and C. A type II fracture model was simulated by osteotomy. Then the specimens of the 3 groups were stabilized with a single CLS, IHS, or EDBCS, respectively. Each specimen was tested in torsion from 0° to 1.25° for 75 s in each of 5 cycles clockwise and 5 cycles anticlockwise. Shear and tensile forces were applied at the anterior-to-posterior and proximal-to-distal directions, respectively, both to a maximum load of 45 N and at a speed of 1 mm/min.The mean torsional stiffness was 0.309 N m/deg for IHS and 0.389 N m/deg for EDBCS, which were significantly greater compared with CLS, respectively (0.169 N m/deg) (P < .05 and P < .05). The mean shear stiffness for the EDBCS was 238 N/mm, which was significantly greater than CLS (150 N/mm) and IHS (132 N/mm) (P < .05 and P < .05). All 3 screws only partly restored tensile stiffness, but not significantly.Fixation with the EDBCS can improve the biomechanical strength for odontoid process fracture compared with CLS and IHS, especially in terms of torsional and shear stiffness.},

Retrospective database analysis.
Objective: 
To examine the incidence of hospitalization, treatment, and cost of caring for patients with axis (C2) fractures.
Summary of background data: 
The incidence of C2 fractures in the elderly seems to be increasing, however, a comprehensive analysis of the incidence, treatment, and cost of treating C2 fractures has not been previously reported.
Methods: 
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2010 was used to identify patients with C2 fracture without neurological injury (International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 805.02). Examined variables included age, International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification injury severity score, comorbidities, mortality, hospital length of stay, treatments, and total inpatient hospitalization charge. Charges were adjusted for inflation to 2010 US dollars as well as for cost-to-charge ratios.
Results: 
In total, 31,129 patients with C2 fracture were identified. From 2000 to 2010 the incidence of C2 fracture hospitalization increased in all age groups (P < 0.0001). The most rapid increase was in patients older than 84 years, who experienced a 3-fold increase from 3.18 to 9.77 hospitalizations per 10,000 individuals per year (P < 0.0001). From 2000 to 2010, the rate of halo vest placement decreased from 25.2% to 10.4% (P < 0.0001), whereas the rate of surgical intervention increased from 13.1% to 16.5% (P = 0.029). For nonoperatively treated patients, the mean hospitalization charge per patient increased from $39,346 in 2000 to $63,222 in 2010, and for surgically treated patients, it increased from $70,784 in 2000 to $133,064 in 2010 (P < 0.0001). During the decade, the estimated charges for annual inpatient care for patients with C2 fracture in the United States increased 4.7-fold from $334,138,919 to $1,577,254,958 (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: 
The incidence of C2 fracture hospitalizations increased dramatically from 2000 to 2010, with the most rapid increase in the elderly represented by a greater than 3-fold increase for patients older than 84 years. The inpatient charges for treating C2 fractures have risen faster than the increased incidence, with a 4.7-fold increase in hospital charges resulting in estimated annual charges of more than $1.5 billion in 2010.

  abstract={Purpose: 
To identify the incidence of new vertebral compression fractures in women after kyphoplasty and to analyze influential factors in these patients.
Materials and methods: 
One hundred and eleven consecutive female patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) underwent kyphoplasty at 137 levels. These patients were followed for 15.2 months postoperatively. For the survey of new vertebral compression fractures, medical records and x-rays were reviewed, and telephone interviews were conducted with all patients.
Results: 
During that time 20 (18%) patients developed new VCFs. The rate of occurrence of new VCFs in one year was 15.5% using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Body mass index (BMI), symptom duration and kyphoplasty level were the statistically significant factors between the patient groups both with and without new VCFs after kyphoplasty. In the comparison between the adjacent and remote new VCF groups, the adjacent new VCF group showed a larger amount of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) use during kyphoplasty (p<0.05). Before kyphoplasty, 9.9% of the patients had been prescribed medication for osteoporosis, and 93.7% of the patients started or continued medication after kyphoplasty. The development of new VCFs was affected by the number of vertebrae involved in the kyphoplasty. However, the lower incidence rate (15.5%) of new compression fractures might be due to a greater percentage (93.7% in our study) of patients taking anti-osteoporotic medication before and/or after kyphoplasty.
Conclusion: 
When kyphoplasty is planned for the management of patients with osteoporotic VCFs, the application of a small amount of PMMA can be considered in order to lower the risk of new fractures in adjacent vertebrae. The postoperative use of anti- osteoporotic medication is recommended for the prevention of new VCFs.},

  abstract={The causal relationship between vertebroplasty and new-onset vertebral fractures remains unproved. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess whether vertebroplasty increases the incidence of new vertebral fractures and adjacent vertebral fractures. A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2013 was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients receiving vertebroplasty. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and heterogeneity was assessed with both the chi-squared test and the I(2) test. Four studies with a total of 454 patients met the inclusion criteria. All four studies described the incidence of new vertebral fractures and three studies described adjacent vertebral fractures. The pooled results revealed that vertebroplasty was not associated with a significant increase in the incidence of new vertebral fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.75-1.67; p=0.59) or adjacent vertebral fractures (RR 2.31, 95% CI 0.36-15.06; p=0.38). Based on available evidence, it cannot be concluded that vertebroplasty can significantly increase the postoperative rate of new vertebral fractures and adjacent vertebral fractures. However, due to some limitations, the results of this meta-analysis should be cautiously accepted, but further studies are needed.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To determine whether vertebroplasty increases the risk of new (ie, incident) vertebral fractures by comparing the rates of incident fractures among a group of patients with painful vertebral fractures who did not undergo vertebroplasty with a group of patients who did.
Materials and methods: 
A retrospective chart review was performed to identify new-onset fractures after initial vertebroplasty evaluation in two groups, including patients who underwent vertebroplasty within 1 week of initial evaluation (group 1) and those who did not (group 2). Group 2 was further limited to patients with acute or subacute prevalent fractures (group 2A) after exclusion of those with exclusively chronic prevalent fractures. Survival analyses were performed to compare time to diagnosis and frequency of incident fractures in these three groups of patients.
Results: 
Group 1 included 269 patients, group 2 included 107 patients, and group 2A included 82 patients. Compared with group 2, incident fractures in group 1 occurred significantly earlier (log-rank statistic, 0.01) and more frequently (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-8.4).
Conclusions: 
Among patients with acute or subacute vertebral fractures presenting for consideration of vertebroplasty, those who undergo the procedure experience more and earlier incident fractures than those who do not, but the observed differences failed to reach statistical significance. Further work is needed in this area to better define relative risks of incident fracture between treated and nontreated patients.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To analyze the clinical efficacy and cement leakage rate of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for the treatment of metastatic vertebral lesions between the two groups using different cement infusion techniques.
Methods: 
One hundred twenty-nine patients (160 metastatic vertebral fractures) who chose "the incremental temperature cement delivery technique" (ITCDT group) and 105 patients (128 metastatic vertebral fractures) who chose "traditional infusion technique" (TI group) were finally enrolled (nine patients were lost to the follow-up). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the local Cobb's angle, the relative height of the vertebral anterior border, and cement leakage were analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the two cement infusion techniques within postoperative 12 months.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in the VAS scores, ODI scores, the relative height of the vertebral anterior border, and local Cobb's angle between the ITCDT group and TI group preoperatively and postoperatively ( p > 0.05). The cement leakage occurred in three patients of ITCDT group (2.3%), which was significantly less than TI group (12 patients, 11.4%; p < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
The ITCDT and TI technique in kyphoplasty are effective at relieving pain and improving functional disability, vertebral height, and kyphosis angle; However, kyphoplasty using the ITCDT causes less cement leakage significantly.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective review of prospectively collected databases of 139 consecutive patients who underwent transoral surgery for lesions of the upper cervical spine.
Objective: 
To analyze the incidence and risk factors of local infection after transoral surgery for the craniocervical junction in a single institution and to compare the findings with the literature.
Summary of background data: 
One of the primary risks associated with transoral approach for lesions in the upper cervical spine is postoperative surgical wound infection.
Methods: 
From April 1994 to December 2012, 139 consecutive transoral surgical procedures were performed at a single referral center. The mean age at presentation was 53.6 years (range: 5-87 yr), and more than half of the patients were males (58.3%). The majority of cases were experiencing rheumatic diseases (43.9%), whereas tumor destruction was the indication for surgery in 23.7% of the cases. A total of 23% had fracture of the upper cervical spine and primary infection was found in 7 patients (5%). The mean follow-up period was 4.5 years.
Results: 
Infection of the pharyngeal wound occurred in 5 patients (3.6%), solely in the rheumatic and tumor groups. The presentation was mostly in the first 4 months. A single patient with cage reconstruction after giant cell tumor C2 presented with a late infection 5 years postoperatively. Debridement and primary closure was possible in 2 patients, whereas flap coverage of the pharyngeal wall was necessary in 3 patients. The presence of implant did not have a statistically significant effect on the occurrence of infection. However, infection in the presence of titanium cage mostly necessitated flap coverage of the pharyngeal wall after removal of the cage.
Conclusion: 
The transoral route has proved to be an invaluable method of approaching pathological lesions in the upper cervical spine. The infection rate in this work was 3.6%. Patients with rheumatic diseases and patients presenting with tumors were more susceptible to postoperative surgical wound infection.
Level of evidence: 
4.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A case of inferior vena cava syndrome following percutaneous vertebroplasty is described herein.
Objective: 
To alert clinicians to the potential occurrence of inferior vena cava syndrome following percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty is a less invasive treatment solution for the osteoporotic compression fracture. There complications of the cement leakage would appear to have been rather infrequent. We report a case of inferior vena cava syndrome related to the cement leakage.
Methods: 
A 59-year-old woman underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for painful T11, L1, L2, and L3 compression fractures, under general anesthesia at a community hospital. A contralateral transpedicular approach was made in order to inject polymethylmethacrylate resin into the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
Just subsequent to surgery, this patient developed dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia, and progressive right lower-limb pain, redness, and swelling., conservative treatment being then undertaken, albeit in vain. One week after the attempted remediation of this patient's condition, she was transferred to our hospital for further management. After admission, radiography of the patient's lumbar spine (lateral view) revealed multiple cement leakage in the area of the posterior longitudinal ligament and also in the anterior paravertebral area. The abdominal and pelvic CT scan and venography revealed vertebroplasty cement leakage into the lumbar vein, the left renal vein, and the inferior vena cava. Thrombosis at the left common iliac vein and left femoral vein were noted with extension into the inferior part of the inferior vena cava. Intravenous heparin was then administered to our patient for the ensuing 20 days, at which time heparin was replaced by warfarin, in order to attempt to prevent progressive venous thrombosis. The patient's leg edema appeared to improve 10 weeks subsequent to her surgery, she then being able to perambulate using a rigid walker.
Conclusion: 
This case illustrates the need for clinicians to be critically aware of the potential occurrence of inferior vena cava syndrome among patients who have undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty, especially when multiple levels of vertebra are injected as part of the vertebroplasty procedure.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Controlled in vitro trial.
Objective: 
To study vertebral strength in relation to cement augmentation technique after vertebroplasty and to assess the influence of the biomechanical compression model on postoperative results.
Summary of background data: 
In the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, the role of vertebroplasty has been well established. Biomechanical compression models thus far used, compressing vertebrae by only 25% of their initial height, did not show a correlation between cement augmentation volumes and postoperative compression strength. In these studies, even very small volumes of cement seem effective. However, these models may not realistically simulate clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures. We hypothesize that, in clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures, postoperative vertebral body strength is strongly dependent on endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation.
Methods: 
Twenty-five intact osteoporotic cadaver vertebrae were obtained (10 lumbar, 15 thoracic). In 21 vertebrae, anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created by controlled external force, with preset height reduction by 35%. After height reconstruction, 9 vertebrae were augmented endplate-to-endplate and 12 vertebrae were partially augmented with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Another 4 vertebrae were compressed by only 25%. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol.
Results: 
In the 35% compression group, posttreatment strength was significantly decreased in vertebrae that were partially augmented with cement compared with the endplate-to-endplate augmented group (767 +/- 257 N vs. 1141 +/- 325 N, P < 0.01). Postoperative strength amounted 106% +/- 27% of preoperative strength values in the endplate-to-endplate augmented vertebrae, compared with 65% +/- 18% in the partially augmented vertebrae (P < 0.001). In the 25% compression group, results in height restored and augmented vertebrae were similar to the nontreated vertebrae.
Conclusions: 
Endplate-to-endplate PMMA augmentation restores the biomechanical properties of vertebrae in clinically relevant anterior wedge fractures. Our preliminary data suggest that biomechanical models with only 25% compressive deformation unlikely form a good model to assess the mechanical effects of cement augmentation in osteoporotic fractures.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To study incidence and radiological features of intravertebral cleft (IVC) in patients with chronic pain due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs), and analyze influence of IVC for surgery of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
Methods: 
Seventy-six patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and pain duration more than one month were underwent procedures of PKP between August 2005 and August 2010. The incidence and radiological features of IVC were analyzed. Sixty-one patients with single-level OVCFs were divided into two groups with and without IVC. Preoperative and postoperative kyphotic angle and relative anterior vertebral height were recorded, as well as visual analogue scales (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). Cement patterns of opacification and leakage were also recorded.
Results: 
Thirty two patients with 39 vertebrates were found with IVC sign. The diagnostic sensitivity of X ray, CT and MRI for IVC was respectively 33.3%, 85.7% and 84.6%. Two groups with IVC and without IVC both had apparent correction of kyphotic angle and reduction of anterior height at 3 days after surgery and last follow-up (F = 21.82 - 72.18, P < 0.01). There was no statistical significance between two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, both groups had significant improvement as regard to VAS and ODI (F = 131.06 - 364.12, P < 0.01). Solid pattern accounted for 72.0% of all cemented vertebrates in the group with IVC and 19.4% in the group without IVC. Four cement leakage were found in the group with IVC and another four in the group without IVC.
Conclusions: 
There is a high incidence of IVC in patients with chronic pain due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. CT and MRI are sensitive for detection of IVC. The procedure of PKP is effective for both groups with and without IVC. IVC produces an apparent influence on cement opacification and leakage location during the procedure of PKP.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Biomechanical comparison of the risk of proximal junctional fracture (PJF) after multilevel spinal instrumentation using pedicle screws or transverse process hooks on the top of a pedicle screw construct.
Objective: 
To compare the loads leading to PJF when using pedicle screws or transverse process hooks at the proximal level after multilevel spinal instrumentation using pedicle screws.
Summary of background data: 
With stronger spinal fixation techniques, there is increased risk of PJF, especially in the osteoporotic spine. The use of transverse process hooks over pedicle screws at the proximal level of multilevel pedicle screw constructs has been proposed to decrease the incidence of PJF. However, there is no biomechanical study evaluating this concept.
Methods: 
Twenty-four segments of 4 vertebrae from 6 human cadaveric spines were evaluated after instrumentation of the distal 3 vertebrae using pedicle screws, except at the top of the construct where either pedicle screws (AP group) or transverse process hooks (PTPH group) were placed. The proximal vertebra was left uninstrumented. Quantitative computed tomography scan was used before instrumentation in order to assess the bone density for each specimen. Cyclic compression loading between 50 and 1000 N at 1 Hz was applied to each of 24 instrumented spinal segments until obtaining a PJF.
Results: 
Bone density was similar between the AP and PTPH groups. A PJF occurred in 22 of 24 tested specimens. The number of cycles required to produce the PJF ranged between 2 and 1002. The number of cycles required to produce the PJF was similar between the AP construct group (median: 3; interquartile range: 3-7) and the PTPH construct group (median: 4; interquartile range: 3-5).
Conclusions: 
The current study failed to observe a significant impact of using transverse process hooks over pedicle screws on top of multilevel pedicle screw construct to decrease the risk of PJF.},

Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) change the natural spinal alignment and inevitably lead to a decreased quality of life.
Objective: 
The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in pulmonary function after VCF were treated by radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RF-TVA).
Methods: 
Twenty-five patients were treated with RF-TVA and analyzed in 3 subgroups taking into account the spinal location of the VCF. Pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI), vertebral height, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were assessed before, directly after and 30 days after RF-TVA.
Results: 
The mean vertebral height was improved in all subgroups, with a minor reduction from one to 30 days postoperatively. The mean VAS and ODI significantly decreased in the main and upper diaphragm groups from baseline to the follow-up after 30 days. Patients treated below the main diaphragm region showed a significant improvement of ODI and a clear trend to significant improvements of VAS. PEF and FEV1 were significantly improved in the main diaphragm group. FEV1 also increased significantly in the upper diaphragm group with a clear trend to significance in the lower diaphragm group.
Conclusions: 
Results indicate that RF-TVA may improve pulmonary function especially in cases where fractures are located in the main spinal region of the diaphragm.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To observe the influence on adjacent lumbar bone density after strengthening of T12, L1 segment vertebral osteoporotic compression fracture by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in postmenopausal female.
Methods: 
Between January 2008 and June 2011, 59 patients with T12, L1 segment thoracolumbar osteoporotic compression fracture were treated with PVP in 29 cases (PVP group) and PKP in 30 cases (PKP group), who were in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. No significant difference was found in gender, duration of menopause, disease druation, causes of injury, fractured vertebral body, and vertebral fracture classification between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The kyphosis Cobb angle of surgical area was measured at preoperation, 1 week after operation, and last follow-up; the lower three lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) of the surgical area, the femoral neck BMD, and body mass index (BMI) of patients were measured at perioperative period and last follow-up to find out the statement of anti-osteoporosis; FRAX online tools were used to evaluate the probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture of the next 10 years.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 25.5 months (range, 12-48 months) in 2 groups. There was significant difference in kyphosis Cobb angle of T12, L1 between preoperation and last follow-up in 2 groups (P < 0.05); the Cobb angle of PKP group was significantly less than that of PVP group at 1 week after operation and last follow-up (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in BMI between 2 groups, and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05). The lower three lumbar spine BMD of the surgical area and its T value at last follow-up was improved significantly when compared with BMD at perioperative period (P < 0.05); there was no significant difference in the lower three lumbar spine BMD and its T value between 2 groups at perioperative period (P > 0.05), but significant difference was found between two groups at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Difference was not significant in the femoral neck BMD and its T value between 2 groups, and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05). The probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture of the next 10 years was not significantly different between 2 groups and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The increased BMD of adjacent lumbar spine can improve the strength of the vertebral body and reduce the incidence of adjacent vertebral fracture in patients with T12, L1 segment vertebral osteoporotic compression fracture after PVP/PKP, and PKP is superior to PVP increasing BMD of adjacent lumbar spine.},

  abstract={Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive surgical procedures that have recently been introduced for the medical management of osteoporosis-induced vertebral compression fractures. The aim of VP is to stabilize the fractured vertebral body, while the goals of KP are to stabilize the fractured vertebral body and to restore its height to as near its prefracture level as possible. Both procedures involve injection of the setting dough of an injectable bone cement (IBC) into the fractured vertebral body, thereby highlighting the indispensable role that the IBC plays. Although there is a very large literature on IBCs, no detailed critical review of it has been published. Such a review is the subject of the present work, which is in seven parts. The review opens with a succinct introduction to VP and KP. The topics covered in the parts that follow are: (1) a listing of the 18 most desirable properties of an IBC (e.g., easy injectability, high radiopacity, and a resorption rate that is neither too high nor too low); (2) descriptions of the four classes of IBCs (calcium phosphates, acrylic bone cements, calcium sulfates, and composites); (3) concerns that have been raised with regard to the use of IBCs (such as the potential for thermal necrosis of tissue at the peri-augmentation site, when an acrylic bone cement is used); (4) explicative summaries of the main findings of literature studies on the influence of nine factors (such as powder particle size, powder-to-liquid ratio, and the method used to mix the powder and the liquid) on the values of various properties of IBCs; (5) explicative summaries of the main findings of literature studies on five fundamental matters, such as the aging mechanism of the powder, the thermokinetics of a setting dough, and the influence of the type of IBC used on various ex vivo biomechanical performance measures of VP- and KP-augmented vertebral bodies; and (6) descriptions of topics in six areas for future research, such as the determination of an overall index of the fatigue performance of an IBC and the development of internationally recognized standardized testing protocols to employ when a synthetic cancellous bone void model is used in the rapid in vitro screening of IBCs. The review ends with a summary of the most salient points and observations made.},

  abstract={The incidence of osteoporotic bone fractures is growing exponentially as the western population ages and as life expectancy increases. Vertebroplasty, where acrylic or calcium phosphate cement is injected into the weakened vertebrae to augment them, is an emerging procedure for treating spinal fragility fractures. However, cement injection is currently limited because there are no clear standards for a safe, reproducible and predictable procedure. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role that bone cements play in the underlying bio-mechanisms that affect the outcomes of cement injection. Our most important finding after combining clinical, laboratory and theoretical research is that the process of cement injection poses conflicting demands on bone cements. The cements are required to be more viscous and less viscous at the same time. The challenge therefore is to develop biomaterials, techniques and/or devices that can overcome or manage the conflicting demands on cement viscosity.},

  abstract={Background: 
Injuries of the thoracolumbar spine in children are rare and challenging for the treating physician. Besides knowledge of fracture treatment, the anatomical particularities of the spine in children are of great importance.
Methods: 
The article gives an overview of the diagnosis and therapy with the most common classification of injuries of the thoracolumbar spine.
Results: 
Taking into account the children's age and the fracture morphology most cases can be treated conservatively, especially because the young spine has great potential for remodelling. The older the child becomes, the more smoothly the transition to adult treatment occurs; thus, unstable fractures should be treated with surgery.
Conclusion: 
The difficult indication and the specific characteristics of surgery necessitate treatment in a spine centre with experience with surgery on children.},

  abstract={Pelvic fracture, especially in combination with multiple trauma, can still lead to ife-threatening situations. Only clear inclusion criteria and decisions can ensure survival of the patient, the key task being mechanical stabilization using external fixators or pelvic clamps with or without surgical intervention for hemostasis. The basis for problem-orientated management is a precise classification, which is based on conventional X-rays in emergency situations and detailed analysis of computed tomography for the planning of definitive surgical interventions. The classification groups postulated are stable pelvic fractures (type A), rotational unstable pelvic fractures (type B -- partial stability of the posterior ring present), and translational instabilities (type C -- with a complete disruption of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring). This classification leads to clear indications for pelvic ring stabilization as surgical interventions are only exceptionally indicated in type A fractures, stabilization of the anterior ring is sufficient for type B fractures, and combined posterior and anterior stabilization is necessary for treatment of type C fractures. Following these concepts and by using standardized procedures and implants, the high rate of enclosed anatomical healing can be achieved even after type C injuries. Nevertheless, the role of concomitant soft tissue injuries and scar formation is not clear as the origin of the frequently observed long-term clinical impairments even after anatomical reconstruction of the osteoligamentous structures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Intraoperative imaging during spinal interventions has experienced significant developments over the last two decades. By the introduction of flat screen detectors, 3D imaging has been made possible and easier and by developing compact and mobile systems computed tomography can even be used in the operating theater.
Objective: 
Presentation of modern intraoperative 3D imaging and navigation in spinal surgery.
Material and methods: 
The techniques of intraoperative 3D imaging and navigation during spinal procedures are presented based on the currently available literature and own experiences at a German national spine and trauma center.
Results: 
The use of flat panel detectors and the possibility of 3D visualization nowadays substantially facilitate the use of navigation and allow certain control of surgical results even during the intervention. Radiation exposure of the whole team in the operating theater can be significantly reduced by the new techniques.
Conclusion: 
The advantages of intraoperative 3D imaging with a clear improvement of visualization for spinal surgeons and the certain control of materials at the end of the operation are obvious. Even the use of navigation has been greatly simplified and can therefore lead to an even greater precision and less radiation exposure. There are even more sophisticated developments, such as operation suites and intraoperative computed tomography but these are initially reserved for selected centers.},

To assess the safety and efficacy of intraosseous lidocaine (IL), in comparison with iv nalbuphine and propacetamol (NP) for analgesia during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) in order to avoid general anesthesia in elderly patients.
Methods: 
Patients (age 68 +/- 13 yr, weight 66 +/- 6 kg) undergoing PV for osteoporotic fractures were randomized prospectively into two groups: NP (n=50) and IL (n=50). All patients were premedicated (oral hydroxyzine 1 mg.kg(-1)) and had skin infiltration with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine prior to vertebral puncture. Thirty minutes before the procedure, Group NP received, in a blinded manner, 50 mL of iv nalbuphine (0.3 mg.kg(-1)) and propacetamol (30 mg.kg(-1)) while Group IL received 50 mL of iv saline. During vertebral puncture, Groups NP and IL received, in a blinded manner, 1 mL.10 kg(-1) of intraosseous saline and 1% lidocaine respectively. Pain was assessed during vertebral puncture and cement injection with a four-point verbal rating scale. Additionally, lidocaine plasma kinetics were obtained in 11 IL patients.
Results: 
Analgesic efficacy was similar in the IL and NP groups (85 vs 84%). Group NP had more side effects. Lidocaine peak recorded concentration was 2.6 +/- 0.1 microg.mL(-1) i.e., about three times less than the reported toxic limits.
Conclusion: 
IL is as effective as the association of iv NP for analgesia in PV. However, considering that both protocols were insufficient in about 15% of cases, other modalities are needed to further improve analgesia and avoid general anesthesia during vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Intravertebral clefts have long been considered as pathognomonic for avascular necrosis and as a rare cause of compression fracture. We have observed unsuspected clefts opacifying frequently during vertebroplasty. Our purpose in this study was to determine the incidence of these clefts in symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures, assess the sensitivity of MR imaging and conventional radiography in the detection of these clefts, and determine whether there is any prognostic significance of these clefts in patients treated with vertebroplasty.
Methods: 
Retrospective chart reviews were conducted of 135 vertebroplasty procedures performed during a 2-year period. MR images and conventional radiographs were reviewed for the presence of clefts defined as fluid-filled cavities on MR images or gas-filled cavities on conventional radiographs. Digital radiographs obtained at the time of the procedure were inspected for the presence of opacified clefts. Imaging findings were correlated with subjective pain scores documented before the procedure and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after vertebroplasty.
Results: 
Two hundred thirty-six osteoporotic compression fractures were treated with polymethylmethacrylate in 125 patients. Thirty-one and eight-tenths percent of the fractures were noted to contain clefts at the time of vertebroplasty. Fluid-filled clefts were detected on preoperative MR images in only 52.8% of the fractures with opacified clefts at vertebroplasty. Gas-filled clefts were evident on preoperative conventional radiographs in only 11.4% of the fractures with opacified clefts at vertebroplasty. No significant difference was noted in numerical pain scores between the two populations at baseline or 1 week or 1 month after the procedure. Pain scores at 6 and 12 months after vertebroplasty showed a trend toward greater pain relief in patients with clefts, although the difference was not statistically significant. A sustained, statistically significant decrease in pain scores after treatment (P <.01) was noted in both groups.
Conclusion: 
Intravertebral clefts are much more common than previously described and probably represent fracture nonunions. Imaging is not sensitive in detecting these clefts before vertebroplasty. We advocate complete filling of the cleft with cement during vertebroplasty to maximize stabilization of the fracture fragments. There is a trend toward greater pain relief being achieved 6 and 12 months after the procedure in patients with clefts that are opacified at the time of vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To perform a detailed analysis of blinding efficacy in the Investigational Vertebroplasty Efficacy and Safety Trial (INVEST) to determine any factors associated with patient unblinding.
Materials and methods: 
One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved trial and were randomized to vertebroplasty (n = 68) or control intervention (n = 63). At multiple times up to 1 month, patients guessed their treatment allocation (vertebroplasty or control) with a forced-choice response. Patients offered a confidence level (scale, 0-10) for each guess and, when possible, a reason for their guess. Univariable logistic regression models were used to test for an association between baseline characteristics of the patients and correctly guessing their randomized treatment assignment. A two-sample t test was used to determine whether change in pain score differed between patients who guessed their treatment was vertebroplasty versus those who guessed their treatment was control intervention. Qualitative reasons for guesses were tabulated according to treatment assignment and guess.
Results: 
Recruitment site was the only baseline factor significantly associated with guessing treatment correctly at 14 days (P < .01). Between the control and vertebroplasty groups, a total of 54 patients offered 64 reasons for their guesses, with 16 (25%) reasons based on procedural experiences. Control patients guessing vertebroplasty had significantly greater pain improvement at days 14 and 30 than did those guessing control (day 14, P = .02; day 30, P < .001). In the vertebroplasty group, no relationship between change in pain and patient guess was noted.
Conclusion: 
A number of factors were associated with the ability of patients to guess their treatment allocation correctly-namely, treatment effect (in the control group only), study treatment site, and baseline pain duration. Procedural experiences rarely affected perceived treatment in INVEST.},

Participants in both trials are representative of patients seen in clinical practice and who would qualify for government-subsidised funding of vertebroplasty in Australia. Clinical experience and previous published literature are likely to have overestimated the treatment benefit of vertebroplasty for many reasons. This is why randomised placebo-controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of treatment interventions, particularly when the condition being treated is self-limiting and the primary end point is improvement of symptoms. Based on the best evidence currently available, the routine use of vertebroplasty outside of the research setting for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures appears unjustified.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures are not commonly seen in clinical practice. Some articles have been published showing the outcome of vertebroplasty (PV) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), but few comparative studies have been performed.
Purpose: 
To compare the effect and safety of PV and BKP in treating osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures.
Material and methods: 
In this retrospective comparative study, 38 patients with osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures were treated by PV, and 41 patients were treated by BKP from May 2005 to July 2011. The heights of the compromised vertebral body and the kyphotic angles were measured. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to evaluate pain and functional activity, respectively. The occurrence of refracture and cement leakage were determined, and the costs were recorded.
Results: 
The mean VAS and ODI scores significantly improved for both procedures at postsurgical measurements (P < 0.05), and the improvement sustained at the final follow-up. In both groups, there were no significant differences in terms of restoration of the anterior vertebral height and correction of the kyphotic deformity. However, BKP was more effective in restoring the middle vertebral height than PV. Cement leakages were observed in nine (23.7%) treated vertebral bodies in PV group and in three (7.4%) treated vertebral bodies in BKP group, which was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). There were four new osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the PV group and two in the BKP group during the follow-up period. The mean cost in the BKP group (6200 ± 122.1 USD) was higher than the PV group (2100 ± 112.5 USD) (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Both PV and BKP achieved similar improvements in pain and functional outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures. BKP had a significant advantage over PV in terms of the restoration of the middle vertebral height and fewer cement leakages than PV.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective chart review.
Objectives: 
The objective of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between neurological deficits and the severity of narrowing of the spinal canal in patients with thoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbar burst-type fractures by comparing the classifications of Denis and Magerl. From 1989 to 2005, a total of 227 patients with burst fractures following Denis' criteria were studied.
Setting: 
Tertiary teaching institution.
Methods: 
Computed tomographic scans of the fractured spine were analyzed to assess the narrowing of the spinal canal. Following Magerl's criteria, patients were later subdivided into two groups according to the presence of associated ligament injuries, out of which 185 patients had no such injuries and the remaining 42 patients were classified as Megerl group B.
Results: 
Results were evaluated based on the initial neurological status of patients according to Frankel and based on the midsagittal diameter of the fractured vertebra. A significant correlation was found between the narrowing of the spinal canal and neurological deficits in both classifications, with no significant differences between either.
Conclusion: 
The percentage of narrowing of the spinal canal proved to be a pre-disposing factor for the severity of the neurological status in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst-type fractures according to the classifications of Denis and Magerl. The greater the bone fragment in the spinal canal, the greater will be the probability of neurological deficits in both fracture classifications, equally.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compressed fractures (VCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures. Although percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) reportedly relieves pain and improves function, a recent pooled analysis from two multicenter randomized controlled trials concluded the improvement in pain and disability treated with PVP was similar to those with sham surgery.
Questions::Purpose: 
Using meta-analysis we therefore asked whether compared with either nonoperative therapy or a sham injection for patients with VCF, PVP would (1) better relieve pain, (2) provide greater improvement in pain-related disability, and (3) increase the recurrence of vertebral fractures.
Methods: 
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane library using the keywords "vertebroplasty AND osteoporosis OR fracture". We included nine of the 469 articles identified. Using a random effects model, we calculated the weighted mean differences to evaluate the pain reduction at different times as the primary outcome. Pain-related disability was assessed by a quality of life (QOL) measure. Improvement of QOL and recurrence of vertebral fractures were the secondary outcomes. We used subgroup analysis to reinvestigate pain relief and function improvement of PVP based on two different controls: nonoperative therapy and sham injection. The total number of patients was 886.
Results: 
Pain scoring was similar between the PVP group and the sham injection group at 1 to 29 days and 90 days. However, compared with nonoperative therapy, PVP reduced pain at all times studied. QOL in the PVP group was improved or tended to be improved compared with QOL for both control groups. The risk of new fractures was similar between the PVP groups and both control groups.
Conclusions: 
Different control groups may have accounted for the different conclusions in the literature regarding the ability of PVP to relieve pain and restore function recovery. Compared with nonoperative treatment PVP relieved pain better and improved QOL. PVP did not increase the risk of new fractures.
Level of evidence: 
Level II, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

In our paper, we systemically retrieved the eligible study evaluating whether increased incidence of subsequent vertebral fracture is associated with vertebroplasty. Main effect sizes were vertebral fracture rates reported in terms of hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event data or relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcome. Our results do not support the hypothesis that vertebroplasty contributes to increased risk of subsequent vertebral fracture, neither adjacent nor total vertebral fracture.
Introduction: 
Vertebroplasty has been implicated in significant changes in vertebral strength, vertebral shape, and consequently increased risk for subsequent vertebral fracture, especially the adjacent level. Here, we further tested the hypothesis whether new-onset vertebral fracture is a natural result of osteoporosis or consequence of cement augmentation.
Methods: 
Relevant literatures were retrieved using PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), supplemented by a hand-search of the reference lists of selected articles. Eligible studies assessed whether increased morbidity of subsequent vertebral fracture is associated with vertebroplasty. Main effect sizes were vertebral fracture rates reported in terms of hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event data or relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcome. Random-effects model was used to account for clinical or methodological heterogeneity across studies.
Results: 
Thirteen studies with a number of 2,551 individuals (1,631 in vertebroplasty group and 920 in control group) were suitable for this meta-analysis. In trials that reported adjacent vertebral fracture as time-to-event data (two trials, n = 328), we found a similar incidence of vertebral fracture in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) group compared to conservative therapy (HR 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 1.26; P = 0.18). In trials that reported overall vertebral fracture as time-to-event data (three trials, n = 704), vertebroplasty was associated with a slightly increased but non-significant risk for vertebral fracture (HR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 2.00; P = 0.65). The outcome was further confirmed in the secondary meta-analysis of studies that reported vertebral fracture as dichotomous data. Subgroup analysis according to study design revealed no difference either.
Conclusions: 
Our results do not support the hypothesis that vertebroplasty contributes to increased risk of subsequent vertebral fracture, neither adjacent nor total vertebral fracture. However, adequately designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the present findings.},

  abstract={Delayed post-traumatic osteonecrosis, also known by its eponym Kummell's disease, is a rarely reported clinical entity that likely occurs with higher frequency than recognized. We highlight a case of a 75-year-old female household ambulator who presented with significant thoracolumbar pain and delayed T12 collapse after a ground-level fall. The patient had sustained a trivial fall at home 4 months prior to this presentation and had been hospitalized in our institution at that time for a general medical workup. Dedicated spine radiographs were not obtained during this visit. However, lateral chest radiograph demonstrated an intact T12 vertebral body. The patient was able to mobilize successfully with therapy and was discharged home. During the interim between the initial fall and subsequent presentation, she resumed physical activity including ambulating independently and performing various housework. Approximately 4 months following her initial injury, the patient returned to a local emergency department with vague complaints of abdominal pain without any history of recent fall or injury. After an unremarkable workup, the patient was sent home. Ten days later, she represented to our institution's emergency room with worsening pain. Radiographs and CT scan demonstrated interval collapse of the T12 vertebral body. A linear vacuum cleft was noted on X-rays and CT. An extensive workup to exclude other processes such as malignancy or infection, which was negative, ensued. Delayed post-traumatic vertebral collapse was diagnosed. A trial of medical management and therapy was attempted, but she continued to experience significant pain. A T12 vertebroplasty was therefore offered and performed to stabilize the injury and to relieve the pain. She was subsequently able to be discharged from the hospital and transitioned back to home life. At approximately 2 years following her injury, the patient was noted to be able to ambulate with a walking aid. Her final radiograph after her surgery demonstrated that the T12 vertebroplasty had maintained its height and sagittal alignment. This Grand Round case highlights the clinical presentation of Kummell's disease. Aspects of the clinical entity that will be discussed include a historical review of the disease, hallmark radiographic findings and treatment options.},

  abstract={Background: 
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty using the data presented in recently published papers with respect to pain relief, function, complication rate, and incidence of new vertebral fractures.
Methods: 
Detailed searches for English-language and German-language articles published between 2002 and 2009 were performed in a number of electronic databases. Because of the large number of case series, we considered only systematic reviews and controlled studies. The internal validity of reviews and studies was judged by two authors independently. Data extraction was performed by one author, and extracted data were checked for completeness and correctness by a second author.
Results: 
A total of eight systematic reviews, primarily summarizing results from case series, and 11 controlled studies, two of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were included. Both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty significantly reduce pain in the majority of patients and can lead to short-term and possibly long-term improvement of function. Kyphoplasty induces fewer clinically relevant complications than vertebroplasty does, and there is presently stronger evidence for its efficacy compared with vertebroplasty. There is inconclusive evidence about the risk of new fractures after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
Conclusion: 
Both procedures seem to be equally effective, but kyphoplasty is safer than vertebroplasty. New results, specifically from RCTs comparing the two procedures, are needed to provide more definitive data.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To determine, on the basis of the available literature, whether kyphoplasty is a safe technique for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that leads to functional improvement in the patient's activities of daily living.
Design: 
Review of the literature. METHOD. Publications on the results of kyphoplasty were retrieved from Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Studies were included on the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with kyphoplasty involving more than 15 patients and with a follow-up of at least 6 months. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa quality assessment scale.
Results: 
12 studies met the inclusion criteria. No randomised controlled trials were retrieved. Severe complications such as pulmonary embolism, spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, and epidural haematoma occurred in 13 of the 737 patients. Leakage of cement occurred in 133 out of 1205 treated vertebrae. In 2 studies in which the functional outcome was evaluated, there was a significant improvement in comparison with the control group after six months.
Conclusion: 
Kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has a low complication risk. However, the quality of the retrieved studies was not sufficient to answer the question whether kyphoplasty leads to improved function of the patient.},

Demographic data such as age, body mass index, fracture age, hospital stay, lumbar spine bone mineral density, and amount of bone cement injected per vertebrae were recorded. Patients were analyzed clinically by ambulatory status and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Lateral radiographs were used to measure changes in anterior vertebral height. Mean anterior vertebral height increased from 58.9%+/-12.50% pre-kyphoplasty to 79.8%+/-7.12% post-kyphoplasty (P<.001).Two groups were defined based on the percentage of height restoration achieved: group A (18 patients) with a height restoration of at least 20%, and group B (27 patients) with a height restoration of 0% to 19.99% post-kyphoplasty. Mean anterior vertebral height restored in groups A and B was 28.2%+/-7.2% and 12.1%+/-6.2%, respectively (P<.05). Four patients in group A and none in group B had height loss at the treated vertebral level (P<.05). Both VAS and ambulatory status were improved after treatment (P<.05) with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Kyphoplasty can restore the collapsed vertebral height, but patients with greater height restoration were more vulnerable to a loss of corrected height.},

  abstract={Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a menace to the elderly generation causing diminished quality of life due to pain and deformity. At first, conservative treatment still is the method of choice. In case of resulting deformity, sintering and persistent pain vertebral cement augmentation techniques today are widely used. Open correction of resulting deformity by different types of osteotomies addresses sagittal balance, but has comparably high morbidity. Besides conventional vertebral cement augmentation techniques balloon kyphoplasty has become a popular tool to address painful thoracic and lumbar compression fractures. It showed improved pain reduction and lower complication rates compared to standard vertebroplasty. Interestingly the results of two placebo-controlled vertebroplasty studies question the value of cement augmentation, if compared to a sham operation. Even though there exists now favourable data for kyphoplasty from one randomised controlled trial, the absence of a sham group leaves the placebo effect unaddressed. Technically kyphoplasty can be performed with a transpedicular or extrapedicular access. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-cement should be favoured, since calcium phosphate cement showed inferior biomechanical properties and less effect on pain reduction especially in less stable burst fractures. Common complications of kyphoplasty are cement leakage and adjacent segment fractures. Rare complications are toxic PMMA-monomer reactions, cement embolisation, and infection.},

Various vertebral augmentation options including kyphoplasty aim at preventing the sequelae of pain and immobility that can develop as the result of the vertebral fractures. The mechanism for pain relief following kyphoplasty is not entirely understood, and the restoration of a portion of the lost vertebral height is a subject of debate. We retrospectively reviewed radiographic imaging, pain relief, analgesic intake and functional outcomes in 67 consecutive patients who underwent single- or multilevel kyphoplasty with the primary goal of quantifying the restoration of lost vertebral height. We observed a mean of 45% of the lost vertebral height restored postprocedurally. Secondarily, kyphoplasty was associated with significant decreases in pain scores, daily morphine consumption and improvement in patient-reported functional measures.},

  abstract={Aim: 
The aim of this article was to study the results of two different types of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) and kyphoplasty (KPs) to osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVF).
Methods: 
It was prospectively analyzed a series of 47 PVs from January 2003 to February 2008, and a consecutive series 30 KPs from March 2008 to January 2010, performed for patients with painful OVFs. Twenty-five PVs were performed using the frontal-opening cannula (FOC) and 22 using the new side-opening cannula (SOC), randomly distributed in the PV group.
Results: 
The incidence of cement extrusion was 16.7% with KP, comparing with PV, it was 27.3% using the SOC (P<0.05) and 68,0% with the FOC (P<0.05), but comparing SOC with FOC, the cement extrusion was significantly lower using the SOC (P<0.05), all asymptomatic. The pain control was similar for all groups (P<0.05), with good improvement of pain in most of the patients, and there were no clinical relevant complications.
Conclusion: 
The cement leakage was significantly reduced with the KP (16.7%) and the SOC (27.3%) for PV, in comparison with the FOC (68.0%). The cement extrusion was slightly lower with KP, but not a significant difference, comparing with SOC, increasing the safety of the procedure using both the KP and this new SOC.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective comparative analysis.
Objective: 
We analyzed kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and bone cement leakage in patients treated by vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) to compare the effectiveness of VP and KP for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Superior results have been reported for the use of KP for kyphotic deformity correction and collapsed vertebral height restoration. However, there are no previous comparative reports comparing the efficacy of KP versus VP according to the shapes of fractured vertebrae.
Methods: 
A total of 103 patients underwent either VP (n=58) or KP (n=45) for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture between October 2006 and September 2009. We organized the patients into 6 groups according to treatment method and fracture type: VP (wedge-shaped), VP (V-shaped), VP (flat-shaped), KP (wedge-shaped), KP (V-shaped), and KP (flat-shaped). Comparisons were performed for kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and cement leakage between VP and KP groups.
Results: 
KP was more effective than VP, especially for middle column height restoration and bone cement leakage prevention, for all fracture types (P value <0.05). In addition, KP was more effective in anterior height restoration and kyphosis correction in both flat and wedge-shape fractures (P value <0.05). However, posterior column vertebral height was not restored in either the KP group or the VP group. The clinical outcomes did not differ between the 2 groups (P value >0.05).
Conclusions: 
KP has a significant advantage over VP in terms of kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and cement leakage prevention. KP has an obvious advantage in terms of middle vertebral height restoration and cement leakage prevention, especially for V-shape compression fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Consequences of vertebral osteoporotic fractures include pain and progressive vertebral collapse resulting in spinal kyphosis, decreased quality of life, disability and mortality. Minimally invasive procedures represent an advance to the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs. Despite encouraging results reported by many authors, surgical intervention in an osteoporotic spine is fraught with difficulties. Advanced patients age and comorbidities are of great concern.
Patients and methods: 
We designed a retrospective case-control study on 110 post-menopausal women consecutively visited at our institution. Study population was split in a surgical and a conservative cohort, according to the provided treatment.
Results: 
Kyphoplasty treated patients had lower back pain VAS scores at 1 month as compared with conservatively treated patients (p < 0.05). EQ5D validated questionnaire also showed a better quality of life at 1 month for surgically treated patients (p < 0.05). SF-12 scores showed greater improvements at 1 month and 3 months with statistically significant difference between the two groups just at 3 months (p < 0.05). At 12 months, scores from all scales were not statistically different between the two cohorts, although surgically treated patients showed better trends than conservatively treated patients in pain and quality of life. Kyphoplasty was able to restore more than 54.55% of the original segmental kyphosis, whereas patients in conservative cohort lost 6.67% of the original segmental kyphosis on average.
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty is a modern minimal invasive surgery, allowing faster recovery than bracing treatment. It can avoid the deformity in kyphosis due to VCF. In fact, the risk to develop a new vertebral fracture after the first one is very high.},

Intravertebral clefts were identified on conventional radiographs, MR or CT images as gas- or fluid-filled spaces adjacent to an endplate of a fractured vertebra. Forty-four vertebrae showed intravertebral clefts. All clefts were filled with PMMA showing a typical filling pattern. Due to the prone positioning of the patient during vertebroplasty, a significant reduction of the kyphosis angle was achieved in the cleft group. Cement leakage occurred in 18.2% of clefts and 46% of regular osteoporotic fractures. In all patients, good filling of the cleft was achieved no matter where the needle tip was placed in the vertebra. The VAS score was 9.1 preoperatively, 3.6 before discharge and 3.9 6 months postoperatively, showing no significant difference between both groups. Patients with intravertebral clefts show a significant reduction of the kyphosis angle compared to non-cleft patients and have a significantly lower risk of experiencing cement leakage during vertebroplasty. Pain reduction is the same in both groups.},

  abstract={Background: 
The presence of a L5 transverse process fracture is reported in many texts to be a marker of pelvis fracture instability. There is paucity of literature to support this view. Only two previous studies have been performed on this subject with statistical analysis.
Methods: 
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional review of all abdominopelvic CT scans performed for blunt abdominal trauma in a Level 1 Trauma Unit between January 2012 and August 2013. A total of 203 patients met our inclusion criteria. Fifty four (54) of these patients had an associated pelvis fracture.
Results: 
Of the 54 patients with pelvis fractures 26 (48%) had an unstable fracture (AO Type B and C) and 28 (52%) had a stable pelvis fracture (AO Type A). Five (19%) of the 26 patients with an unstable pelvis fracture had an associated L5 transverse process fracture. This association was not statistically significant (P=0.724). Seven (12%) of the 28 patients with a stable fracture pattern had an associated L5 transverse process fracture. Three patients (2%) had an L5 transverse fracture in the absence of a demonstrable pelvis fracture. The relative risk of an unstable pelvis fracture in the presence of a L5 transverse process fracture is 1.2 (CI 0.6 2.3).
Conclusions: 
The presence of an L5 transverse process fracture on an abdominopelvic CT scan is strongly associated with an underlying pelvis fracture (P<0.001). Statistically, its presence however does not strongly predict instability (P=0.724). The latter finding differs from the previously published studies.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
This study aimed at assessing the cement leakage rate and the filling pattern in patients treated with vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and stentoplasty with and without a newly developed lavage technique.
Study design: 
Retrospective clinical case-control study.
Methods: 
A newly developed bipedicular lavage technique prior to cement application was applied in 64 patients (45.1 %) with 116 vertebrae, ("lavage" group). A conventional bipedicular cement injection technique was used in 78 patients (54.9 %) with 99 levels ("controls"). The outcome measures were filling patterns and leakage rates.
Results: 
The overall leakage rate (venous, cortical defect, intradiscal) was 37.9 % in the lavage and 83.8 % in the control group (p < 0.001). Venous leakage (lavage 12.9 % vs. controls 31.3 %; p = 0.001) and cortical defect leakage (lavage 17.2 % vs. controls 63.3 %; p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the lavage group compared to "controls," whereas intradiscal leakages were similar in both groups (lavage 12.1 % vs. controls 15.2 %; p = 0.51). For venous leakage multivariate logistic regression analysis showed lavage to be the only independent predictor. Lavage was associated with 0.33-times (95 % CI 0.16-0.65; p = 0.001) lower likelihood for leakage in compared to controls.
Conclusions: 
Vertebral body lavage prior to cement augmentation is a safe technique to reduce cement leakage in a clinical setting and has the potential to prevent pulmonary fat embolism. Moreover, a better filling pattern can be achieved.},

  abstract={Summary: 
The life expectancy of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) patients was evaluated as a function of their treatment. Compared to non-operated patients, the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patient cohort had 115% and 44% greater adjusted life expectancy, respectively. Kyphoplasty patients had a 34% greater adjusted life expectancy than vertebroplasty patients.
Introduction: 
Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of painful VCFs. This comparative effectiveness study characterized the life expectancy of VCF patients as a function of their treatment.
Methods: 
Life expectancy of VCF patients in the 100% U.S. Medicare dataset (2005-2008) was estimated using a parametric Weibull survival model (adjusted for comorbidities), and compared between operated and non-operated patients as well as between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patients. A total of 858,978 patients with a newly diagnosed VCF were identified, including 119,253 kyphoplasty patients (13.9%) and 63,693 vertebroplasty patients (7.4%).
Results: 
Adjusted life expectancy was 85% greater for operated than non-operated patients (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 82-89%). Compared to non-operated patients, the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patient cohort had 115% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 111-119%) and 44% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 42-47%) greater adjusted life expectancy, respectively. Kyphoplasty patients had a 34% greater adjusted life expectancy than vertebroplasty patients (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 31-36%). Across all gender-age groups, the median life expectancy predicted by the parametric Weibull model was 2.2-7.3 years greater for operated than non-operated patients.
Conclusions: 
Statistically significant and substantial differences in life expectancy were observed between the treated and non-treated cohorts in the Medicare population. Among the treated cohorts, patients in the vertebroplasty group experienced less of a survival benefit than those who received kyphoplasty. The results will be a useful basis for future cost effectiveness studies of VCF treatments for the Medicare population.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective study.
Introduction: 
Local infiltration analgesia is effective in many surgeries as knee arthroplasty, but the analgesic efficacy of local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine in trauma spine surgery in T10 to L2 has not been clarified. We conducted a trial to assess the analgesic efficacy of intraoperative local infiltration analgesia (LIA) with ropivacaine.
Objective: 
The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of intraoperative local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine on postoperative pain for patients undergoing thoracolumbar junction fracture surgery.
Methods: 
In a retrospective study, in 76 patients undergoing spine surgery for thoracolumbar junction fracture, 20ml of ropivacaine 7.5% (n R group=38) was infiltrated using a systematic technique, or no infiltration was realized (n M group=38). We assessed postoperative pain with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and morphine consumption in the 24 first hours.
Results: 
VAS pain score upon awakening and at 2hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the ropivacaine group (P=0.01 and P=0.002). Rescue opioid requirement during the 24 first hours were about 50% lower in the ropivacaine group (P=0.01). No local or systemic side effects were observed.
Conclusion: 
Intraoperative LIA with ropivacaine in thoracolumbar junction fracture surgery may have an analgesic effect in postoperative pain control (24hours) with a reduction of VAS and morphine consumption.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have recently been used to treat painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Early clinical results have been encouraging, but very little is known about the consequences of augmentation with cement for adjacent, unaugmented levels.
Objective: 
This study performed a systemic review of the studies concerning whether the incidence of subsequent vertebral body fracture after vertebral augmentation therapy would be increased long-term.
Study design: 
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing the long-term incidence of subsequent vertebral body fracture between vertebral augmentation surgeries like vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty and conventional nonsurgical management.
Setting: 
The MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in annual proceedings were systematically searched for evidence.
Methods: 
Relevant reports were reviewed by 2 reviewers independently and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using guidelines set by QUOROM statement criteria.
Results: 
Pooled results from 2 randomized controlled trials showed no significant increase of the secondary fracture rate after vertebral augmentation therapy compared with that of conventional treatment (P = 0.07). Few large-sample randomized controlled trials were specifically performed to investigate new fractures as an outcome of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.
Limitations: 
There were few data sources from which to extract abstracted data or published studies. There were only 2 randomized controlled trials that met criteria.
Conclusions: 
Although vertebral augmentation therapies, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been widely used in clinics to treat patients' back pain caused by vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis, no evidence shows that they can increase the fracture of adjacent vertebral bodies.},

  abstract={As a treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), vertebral perforation does not require bone cement infusion. Here, we retrospectively assessed the long-term therapeutic effects of vertebroplasty in a comparison with those of vertebral perforation. The subjects were 64 patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP group) and 67 patients who underwent vertebral perforation (Perforation group) between 2006 and 2011 at Takeda general hospital. We compared the analgesic effects of the treatments and the incidences of new VCFs between the groups at 15 months postsurgery. The pain scores on a visual analog scale 15 months postsurgery were 2.3 ± 2.0 in the PVP group and 2.1 ± 1.4 in the Perforation group, a nonsignificant difference (p = .90). The presence of vertebral mobility did not influence the analgesic effect in either group. New VCFs developed at a significantly higher rate in the PVP group (n = 27, 52%) compared to the Perforation group (n = 11, 24%; p = .0017). This difference was even greater within 3 months of the surgery, in 19 PVP patients (38%) and two Perforation patients (3.0%; p < .0001). However, the incidence after 3 months was eight PVP patients and nine Perforation patients, a nonsignificant difference (p = .50). The Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the new fractures after surgery in both treatment groups may occur at the same frequency at around 31 months postoperatively. Vertebroplasty is more effective than vertebral perforation in relieving pain early in the course of treatment, but over the long term, no significant difference in pain was seen between the two treatments. The complication of new fractures seen with cement vertebroplasty is only seen after the procedure.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty are effective treatment options for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures but are limited in correction of kyphotic deformity. Lordoplasty has been reported as an alternative, cost-effective, minimally invasive, percutaneous cement augmentation technique with good restoration of vertebral body height and alignment. The authors report on its clinical and radiological midterm results. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients treated with lordoplasty from 2002 to 2014. Inclusion criteria were clinical and radiological follow-up evaluations longer than 24 months. Radiographs were accessed regarding initial correction and progressive loss of reduction. Complications and reoperations were recorded. Actual pain level, pain relief immediately after surgery, autonomy, and subjective impression of improvement of posture were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS Sixty-five patients (46 women, 19 men, age range 38.9-86.2 years old) were treated with lordoplasty for 69 vertebral compression and insufficiency fractures. A significant correction of the vertebral kyphotic angle (mean 13°) and segmental kyphotic angle (mean 11°) over a mean follow-up of 33 months (range 24-108 months) was achieved (p < 0.001). On average, pain was relieved to 90% of the initial pain level. In 24% of the 65 patients a second spinal intervention was necessary: 16 distant (24.6%) and 7 adjacent (10.8%) new osteoporotic fractures, 4 instrumented stabilizations (6.2%), 1 new adjacent traumatic fracture (1.5%), and 1 distant microsurgical decompression (1.5%). Cement leakage occurred in 10.4% but was only symptomatic in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS Lordoplasty appeared safe and effective in midterm pain alleviation and restoration of kyphotic deformity in osteoporotic compression and insufficiency fractures. The outcomes of lordoplasty are consistent with other augmentation techniques.},

  abstract={Background: 
Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are currently used as a standard for anti-thrombotic therapy. Skin necrosis caused by LMWH is a rare and probably under-reported complication. The aim of our systematic review is to analyse the present literature for cases of LMWH-induced skin necrosis, emphasising the pathogenesis, clinical pattern, and management of this rare side effect.
Methods: 
We performed a Medline literature search (PubMed database) and manual cross-referencing to identify all articles related to LMWH-induced skin necrosis. Data were analysed for type of LMWH used, time until skin necrosis occurred, localisation, size, laboratory findings, switch anticoagulant, complications, and outcome. Additionally, the case of a patient from our hospital is presented.
Results: 
We included a total of 20 articles (21 cases) reporting on LMWH-induced skin necrosis. Skin necrosis occurred locally and distant from the injection site. Heparin-induced antibodies were frequently observed (positive 9/11 articles, negative 2/11). However, severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000 cells/ml) occurred in only four cases, while platelet count remained normal in 50% of the cases. After patients had been switched to other anti-thrombotic drugs, the clinical course was usually benign; however, reconstructive surgery was necessary in two cases.
Conclusion: 
LMWH-induced skin necrosis may occur as part of the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) syndrome, but other pathomechanisms, including allergic reactions and local trauma, may also be involved. When HIT is excluded, unfractionated heparin is a safe switch anticoagulant. Otherwise, non-heparin preparations such as hirudin or fondaparinux should be preferred.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral fractures and severe injuries to the spine cord in children are rare and account for a small proportion of all childhood injuries. Pediatric vertebral and spinal cord injuries have unique characteristics depending on their age. Young children sustain upper cervical spine injuries, which are more serious injuries and have a higher mortality rate. Older children have lower spine injuries and thoracoabdominal injuries.
Objectives: 
This study aimed to present the epidemiology and potential complications from lumbar spine fractures.
Cases: 
There were 4 cases of older children who sustained lumbar vertebral fractures.
Conclusions: 
Fractures of the lumbar spine in children, although relatively rare, are important to understand. Patterns of injury with vertebral and spinal cord injuries in children vary from those of adults. The biologic differences of children make differences in fracture patterns and alter the management necessary for successful treatment. Errors in management can have adverse effects on these injuries.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
We sought to determine whether percutaneous vertebroplasty--which involves the injection of cement to stabilize a fractured vertebral body--may be an effective treatment for vertebral fracture.
Methods: 
We enrolled 79 consecutive osteoporotic patients (24 men and 55 women; ages 51 to 93 years) presenting with acute vertebral fractures. Clinical characteristics and bone densitometry were measured at baseline. Pain scores (on a 0 to 25 scale) and levels of function (on a 0 to 20 scale) were recorded on presentation, at 24 hours, at 6 weeks, and 6 to 12 months after therapy.
Results: 
Fifty-five patients (70%) were treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty and 24 (30%) were treated by conservative therapy alone. They were followed for a mean of 215 days (range, 57 to 399 days). The baseline clinical characteristics, bone densitometry, and fracture data were similar in the two groups. Twenty-four hours after vertebroplasty, there was a 53% reduction in pain scores (from 19 to 9; P = 0.0001) and a 29% improvement in physical functioning (from 14 to 18; P = 0.0001), whereas pain scores and physical functioning remained unchanged at 24 hours in the patients treated conservatively (both P = 0.0001 compared with the changes after percutaneous vertebroplasty). Thirteen patients (24%) treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty were able to cease all analgesia after 24 hours (P = 0.0001 compared with none of the 24 patients treated conservatively). Clinical outcomes at 6 weeks and 6 to 12 months were similar in both groups.
Conclusion: 
When compared with conservative therapy, percutaneous vertebroplasty results in prompt pain relief and rapid rehabilitation. In experienced hands, it is a safe and effective procedure for treating acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.},

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can lead to an increased risk of cervical fractures.
Sources of data: 
A systematic review was undertaken using the keywords 'ankylosing spondylitis', 'spine fractures', 'cervical fractures', 'surgery' and 'postoperative outcomes' on Medline, Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ovid and Embase, and the quality of the studies included was evaluated according to the Coleman Methodology Score.
Areas of agreement: 
Surgery ameliorates neurological function in patients with unstable AS-related cervical fractures. The combined anterior/posterior and the posterior approaches are more effective than the anterior approach.
Areas of controversy: 
The optimal approach, anterior, posterior or combined anterior/posterior, for the management of AS related cervical fractures has not been defined.
Growing points: 
Open reduction and internal fixation allows avoiding worsening and enhances neurological function in AS patients with cervical fractures.
Areas timely for developing research: 
Adequately powered randomized trials with appropriate subjective and objective outcome measures are necessary to reach definitive conclusions.},

  abstract={Odontoid fractures are frequent in patients over 70 years of age, and in patients over 80 years of age they form the majority of spinal fractures. In a retrospective analysis of 23 geriatric (> 70 years) patients with a fracture of the odontoid, we compared some of the clinical features to a contemporary series of patients younger than 70 years of age. Whereas in the younger patients high-energy trauma accounted for the majority of the fractures, low-energy falls were the underlying cause in 90% of the odontoid fractures in the elderly. In contrast to the younger age group, in elderly patients predominantly type II fractures (95%) were identified. Anterior and posterior displacement were recorded with equal frequency on the first postinjury radiograph in the younger age group, whereas in geriatric patients displacement was mainly posterior. The number of associated injuries was significantly higher in younger patients. There was no difference in the occurrence of neurological deficits (13%) between the two age groups, and neurological compromise was mainly related to posterior dislocation of the odontoid in both groups. The overall complication rate was significantly higher in elderly patients (52.2% vs 32.7%), with an associated in-hospital mortality of 34.8%. Loss of reduction and non-union after non-operative treatment, a complicated postoperative course and complications due to associated injuries accounted primarily for this high complication rate. Elderly patients with a fracture of the odontoid are a high-risk group with a high morbidity and mortality rate. An aggressive diagnostic approach to detect unstable fractures and application of a halo device or early primary internal stabilisation of these fractures is recommended.},

The results show that there is no clear diagnostic or treatment standard for PCE. The literature research revealed that the risk of a pulmonary embolism ranges from 3.5 to 23% for osteoporotic fractures. In cases of asymptomatic patients with peripheral PCE we recommend no treatment besides clinical follow-up; in cases of symptomatic or central embolisms, however, we recommend to proceed according to the guidelines regarding the treatment of thrombotic pulmonary embolisms, which includes initial heparinization and a following 6-month coumarin therapy. In order to avoid any types of embolisms, both procedures should only be performed by experienced surgeons after critical determination of the indications.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A case-control study of patients with isolated type II dens fractures treated with halo vest immobilization.
Objectives: 
To evaluate age as a risk factor for failure of halo immobilization in patients with type II dens fractures.
Summary of background data: 
The literature reports an average fusion rate of approximately 70% in patients with type II dens fractures treated by halo vest immobilization. Although many investigators have examined patient age as a risk factor for nonfusion using halo immobilization, all studies have been supported only by Class III data. These studies, consequently, carry little or no statistical significance. Therefore, a case-control study based on Class II data was designed to evaluate age as a risk factor for failure of halo vest immobilization in patients with type II dens fractures.
Methods: 
Thirty-three patients with isolated type II dens fractures treated with halo vest immobilization at the University of Iowa Hospitals and clinics between 1983 and 1997 were included. Type II fractures were defined with plain radiography as per the Anderson-D'Alonzo classification. Cases were defined as nonfusions after halo immobilization, whereas control subjects represented successful bony unions attained with halo immobilization.
Results: 
When the case and control groups were compared, there was no significant difference between the groups in the presence of concomitant medical conditions, sex, the amount of fracture displacement, the direction of fracture displacement, the length of hospital stay, or length of follow-up. Age more than 50 years was found to be a highly significant risk factor for failure of halo immobilization (P = 0.002; Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). The odds ratio of these data indicate that the risk of failure of halo immobilization is 21 times higher in patients aged 50 years or more.
Conclusions: 
Surgical intervention should be considered in those patients aged 50 years or more who have a type II dens fracture, if it can be accomplished with acceptable risk of morbidity and death.},

Material and methods: 
We have divided 11 patients in two groups as classical and Ozer's technique. We have also compared (radiologically and clinically) the classical anterior transodontoid screw fixation (group II: 6 cases) and Ozer's transodontoid screw fixation technique (group I: 5 cases) retrospectively.
Results: 
There was no difference regaring the clinical features of the groups. However, the radiological results showed 100% fusion for Ozer's screw fixation technique and 83% fusion for the classical screw fixation technique.
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, we suggest that Ozer's technique may help to increase the fusion capacity for osteoporotic type II odontoid fractures.},

Papers including information about type of fracture, treatment carried out, complication rates, mortality and morbidities were eligible to be included in this study. Fourteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Six reported on all types of injuries of the upper cervical spine, and eight only odontoid fractures (C2). Overall mortality rate ranged between 0 to 31.4%. Overall morbidity rate was from 10.3 to 90.9%. No significant difference was identified between three types of treatment (rigid collar cuff without fracture reduction, halo cast with reduction of fracture displacement, and surgical treatment). Halo-cast got the highest rate of complications. Surgical treatment got a mortality rate from 0 to 40.0%, and a morbidity rate from 10.3 to 62.5%. Non-union rate ranged between 8.9 to 62.5%. Elderly patients with upper cervical spine fractures must be notified that these injuries are associated with high incidence of non-union, morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract={Background: 
The treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using a transpedicular approach and cement injection has grown significantly over the last two decades.
Methods: 
The aim was to study the deployment of an implant dedicated to the vertebral augmentation by percutaneous approach (kyphoplasty). Its kinematics and the related forces have been investigated. A theoretical model of deployment has been proposed and the ancillary was instrumented with strain gauges and Hall effect sensors to measure kinematics and force in the deployment actuator (tensile rod). The methodology was first evaluated ex-vivo in a test-bench with boundary conditions monitored by a tensile machine. Then, a cadaver study was carried out in three lumbar and thoracic vertebral segments of normal and osteoporotic spines.
Findings: 
The relationships between ancillary internal forces, deployment, and cranio-caudal pushing force have been obtained. The test-bench experiment showed quasi-proportional relationship between force distribution and kinematics during the deployment. Ex-vivo cranio-caudal pushing forces were measured. Cadaver studies showed cranio-caudal pushing forces comprised between 100N and 200N. These forces were dependent upon the implant location in the vertebral body and bone stock.
Interpretation: 
The methodology was related to the analysis of load distribution and kinematics of a deployable implant for vertebral augmentation. The ancillary instrumentation contributed to the objective quantification of the surgical technique. The cadaver study in normal and osteoporotic spines exhibited the role of bone properties and implant location in implant deployment. This pilot study showed a methodology to improve the kyphoplasty surgery and patient comfort in clinical routine.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the stability of lengthened sacroiliac screw and standard sacroiliac screw for the treatment of unilateral vertical sacral fractures; to provide reference for clinical applications.
Methods: 
A finite element model of Tile type C pelvic ring injury (unilateral Denis type II fracture of the sacrum) was produced. The unilateral sacral fractures were fixed with lengthened sacroiliac screw and sacroiliac screw in six different types of models respectively. The translation and angle displacement of the superior surface of the sacrum (in standing position on both feet) were measured and compared.
Results: 
The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 or S2 segment is superior to that of one sacroiliac screw fixation in the same sacral segment. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 and S2 segments respectively is superior to that of one sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 and S2 segments respectively. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 and S2 segments respectively is superior to that of one lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 or S2 segment. The stability of one sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 and S2 segments respectively is markedly superior to that of one sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 or S2 segment. The vertical and rotational stability of lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation and sacroiliac screw fixation in S2 is superior to that of S1.
Conclusion: 
In a finite element model of type C pelvic ring disruption, S1 and S2 lengthened sacroiliac screws should be utilized for the fixation as regularly as possible and the most stable fixation is the combination of the lengthened sacroiliac screws of S1 and S2 segments. Even if lengthened sacroiliac screws cannot be systematically used due to specific conditions, one sacroiliac screw fixation in S1 and S2 segments respectively is recommended. No matter which kind of sacroiliac screw is used, if only one screw can be implanted, the fixation in S2 segment is more recommended than that in S1.

  abstract={To know the efficacy of different internal fixation devices used in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, specimens of 15 adult cadaveric (T-8 to L-4) were prepared and were divided into 5 groups for comparative study. Except the control group, the vertebra of T-12 of every specimen in other 4 groups was artificially fractured, imitating flexion fracture dislocation, with standard technic. Then, they were fixed in each group, with Luque's rod, Dick's screw, pedicle screw plate or Dunn's device respectively. The stress distribution and yielding stress under load and dimensional motions in each group were recorded and compared among the groups and with the control. In the experimental groups, Dunn's device gave the strongest support, against load on the anterior and middle columns. Dick's screw and pedicle screw plate could theoretically fix the anterior, middle and posterior columns rigidly; however, because of the weakness persisted in the connection of their components, their fixation effectiveness was reduced. Luque's rod acted though effectively against bending on every direction, it could not stand much axial load. It is obvious that each of these 4 devices has its own advantages and could be used to prevent horizontal displacement of the fixed fracture, but fail to control torsional stress.},

  abstract={Osteoporosis frequently leads to vertebral compression fractures. Percutaneous cement augmentation, one recent technique, may alter the biomechanics of the vertebral body and spinal segment. These alterations reportedly predispose the spinal segment to additional vertebral compression fractures. We investigated the changes in segment stiffness and strength after polymethylmethacrylate augmentation. Twelve thoracic segments consisting of five vertebral bodies were divided into two groups, a pure moment group (Group 1) and an eccentric compression group (Group 2). Baseline measurements of stiffness were taken on each segment followed by the creation of an initial vertebral compression fracture during which stiffness and strength were measured. After augmentation, stiffness was again measured. Finally, a second vertebral compression fracture was created measuring stiffness and strength again. Augmentation did not alter stiffness before and after augmentation in either group. Augmentation also did not result in any difference in strength measured at subsequent fracture when compared with strength measured at initial fracture in either group. The augmentation of vertebral compression fractures by kyphoplasty does not alter the stiffness or the strength of the multilevel segments and eccentric compression in contrast to pure moments leads to a lower strength during mechanical testing.},

This review offers a critical examination of the biomechanical model that posits the posterior elements as a substantial contributor to pain in vertebral fracture. Further, the review assesses the treatment of posterior-element-associated pain in the setting of vertebral compression fracture in relation to vertebral augmentation.
Recent findings: 
In 2015, the only prospective randomized trial comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty with facet blockade was published in which authors found that percutaneous vertebroplasty produced better pain relief and function based on Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, and visual analog scale in the short term (≤1 week). However, differences in pain relief at 1 month and 12 months were not statistically significant.
Summary: 
The posterior elements may play a significant role in the pain generated after vertebral compression fractures. Treatment of the posterior element pain through medial branch radiofrequency ablation or facet injections may be another tool in providing analgesia in those with pain after vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Vertebral fractures have a substantial impact on the health and quality of life of elderly individuals as one of the most common complications of osteoporosis. Vertebral augmentation procedures including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been supported as means of reducing pain and mitigating disability associated with these fractures. However, use of vertebroplasty is debated, with negative randomized controlled trials published in 2009 and divergent clinical guidelines. The effect of changing evidence and guidelines on different practitioners' utilization of both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the years after these developments and publication of data supporting their use is poorly understood.
Methods: 
Using national aggregate Medicare claims data from 2002 through 2014, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures were identified by provider type. Changes in utilization by procedure type and provider were studied.
Results: 
Total vertebroplasty billing increased 101.6% from 2001 (18,911) through 2008 (38,123). Total kyphoplasty billing frequency increased 17.2% from 2006 (54,329) through 2008 (63,684). Vertebroplasty billing decreased 60.9% from 2008 through 2014 to its lowest value (14,898). Kyphoplasty billing decreased 8.4% from 2008 (63,684) through 2010 (58,346), but then increased 7.6% from 2010 to 2013 (62,804).
Conclusions: 
Vertebroplasty billing decreased substantially beginning in 2009 and continued to decrease through 2014 despite publication of more favorable studies in 2010 to 2012, suggesting studies published in 2009 and AAOS guidelines in 2010 may have had a persistent negative effect. Kyphoplasty did not decrease as substantially and increased in more recent years, suggesting a clinical practice response to favorable studies published during this period.},

Our research questions for the meta-analysis were: Is there a clinical and statistical difference in pain relief, functional improvement, and quality of life between conservative care and cement augmentation for VCF and, if so, are they maintained at longer time points? We conducted a search of MEDLINE from January 1980 to July 2011 using PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Searches were performed from medical subject headings. Terms "vertebroplasty" and "compression fracture" were used. The outcome variables of pain, functional measures, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and new fracture risk were analyzed. A random effects model was chosen. Continuous variables were calculated using the standardized mean difference comparing improvement from baseline of the experimental group with the control group. New vertebral fracture risk was calculated using log odds ratio. Six studies met the criteria. The pain visual analog scale (VAS) mean difference was 0.73 (confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.10) for early (<12 weeks) and 0.58 (CI 0.19, 0.97) for late time points (6 to 12 months), favoring vertebroplasty (p < 0.001). The functional outcomes at early and late time points were statistically significant with 1.08 (CI 0.33, 1.82) and 1.16 (CI 0.14, 2.18), respectively. The HRQOL showed superior results of vertebroplasty compared with conservative care at early and late time points of 0.39 (CI 0.16, 0.62) and 0.33 (CI 0.16, 0.51), respectively. Secondary fractures were not statistically different between the groups, 0.065 (CI -0.57, 0.70). This meta-analysis showed greater pain relief, functional recovery, and health-related quality of life with cement augmentation compared with controls. Cement augmentation results were significant in the early (<12 weeks) and the late time points (6 to 12 months). This meta-analysis provides strong evidence in favor of cement augmentation in the treatment of symptomatic VCF fractures.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective chart review of one surgeon's practice.
Objective: 
We evaluate the perioperative morbidity of 43 patients undergoing minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion to differentiate risks between primary and revision surgery candidates.
Summary of background data: 
Minimally invasive approaches to the lumbar spine have rapidly evolved and the technical feasibility and safety of minimally invasive interbody fusion is well established. Revision surgery is technically more challenging and may cause avoidance of such approaches because of altered anatomy and absent bony landmarks. Description of minimally invasive surgery approaches among revision patients and the feasibility of such techniques demands clarification.
Methods: 
Forty-three consecutive minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions (TLIFs) and posterior lumbar interbody fusions (PLIFs) were reviewed. Estimated blood loss, operative time, and complication rates were compared between primary and revision patients using Student t tests.
Results: 
Seventeen revision surgery cases (40%) were compared with 26 primary surgeries (60%) to elucidate differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, and complications. Demographic variables were similar in both groups. Estimated blood loss trended higher among the PLIF group and among revision cases, though no statistical significance was observed. A higher rate of complications, most notably incidental durotomy, was observed among revision cases in both PLIF and TLIF patients. One patient undergoing primary surgery had an intraoperative pedicle fracture, and 1 patient undergoing revision surgery had an asymptomatic screw malposition. No patients had a major complication, nerve injury, infection, or conversion to an open procedure.
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion by revision surgery is technically feasible and is not associated with more blood loss or neurologic morbidity. However, revision surgery has a higher minor perioperative complication rate, particularly of incidental durotomy. These outcomes demand significant experience before attempting minimally invasive revision surgery in the lumbar spine.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective comparative cohort series.
Objective: 
To evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques incorporating with intraoperative 3-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation (ITFN) for treating Hangman fracture.
Summary of background data: 
MIS screw fixation for Hangman fracture can decrease iatrogenic soft-tissue injury, but increase the risk of instrumentation-related complications due to lack of anatomical landmarks. With the advantages of obtaining intraoperative real-time images, automatic registration, and 3-dimensional views, the ITFN system seems to be an inherent partner for MIS.
Methods: 
20 patients with Hangman fracture underwent C2-C3 pedicle screw fixation using ITFN. 6 patients used MIS technique, with the other 14 patients using conventional open technique. Operative time and blood loss were recorded. The accuracy of screw positions was studied by postoperative CT scan. Neck pain visual analogue score (VAS) was evaluated and the fusion status was ascertained in 6-month follow-up.
Results: 
The average operative time was 134.2 ± 8.0 minutes in computer-assisted orthopaedics surgery (CAOS)-MIS group and 139.3 ± 25.8 minutes in CAOS-open group (P > 0.01). The blood loss was 66.7 ± 25.8 mL in CAOS-MIS group and 250.0 ± 141.4 mL in CAOS-open group (P < 0.01). A total of 80 screws were inserted. No screw-related neurovascular injury was observed. 83.3% (20/24) screws in CAOS-MIS group and 89.3% (50/56) screws in CAOS-open group were grade 1 screw (P > 0.01). No grade 3 screw was detected in both groups. Compared with the CAOS-open group (1.7 ± 0.6), neck pain VAS in 6-month follow-up in CAOS-MIS group (0.3 ± 0.5) was significantly lower (P < 0.01). Solid fusion was demonstrated in all the cases.
Conclusion: 
The integration of these 2 techniques MIS and ITFN, we call "computer assisted minimally invasive spinal surgery," is proved to be feasible and safe for treating Hangman fracture with the advantage of significantly reduced iatrogenic soft tissue injury. So we think CAMISS technique represents the most recent modification of spine surgery.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease. Due to an increase of the older population an higher impact of osteoporosis and its treatment can be expected.
Background: 
Painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures result in an increased morbidity and mortality. Standard treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures comprises analgetics, bed rest and, if needed, orthotics.
Method: 
By mere augmentation of the vertebra with polymethylmet acrylate (PMMA), the so called "vertebroplasty" a good pain reduction and increase in function and quality of life can be achieved. With the technique of kyphoplasty (Kyphon) it is feasible to correct a kyphotic deformity. Inflatable balloons are introduced to the vertebra to lift the endplates. The created cavity is filled with bone cement (PMMA).
Discussion: 
Kyphoplasty is able to correct osteoporosis induced kyphotic deformity. Compared to the technique of vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty is less risky but is more time consuming and more expensive. Time will show whether the expected advantage of deformity correction will result in a better outcome for the patient, e. g. in a lower incidence of refractures.},

A literature review of experiences with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for treating symptomatic, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).
Objectives: 
To summarize the advantages and disadvantages of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Osteoporotic VCFs are a leading cause of disability and morbidity in the elderly. The consequences of osteoporotic VCFs (pain and often progressive vertebral collapse with resultant spinal kyphosis) adversely affect quality of life, physical function, mental health, and survival. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures for treating painful fractures. Vertebroplasty entails the percutaneous injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebra in attempts to stabilize the fracture and reduce pain. Kyphoplasty addresses pain and kyphotic deformity by the percutaneous expansion of an inflatable bone tamp to effect fracture reduction before cement deposition in a fractured vertebra.
Methods: 
A literature review of surgical techniques, indications, clinical results, and complications for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Results: 
Studies of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have reported excellent pain relief and improved function in most patients with osteoporotic VCFs. Vertebroplasty has the advantage of being relatively quick and inexpensive. Kyphoplasty, while associated with increased cost and surgical time, offers the potential to improve spinal alignment. In addition, by creating an intravertebral cavity, kyphoplasty reduces the risk of extravertebral bone filler extravasation.
Conclusions: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic VCFs with successful short-term results. Prospective, randomized studies comparing these procedures to one another and comparing their long-term outcomes to conventional medical management are required to define precise roles of these exciting treatments in the spine physician's armamentarium.},

Systematic analysis.
Objective: 
To determine the morbidity and mortality of surgical treatment of odontoid fractures in the elderly.
Summary of background data: 
The prevalence of trauma in the elderly is increasing. There exists no consensus regarding the role of surgical treatment for odontoid fractures in the elderly and there exists significant variability in clinical practice. This variability may be related to a lack of robust information available to clinicians. Importantly, studies that define surgical risk are not available.
Methods: 
A systematic analysis of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published between January 1990 and June 2009. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify articles examining complications and mortality following odontoid fracture surgery in subjects 65 years of age or older. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
The initial literature search yielded 247 articles related to morbidity or mortality following surgery treatment of odontoid fractures in the elderly. After exclusion of articles based on title or abstract information, 48 remained to undergo full text review. Subsequent exclusions yielded 14 articles suited for this analysis. The most commonly reported major complications after odontoid fracture surgery in the elderly include cardiac failure (6.8%), DVT (3.2%), stroke (3.2%), pneumonia (9.9%), respiratory failure (7.7%), liver failure (6.7%), and severe infection (3.2%). Other site specific and minor complications were found to be reported consistently in the literature. The overall mortality rate after surgery is 10.1% (in-hospital, 6.2%; postdischarge, 8.8%). Similar mortality rates were found following anterior surgery (7% in-hospital; 9% overall) and posterior surgery (8% in-hospital; 9% overall); there were no differences in the rate of major airway complications between these groups (anterior: 17%; posterior: 18%). There was, however, a higher rate of site-specific complications, including nonunion, technical failure, and the need for revision surgery, following anterior surgery as compared with posterior surgery.
Conclusion: 
Based on the summary of criteria results, future research evaluating complications following surgery for odontoid fractures in elderly patients is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate currently available in the literature.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
In the first 24 h post-intervertebral disc (IVD) trauma, up to 75 % cell death has been reported. In addition, burst fractures cause post-traumatic disc degeneration by elevated pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory gene transcription. Moreover, some patients have pre-trauma degenerative disc disease. The aim of the study was to assess histological changes and cell-death over a time period of up to 1 year caused by mechanical and structural factors.
Methods: 
116 anterior portions of IVDs of the cervical spine were studied histologically by light microscopy and ultrastructurally by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The group was investigated with regard to three main parameters: fracture mechanism (compressive vs. tensile/shear loads), degeneration grade (low vs. high) and endplate fracture (with vs. without). Disc architecture (e.g. ruptures) was studied histologically. Cell morphology was examined ultrastructurally to quantify cell-death, healthy and balloon cells. According to ultrastructural observations, two time-groups (up to 6 days vs. later) were established. Statistical analyses were carried out within and between time-groups.
Results: 
Histological changes were obvious in the annulus fibrosus where ruptures with haematoma were replaced by granulation tissue. Significant differences in cell-death were seen in the first few days due to different loads. In contrast to the more degenerated segments, low degenerated ones revealed significantly less cell death with time post-trauma. Interestingly, no difference was found between groups after the sixth day. Cell-death (mean 44 % for all investigated groups) remained high after day 6 post-trauma.
Conclusion: 
IVDs retrieved from low grade degenerated segments revealed a significant recovery, with less cell-death and a partially restored disc matrix, although cell-death remained high. Long-term clinical studies of stabilized segments arising from different fracture mechanisms are required.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To study the morphological feature of complicated thoracolumbar fractures and the fixation technology of injured vertebra.
Methods: 
From January 2005 to December 2007, 61 patients with type B and C thoracolumbar fractures according to AO classification were treated. There were 53 males and 8 females, with a mean age of 33.2 years (range, 9 to 65 years). Based on ASIA grading system of neurologic deficit, Grade A was found in 41 cases, grade B in 5 cases, Grade C in 5 cases, Grade D in 6 cases and Grade E in 4 cases. The injured vertebra located at thoracic region in 13, thoracolumbar in 39 and lumbar in 9 cases. The patients were divided into two groups: 32 cases with pedicle screws in the injured vertebra and 29 cases without pedicle screw in the injured vertebra. The analyses on the morphological features of injured vertebra were performed, and comparisons were carried out on the outcome regarding the reduction and correction of the injured vertebra, and the difference of Denis scale in pain domain and work status domain, between the two groups.
Results: 
All the patients were followed up for an average of 3 years (range, 1.5 to 4.5 years). There were significance statistical difference in the correction loss of Cobb angle, sagittal index, correction of dislocation index, and the Denis pain scale between the two groups (P < 0.05). A better outcome was observed in the injured vertebra fixation group than the injured vertebra non-fixation group.
Conclusions: 
Inserting pedicle screws in the injured vertebra is effective and useful in the correction of complicated thoracolumbar fractures. It improves biomechanical stability of the spine after the operation.},

Retrospective matched cohort study.
Objective: 
To compare mortality in elderly patients with odontoid fractures after operative and nonoperative treatment. In addition, to evaluate potential factors that may increase the risk of mortality in the geriatric population after odontoid fracture.
Summary of background data: 
Odontoid fractures represent the most common cervical spine fracture in patients over 70. In this population controversy exists as to the optimal treatment of odontoid fractures, especially type II fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective review of all odontoid fractures in patients 75 years of age or older at our institution from 1996 to 2010 was performed. Comorbidities were stratified using the Charlson comorbidity index. Mortality was determined at 3 months, 1, and 5 years.
Results: 
A total of 96 patients were identified of which 75 met inclusion criteria. The average age of patients included was 82.3 years. The average Charlson comorbidity score for those operated on (2.37) was not significantly different from the nonoperative group (2.46), (P=0.45). At 3 months the operative group had a significantly lower mortality rate than the nonoperative group (P=0.024). There was no significant difference in 1-year (P=0.42) or 5-year (P=0.21) mortality between the operative and nonoperative cohorts. Of the patients treated nonoperatively, those who died within 3 months of treatment had a significantly higher Charlson score (3.98) than those who survived (2.14). Patients who survived at least 1 year after surgery had a significantly lower Charlson score (1.53) than those who died (3.22) within that time frame after surgery (P=0.05).
Conclusions: 
There was no significant difference between 1- and 5-year mortality in patients treated operatively or nonoperatively. Regardless of treatment Charlson score had a significant impact on mortality. Age significantly affected mortality in patients treated surgically.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To determine the impact of cement placement immediately adjacent to and through the endplate during percutaneous vertebroplasty on postprocedural pain and subsequent fracture rate.
Materials and methods: 
Institutional review board approval with waived consent was obtained. Medical records of 424 patients undergoing first-time, single-level vertebroplasty for osteoporotic or traumatic compression fractures were examined. Data regarding pain at rest and with activity before the procedure, along with timing and level of subsequent fractures over a 24-month period, were collected. Group 1 (n=64) included patients with no cement extension to the endplate(s), group 2 (n=216) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) but no leakage into the disk space(s), and group 3 (n=144) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) and cement leakage into the disk space(s). Analysis of variance and Fisher test were used to analyze the data, with significance set at P<.05.
Results: 
Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar among the groups. At 1 month, for groups 1, 2, and 3, the respective mean postprocedural pain numeric scores at rest were 1.4±2.7, 1.4±2.4, and 1.6±2.5 (P=.51), while the respective pain scores with activity were 4.3±2.9, 3.8±3.1, and 3.9±3.3 (P=.50). Total subsequent fractures were noted in five (8%), 26 (12%), and 15 (10%) patients in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P=.77).
Conclusion: 
Neither extension of cement to the endplate nor cement leakage into the disk space has significant impact on postprocedural pain or subsequent fracture rate at 2 years.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to clarify the weak point in immature lumbar vertebrae associated with pedicle screw instrumentation. Ten immature thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were collected from calf spines. After installation of 6- and 7-mm-diameter pedicle screws into the pedicles of each specimen, pullout force was applied to the screw using the uniaxial MTS system until failure. Tightening torque during installation was measured. From the load-displacement curve, failure load was calculated and failure site was confirmed by radiographs. Inner pedicle diameters were measured after the pullout test, and percent fills of the pedicle screw were calculated. Mean tightening torque was 1.4 or 2.1 (Nm), mean failure load was 852.5 or 1,015.0 (N), and mean percent fill was 81.4 or 93.5% for 6- or 7-mm screws, respectively. Tightening torque and percent fill in 7-mm screws were significantly (p < 0.01) greater than that in 6-mm screws; however, failure load showed no significant difference (p = 0.10) between the two screw groups. Failure by screw pullout occurred at the screw-bone interface or through the neurocentral synchondrosis (NS). NS fractures were observed in 20% of 6-mm screws, 60% of 7-mm screws, and 40% overall, whereas interface failures occurred in 80% of 6-mm screws, 40% of 7-mm screws, and 60% overall. In NS fracture group, tightening torque (p < 0.05) and percent fill (p < 0.01) were significantly greater than in the interface failure group. The results led us to conclude that the mechanism of the NS fracture is unclear. However, NS fracture could be one of the conceivable complications associated with pedicle screw fixation in the immature spine.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective review.
Objective: 
The purpose of this study is to document a series of cases of neurologic deficit following percutaneous vertebral stabilization, to identify patterns of neurologic injury, and to describe potential methods for avoiding these injuries.
Summary of background data: 
Percutaneous vertebral stabilization procedures, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have become a widely used for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, primary and metastatic vertebral tumors, and traumatic burst fractures. Despite an increasing array of indications, there have been few reports of adverse events. Neurologic complications associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been described previously as case reports and have generally been considered as infrequent and minor in severity.
Methods: 
The clinical course of 14 patients with documented loss of neurologic function following percutaneous vertebral cement augmentation was retrospectively reviewed.
Results: 
The average patient age was 74.9 years (range, 46-88 years) with 3 male and 11 female patients. Four patients underwent a vertebroplasty procedure while 10 were treated with kyphoplasty. Six patients developed neurologic deficits acutely (<24 hours of procedure). The remaining 8 patients developed neurologic symptoms at an average of 37.1 days (range, 3-112 days) postprocedure. Neurologic deficits were recorded as ASIA A in 4 patients, ASIA B in 2 patients, ASIA C in 1 patient, and ASIA D in 7 patients. Twelve of 14 patients (85.7%) required revision open surgical intervention for treatment of their neurologic injury.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been reported to be safe options for the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Although complications are infrequent, there remains the potential for catastrophic neurologic injury. Physicians performing these procedures need to be aware of these potential complications and be prepared to respond in an emergent manner (surgically) if a need arises.},

This study examined the incidence of neurologic deterioration as well as associated risk factors in our patient population. Up to 5.8% of cervical SCI patients have been noted to deteriorate neurologically after admission. Risk factors have been early surgery, halo application, traction, and Stryker frame rotation. All cervical SCI patients admitted between 1978 and 1993 who had neurologic deterioration were studied for characteristics of their event, operative status, risk factors, mortality, and neurologic return at 1 year postinjury. Patients were divided into minor and major groups based on the degree of neurologic loss. Nineteen of 1,031 patients were identified as neurologically deteriorated (1.84%). There were 8 major and 11 minor group patients. The average time from injury to deterioration was 3.95 days. Of 10 patients undergoing surgery at < or =5 days, 8 deteriorated postoperatively. Potential risk factors were ankylosing spondylitis (three patients), sepsis (four patients), and intubation (four patients). Neurologic recovery at 1 year showed that 11 of 12 patients were improved. Neurologic deterioration occurred in 1.84% of our patients. Deteriorations were associated with surgery at <5 days after injury, ankylosing spondylitis, sepsis, and intubation.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
A randomised controlled trial of vertebroplasty (VP) versus placebo assessed the effect of VP on the risk of further vertebral fractures. While no statistically significant between-group differences for new or progressed fracture risk at 12 and 24 months were observed, we observed a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Our analysis was underpowered, and further adequately powered studies are needed to be able to draw firm conclusions about further vertebral risk with vertebroplasty.
Purpose: 
This study seeks to assess the effect of VP on the risk of further radiologically apparent vertebral fracture within two years of the procedure.
Methods: 
We conducted a randomised placebo-controlled trial of VP in people with acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to VP (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). Cement volume and leakage were recorded for the VP group. Plain thoracolumbar radiographs were taken at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Two independent radiologists assessed these for new and progressed fractures at the same, adjacent and non-adjacent levels.
Results: 
At 12 and 24 months, radiographs were available for 45 (58 %) and 47 (60 %) participants, respectively. There were no between-group differences for new or progressed fractures: 32 and 40 in the VP group after 12 and 24 months compared with 21 and 33 in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 3.94). Similar results were seen when considering only adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 2.30 (0.57 to 9.29)) and non-adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 1.45 (0.55 to 3.81) levels. In all comparisons, there was a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Within the VP group, fracture risk was unrelated to total (HR (95 % CI) 0.91 (0.71 to 1.17)) or relative (HR (95 % CI) 1.31 (0.15 to 11.48)) cement volume or cement leakage (HR (95 % CI) 1.20 (0.63 to 2.31)).
Conclusion: 
For patients undergoing VP, our study did not demonstrate significant increases in subsequent fracture risk beyond that experienced by those with vertebral fractures who did not undergo the procedure. However, because of the non-significant numerical increases observed, studies with adequate power are needed to draw definite conclusions about fracture risk.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To analyze the non-operation related risk factors of the wound complications by using lateral extensive L-shaped incision for open reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 58 patients with closed calcaneal fractures (63 calcaneus) treated by using lateral intensive L-shaped incision for open reduction and internal fixation between September 2006 and August 2011. There were 52 males (56 calcaneus) and 6 females (7 calcaneus), aged 18 to 64 years (mean, 35 years). The causes of injury included fall injury in 53 cases (58 calcaneus), traffic injury in 5 cases (5 calcaneus). The mean time between injury and operation was 8 days (range, 3-22 days). According to Sanders classification, 4 calcaneus were rated as type II, 31 calcaneus as type III, and 28 calcaneus as type IV. Postoperative complications were observed and graded; 58 patients were divided into complication group (> or = grade 2) and control group (< grade 2). The univariate analysis was used to analyze 18 factors which may lead to wound complications; multi-factor unconditioned logistic regression analysis was done for the factors showing significant difference.
Results: 
According to postoperative wound complications grading, 41 patients (46 calcaneus) were included in the control group, whose incision healed primarily, and 17 patients (17 calcaneus) in the complication group. In 17 patients of the complication group, 14 had skin necrosis or dehiscence, and 3 had superficial infection; they obtained healing after symptomatic treatment. The univariate analysis showed significant differences in combined spinal fracture, diabetes mellitus, and long-term smoking between 2 groups (P < 0.05). The logistic regression analysis revealed that combined spinal fracture was an independent risk factor for wound complications (95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.360, P = 0.004).
Conclusion: 
Combined spinal fracture is an independent risk factor for wound complications after open reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fracture using lateral extensive L-shaped incision.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To evaluate and compare nonoperative treatment methods for traumatic thoracic and lumbar compression fractures and burst fractures.
Design: 
Prospective randomized controlled trial with long-term follow-up.
Setting: 
Two general hospitals in the Netherlands.
Patients::Participants: 
Patients with a traumatic thoracic or lumbar spine fracture, without neurologic damage, with less than 50% loss of height of the anterior column and less than 30% reduction of the spinal canal were included.
Intervention: 
Patients in the compression group were randomized to physical therapy and postural instructions, a brace for 6 weeks, or a Plaster of Paris cast for 6 or 12 weeks. Patients in the burst group received a brace or a Plaster of Paris cast, both for 12 weeks.
Main outcome measurements: 
Follow-up examinations included radiographs, Visual Analogue Scores for toleration of treatment and persistent pain, and an Oswestry Disability Index at long-term follow-up.
Results: 
There were 133 patients: 108 in the compression group and 25 in the burst group. For compression fractures, physical therapy and brace were considered the most tolerable. Brace therapy scored significantly better on the Visual Analogue Scores for residual pain and on the Oswestry Disability Index. None of the treatments had any significant effect on the residual deformity measurements. For burst fractures, no significant differences were found.
Conclusions: 
Brace treatment with supplementary physical therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Furthermore, more than 20% of all patients had moderate or severe back pain at long-term follow-up.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A biomechanical study.
Objective: 
To study the different biomechanical property among fixed-axis, monoplanar and polyaxial screws in the static and dynamic tests.
Summary of background data: 
Correction loss is a common phenomenon in the patients with thoracolumbar vertebral fractures who underwent the posterior pedicle screw fixation. The incidence varies with the kinds of fixation instrumentation used. There is higher incidence in polyaxial pedicle screws group than in fixed-axis pedicle screws. Monoplanar pedicle screws, which are mobile in the axial plane but fixed in the sagittal plane, can be a better fixation instrumentation for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in theory.
Methods: 
A total of 30 porcine spinal units (L2-L4) were used for the static and dynamic tests, which were randomized into six groups (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3). Static test was performed in A1, A2, and A3. In this test, fixed-axis, monoplanar, and polyaxial screws were performed in A1, A2, and A3, respectively. The ultimate load was noted after tested. In addition, dynamic test was performed in B1, B2, and B3, used fixed-axis, monoplanar, and polyaxial screws, respectively. Correction loss (head-shank angle shift and anterior vertebral body height shift) was obtained and analyzed in each mode.
Results: 
In static test, fixed-axis and monoplanar screws had significantly higher ultimate load than polyaxial screws (P < 0.05) and fixed-axis screws had a little higher ultimate load than monoplanar screws (P < 0.05). In dynamic test, correction loss was minimal in fixed-axis screws, medium in monoplanar screws, and maximal in polyaxial screws. However, the differences were statistically significant in all comparisons but not in the comparison of fixed-axis and monoplanar screws (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
The findings from the current study suggest that monoplanar screws can significantly increase the stiffness in axial direction compared with polyaxial screws, and reduce the risks of correction loss. For thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, monoplanar screw is a better optional instrumentation for minimally invasive surgery.

  abstract={Introduction: 
Odontoid fractures (OF) are the most frequent cervical spine fracture type in the elderly, often following low-velocity falls. The rise in life expectancies has led to an increase in octogenarians suffering OF, for which the optimal treatment remains undetermined.
Evidence acquisition: 
A comprehensive search was conducted (National Library of Medicine MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for all articles through 03/2016. Articles were included if the study population evaluated treatment modalities in OF patients aged ≥80-years. Outcomes assessed were mortality, complications, osseous union, and fracture stability. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported.
Evidence synthesis: 
Across 22 case series/retrospective studies, attributable mortality for surgery was 5.4% (8/149) vs. 10.1% (10/99) for nonsurgery (P=0.159). Surgery patients suffered higher complications rates (38.9%, 58/149; vs. 24.5%, 26/106); OR 1.96 ([1.13-3.40], P=0.016). Osseous union was better achieved with surgery (68.5%, 37/54; vs. 43.2%, 16/37); OR 2.86 ([1.20-6.80]; P=0.016). Fracture stability was better achieved with surgery (86.0%, 49/57; vs. 63.6%, 28/44); OR 3.50 ([1.33-9.21], P=0.009).
Conclusions: 
In general, octogenarians undergoing surgery for OF showed higher fusion and stability rates compared to nonsurgery, which may be due in part to surgical selection criteria, surgeon preference and patient comorbidities. Higher complications were observed for surgery patients, while no differences were observed for mortality. Prospective trials are greatly needed to identify the optional treatment modality and predictors of clinical outcome in octogenarians suffering OF.},

  abstract={Background: 
Odontoid plate fixation without C1-C2 arthrodesis appears to be a practicable option for the management of odontoid fractures that are not amenable for conventional screw fixation. The purpose of this study was to measure the mechanical stability of odontoid plate fixation using a specially designed plate construct, and to compare the results to those after conventional screw fixation.
Methods: 
The second cervical vertebra was removed from twenty fresh human spinal columns. Stiffness and failure load of the intact odontoid were measured, and type II odontoid fractures were created. Afterward, the specimens were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: Group I: plate-fixation; Group II: 2-AO-screw-fixation; Group III: 1-AO-screw-fixation; Group IV: Herbert-screw-fixation. In a second series, stiffness and failure load of the stabilized odontoid fractures were assessed for comparison and statistical analysis.
Findings: 
Group I showed a significantly higher mean failure load than the other groups. The mean failure load of Group I after fixation of the odontoid fracture was 86% of the mean failure load of the intact odontoid. Comparing Groups II, III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding the failure load. In these three groups the mean failure load after odontoid fixation was approximately 50% of the mean failure load of the intact odontoid.
Interpretation: 
Odontoid plate fixation as an alternative procedure in certain fracture patterns provided a significantly higher biomechanical stability than the technique of odontoid screw fixation. Using a specially designed plate construct, 86% of the original stability of the intact odontoid was restored.},

  abstract={Surgical treatment of type II odontoid fractures (OFs) has usually entailed C1-2 arthrodesis rather than fracture fixation. An alternative treatment of direct screw fixation is used to treat the fractures for preservation of atlantoaxial rotation. Type II OFs that cannot be completely reduced by close means are generally believed to be a contraindication for anterior screw fixation. Seven patients (group I) with displaced type II OFs that could be completely reduced were treated with fracture fixation by one 4.5-mm double-threaded compression screw and five patients (group II) with displaced type II OFs that could only be partially reduced were treated with fracture fixation by one 3.0-mm double-threaded compression screw. All patients had a minimum of 1-year follow-up. No major complications occurred. No loss of reduction occurred in group I patients. Group II patients had an average loss of reduction of 0.8 mm anterior displacement and 5 degrees anterior angulation. The overall rate of fracture union was 100%, and fracture resolution averaged 4.1 months. Ten patients had a normal range of cervical rotation, and there was no difference in preservation of cervical rotation between the two groups. Our results suggest that close reduction and compressive osteosynthesis by one double-threaded compression screw is an optimal method of treatment for displaced type II OFs that can be completely reduced and for some cases that can only be partially reduced. A 100% rate of fracture union and preservation of cervical rotation are the major advantages of this method. However, significant complications have been reported by other investigators.

  abstract={Objective: 
To explore the therapeutic methods of fracture and dislocation of coccyx and evaluate its curative effects.
Methods: 
From May 2002 to March 2010,56 patients with fracture and dislocation of coccyx were divided into surgical treatment group and non-surgical treatment group. There were 7 males and 20 females in surgical treatment group with an average age of (48.1 +/- 0.6) years (ranged, 29 to 62 years), treated with open reduction and mini-plate internal fixation. There were 8 males and 21 females in non-surgical treatment group with an average age of (47.5 +/- 0.9) years (ranged, 19 to 54 years),treated with manipulative reduction. All patients were underwent X-ray examination and were finally diagnosed before treatment. Clinical symptoms and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) of all patients were statistically analyzed before and after treatment.
Results: 
There was no significant difference between two groups in gender, age, BMI index and VAS evaluation. All patients were followed up from 12 to 25 months with an average of 17.2 months. In surgical treatment group,there were 26 cases with I/a incision and 1 case with II/a incision; the excellent rate of clinical symptom was respectively 92.6% and 100% at leaving hospital and final follow-up; the improvement rate of VAS was 97.6% and was excellent result;internal fixtures were removed at the 1 to 2 years after treatment and no unwell symptoms occurred; VAS of all patients in the group was 0 point. In non-surgical treatment group,the excellent rate of clinical symptom was respectively 72.4% and 82.8% at leaving hospital and final follow-up; the improvement rate of VAS was 72.1% and was good result. There was significant difference in clinical results between two groups (P<0.05).
Conclusion: 
The results indicated that fracture and dislocation of coccyx should be treated in time. For the treatment of patients with manipulative reduction failures, instability reduction by X-ray examination and serious rectal irritation, open reduction and mini-plate internal fixation can obtain satisfactory results.},

  abstract={Object: 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the criteria described in the literature as the indications for surgery for acute Type II odontoid fractures.
Methods: 
The authors searched the PubMed database for studies in which the fusion rate of acute Type II odontoid fractures following external immobilization (halo vest or collar) or surgery (posterior C1-2 fusion or anterior screw fixation) was reported. The only studies included reported the fusion rate for either 1) groups of patients whose age was either more or less than a certain age range (45-55 years); or 2) groups of patients with a fracture displacement of either more or less than a certain odontoid fracture displacement (4-6 mm) or the direction of displacement (see Methods section of text for more details). A meta-analysis in which the random effect model was used was conducted to analyze the data.
Results: 
There was a statistically significantly higher fusion rate for operative management compared with external immobilization (85 vs 60%, p = 0.01) for the patients > 45-55 years. However, the overall fusion rate was > 80% for the patients whose age was < 45-55 years, regardless of treatment modality, and no significant differences were observed between surgically and nonsurgically treated patients (89 and 81%, respectively; p = 0.29). The result of operation (overall fusion rate 89%) was superior to external immobilization (44%) when the fracture was posteriorly displaced (p < 0.001), but for anteriorly displaced fractures, the results of operative and nonoperative management were identical (p = 0.15). The overall fusion rate of operative management of both anteriorly and posteriorly displaced fractures proved to be > 85%, and no statistically significant difference was observed (p = 0.50). For all degrees of displacement (either > or < 4-6 mm) the operation proved to provide significantly better results than conservative treatment. The fusion rate of conservatively treated fractures with < 4-6 mm displacement was significantly better than in fractures with > 4-6 mm displacement (76 vs 41%, p = 0.002).
Conclusions: 
Operative treatment (posterior C1-2 fixation or anterior screw fixation) provides a better fusion rate than external immobilization for acute odontoid Type II fractures, although in certain situations, such as anterior displacement of the fracture and for younger (< 45-55 years of age) patients, conservative management (halo vest or collar immobilization) can be as effective as surgery. Operative management is recommended in older patients, in cases of posterior displacement of the fracture, and when there is displacement of > 4-6 mm.},

  abstract={Objective: 
There has been minimal literature reporting on results of osteoporotic burst fracture with spinal canal compromise treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic burst fracture is controversial. We want to clarify whether the osteoporotic burst fracture with spinal canal compromise is a contraindication to percutaneous vertebroplasty. To compare the clinical and radiological results between osteoporotic burst and compression fractures treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Patients and methods: 
From 2005 through 2006, 23 osteoporotic burst fracture patients with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise and 41 osteoporotic compression fracture patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. Pre- and post-operative pain scores, functional and radiographic results and complications were analyzed.
Results: 
The average canal compromise in study group was 15% (5-49%). The mean post-operative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Score (VAS), kyphotic angle, vertebral body height measurement from the anterior, central and posterior part of the body are all significantly improved in both the study and control groups when compared to pre-operative data. However, there was no significant difference between study and control groups in pre- and post-operative ODI, VAS, kyphotic angle and improvement of body height. There were no significant differences (P=0.3797) in cement leakage rate between burst and compression groups (47.8% vs 36.6%). All the leakages were minor and without neurological deficit. The percentage of adjacent fractures in both groups also had no significant differences (39.1% in burst and 41.5% in compression group).
Conclusions: 
Osteoporotic burst fracture with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise is not a contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplasty. This procedure is suitable for both osteoporotic burst and compression fracture with careful surgical technique.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To assess the clinical and radiologic outcome of osteoporotic thoracolumbar junctional fracture accompanied by spinous process fracture (SPF) without posterior ligament injury.
Methods: 
A total of 391 patients with single-level osteoporotic thoracolumbar junctional (T10-L2) fracture were selectively enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups by absence (group I) or presence (group II) of SPF. Clinical and radiologic parameters were compared between the two groups.
Results: 
Group I comprised of 332 patients with only vertebral body fracture, and group II comprised of 59 patients with both vertebral body and SPFs. In all cases of group II, SPFs were located just one level above the fractured vertebral body, and the injury of the posterior ligament was not found. At the time of injury, group II patients showed worse outcomes in anterior vertebral body compression percentage, kyphotic Cobb angle, cranial disk status, and the rate of the initial neurologic injury. Kyphotic alignment changes during 1-year follow-up were compared between the conservative subgroups of groups I and II. At the time of injury, there were no statistical differences in anterior vertebral body compression percentage and Cobb angle between the two conservative subgroups. However, the difference was significant after 1-year follow-up. Comparison of kyphotic alignment change at 12 months after diagnosis within group II was done according to the treatment method. Vertebroplasty subgroup in group II did not show benefit even in preventing such kyphotic alignment change, whereas instrumentation subgroup in group II showed lordotic alignment restoration despite more severe kyphotic alignment at the time of injury.
Conclusions: 
Osteoporotic thoracolumbar junctional fracture accompanied by spinous process fracture without posterior ligament injury represented more severe injury with flexion forces on the anterior column and tensile forces on the posterior column, and was related with more severe posttraumatic kyphotic changes during the 12-month follow-up.},

  abstract={Background: 
Osteoporosis is a very common disease and often results in vertebral fractures. The Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41) is a tool to measure health-related quality of life in these patients. This study aimed to cross-culturally translate and validate the QUALEFFO-41 in Iran.
Methods: 
This was a prospective clinical validation study. A forward-backward procedure was used to translate the questionnaire from English into Persian. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation were made in accordance with published guidelines. Patients were divided into two study groups according to the World Health Organization criteria: those with at least one vertebral fracture who had undergone surgery and those with osteoporosis and no fractures as a control group. All of the participants were assessed by both the QUALEFFO-41 and SF-36. The surgery group was asked to respond to the QUALEFFO-41 at two points in time: the pre- and postoperative assessments (6-month follow-up). To test reliability, the internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Validity was evaluated by assessing convergent validity between the QUALEFFO-41 and SF-36 and item-scale correlations and discriminatory ability. Internal responsiveness of the QUALEFFO-41 to the clinical intervention (surgery) also was evaluated comparing patients' pre- and postoperative scores.
Results: 
A total of 149 patients completed the questionnaire: 48 surgical patients and 101 as a control group. At the pre- and postoperative assessments, the QUALEFFO-41 showed adequate internal consistency in all domains (Cronbach's alpha of 0.71 to 0.81). Additionally, the correlation of each item with its hypothesized domain on the QUALEFFO-41 indicated acceptable results, suggesting that the items had a substantial relationship with their own domains. Further analysis also indicated that the questionnaire was responsive to change (P < 0.0001). Significant correlations existed between scores of similar subscales of the QUALEFFO-41 and SF-36 (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
The findings show that the Iranian version of the QUALEFFO-41 is a reliable and valid measure of functionality and quality-of-life evaluation among patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To study the outcomes of surgeries for acute central cervical spinal cord injury without cervical spine fracture or dislocation in young and middle-aged patients.
Methods: 
The clinical data of 58 young and middle-aged patients with acute central cervical spinal cord injury treated in our hospital between August 2005 and August 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Of these patients, 33 (24 males and 9 females) received surgical treatment and 25 (17 males and 8 females) had conservative therapy. The ASIA grade and ASIA motor and sensory score were used for evaluation at admission and at 14 days and 1 year after the treatment. The neurological symptoms and treatment outcomes in the two groups were evaluated.
Results: 
The proportion of patients with ASIA grade D-E and the ASIA motor and sensory scores were all significantly higher in the surgical group than in the non-surgical treatment group (P<0.05).
Conclusion: 
For young and middle-aged patients with central cervical spinal cord injury, immediate surgery can relieve the pressure on the injured spinal cord and improve the micro-circulation to promote functional recovery of the spinal cord.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Many studies demonstrate that both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are superior to conservative therapy in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, which included prospective non-randomized, retrospective comparative, and randomized studies.
Materials and methods: 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science databases for studies of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty from 1 January 1990 to 30 November 2014 and compared the following outcomes: procedure characteristics, pain and disability improvement, complications and anatomic outcomes. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing pain outcomes based on the risk of bias.
Results: 
29 studies enrolling 2838 patients (1384 kyphoplasty and 1454 vertebroplasty) were included. 16 prospective non-randomized studies, 10 retrospective comparative studies, and 3 randomized controlled studies were included. No significant differences were found in mean pain scores between the two groups postoperatively (2.9±1.5 kyphoplasty vs 2.9±1.7 vertebroplasty, p=0.39) and at 12 months (2.7±1.8 kyphoplasty vs 3.2±1.8 vertebroplasty, p=0.64). No significant differences were found in disability postoperatively (34.7±7.1 kyphoplasty group vs 36.3±7.8 vertebroplasty group, p=0.74) or at 12 months (28.3±16 kyphoplasty group vs 29.6±13.9 vertebroplasty group, p=0.70). Kyphoplasty was associated with lower odds of new fractures (p=0.06), less extraosseous cement leakage (p<0.01), and greater reduction in kyphotic angle (p<0.01).
Conclusions: 
No significant difference was found between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in short- and long-term pain and disability outcomes. Further studies are needed to better determine if any particular subgroups of patients would benefit more from vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral body compression fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To evaluate the clinical efficacy, especially the pain reduction, of vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Methods: 
Eighty-six patients with OVCFs were treated with vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty. All patients were followed up for seven-36 months. Visual analog scale (VAS), vertebral height, and local kyphotic angle were evaluated at pre-operation, postoperation, and final follow-up.
Results: 
The VAS pain score decreased significantly after surgery in both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty groups (p < 0.001), and the improvement of VAS score had no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.826). There was a significant difference in the improvement of vertebral height (p < 0.001) and local kyphotic angle (p < 0.001) between the two groups. Improvement of VAS score had no correlation with improvement of vertebral height (vertebroplasty: r = -0.029, p = 0.869; kyphoplasty: r = 0.175, p = 0.219) or local kyphotic angle (vertebroplasty: r = 0.159, p = 0.361; kyphoplasty: r = 0.144, p = 0.312) in either group.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective procedures for the reduction of pain in OVCFs, and they have the same efficient effect on pain reduction. Correction of vertebral height and local kyphosis may have minimal effect on pain reduction.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Focal point tenderness over the fractured level is believed to be a necessary criterion for performing vertebroplasty. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the presence of focal-point tenderness over a fracture treated with vertebroplasty predicts superior clinical outcome as compared with outcomes in patients without such tenderness.
Materials and methods: 
In this retrospective study, we divided patients into 3 groups on the basis of pain patterns noted during history and physical examination before an initial vertebroplasty in 534 consecutive patients. Group 1 comprised 373 (70%) of 534 patients with focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures. Group 2 comprised 119 (22%) patients with focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures as well as subjective off-midline pain or focal tenderness to palpation over nontreated vertebrae. Group 3 comprised 42 (8%) patients without focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures but with subjective off-midline pain or tenderness to palpation over nontreated vertebrae. Outcomes included pain at rest and with activity as well as the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score. Statistical tools included the 2-tailed t test with a Bonferroni adjustment.
Results: 
Baseline pain at rest and with activity was not different among groups, but the proportion of group 3 patients maintained on a narcotic anesthesia preprocedure was less than that of groups 1 and 2 (P = .02 compared with both groups). Group 3 achieved significantly lower pain scores at rest at 1 month (P < .0001 compared with group 1 and P < .001 compared with group 2).
Conclusion: 
The presence of focal-point tenderness does not predict superior clinical response following vertebroplasty compared with the absence of focal tenderness. Even patients without focal tenderness may benefit from vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Presence of bone marrow edema (BME) in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) detected by MR imaging as selection criterion for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is speculative. To clarify significance of BME in VCF, we assessed pain response after PV in patients with VCF with full BME versus patients with VCF with absent BME.
Methods: 
From a cohort of patients with painful VCF selected for PV, pain response in 14 patients with absent BME in VCF was prospectively compared with pain response in 31 patients with full BME in VCF. Pain was evaluated before PV and at 1 and 3 months after PV with visual analog scores and analgesics used. Back pain in general and at treated vertebral levels was assessed.
Results: 
Pain decrease after PV at treated levels was observed in 10 (71%) patients with absent BME in VCF at both follow-up periods and in 29 (94%) patients with full BME 1 month after PV and 30 (97%) at 3 months after PV. Differences between the groups were significant (P = .04 at 1 month; P = .01 at 3 months). Pain response was not affected by other patient or imaging characteristics. General back pain after PV was comparable in both groups after PV (P = .08 at 1 month; P = .4 at 3 months).
Conclusion: 
Pain decrease after PV in patients with VCF is more frequently observed when full BME is present. Because 71% of patients with VCF with absent BME responded favorably on pain, PV should not be withheld based on absence of BME alone.},

  abstract={Background: 
Although percutaneous posterior-ring tension-band metallic plate and percutaneous iliosacral screws are used to fix unstable posterior pelvic ring fractures, the biomechanical stability and compatibility of both internal fixation techniques for the treatment of Denis I, II and III type vertical sacral fractures remain unclear.
Methods: 
Using CT and MR images of the second generation of Chinese Digitized Human "male No. 23", two groups of finite element models were developed for Denis I, II and III type vertical sacral fractures with ipsilateral superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures treated with either a percutaneous metallic plate or a percutaneous screw. Accordingly, two groups of clinical cases that were fixed using the above-mentioned two internal fixation techniques were retrospectively evaluated to compare postoperative effect and function. Parallel analysis was performed with a finite element model controlled trial and a case control study.
Results: 
The difference of the postoperative Majeed standards and outcome rates between two case groups was no statistically significant (P > 0.05). Accordingly, the high values of the maximum displacements/stresses of the plate-fixation model group approximated those of the screw-fixation model group. However, further simulation of Denis I, II and III type fractures in each group of models found that the biomechanics of the plate-fixation models became increasingly stable and compatible, whereas the biomechanics of the screw-fixation models maintained tiny fluctuations. When treating Denis III fractures, the biomechanical effects of the pelvic ring of the plate-fixation model were better than the screw-fixation model.
Conclusions: 
Percutaneous plate and screw fixations are both appropriate for the treatment of Denis I and II type vertical sacral fractures; whereas percutaneous plate fixation appears be superior to percutaneous screw fixation for Denis III type vertical sacral fracture. Biomechanical evidence of finite element evaluations combined with clinical evidence will contribute to our ability to distinguish between indications that require plate or screw fixation for vertical sacral fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation technique used in patients with oligometastatic lung disease. Lung and chest wall toxicities have been described in the patients but pathological vertebral fracture is an adverse effect no reported in patients treated with SBRT for lung metastases.
Case presentation: 
A 68-year-old woman with the diagnosis of a recurrence of a single lung metastatic nodule of urothelial carcinoma after third line of chemotherapy. The patient received a hypo-fractionated course of SBRT.A 3D-conformal multifield technique was used with six coplanar and one non-coplanar statics beams. A total dose of 48 Gy in three fractions over six days was prescribed to the 95% of the CTV. Ten months after the SBRT procedure, a CT scan showed complete response of the metastatic disease without signs of radiation pneumonitis. However, rib and vertebral bone toxicities were observed with the fracture-collapse of the 7th and 8th vertebral bodies and a fracture of the 7th and 8th left ribs. We report a unique case of pathological vertebral fracture appearing ten months after SBRT for an asymptomatic growing lung metastases of urothelial carcinoma.
Conclusion: 
Though SBRT allows for minimization of normal tissue exposure to high radiation doses SBRT tolerance for vertebral bone tissue has been poorly evaluated in patients with lung tumors. Oncologists should be alert to the potential risk of fatal bone toxicity caused by this novel treatment. We recommend BMD testing in all woman over 65 years old with clinical risk factors that could contribute to low BMD. If low BMD is demonstrated, we should carefully restrict the maximum radiation dose in the vertebral body in order to avoid intermediate or low radiation dose to the whole vertebral body.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The anatomy and biomechanics of the growing spine produce failure patterns different from those in adults. Spinal injury in the pediatric patient is a concern as prevention of further neurologic damage and deformity and the good potential for recovery make timely identification and appropriate treatment of such injury critical. A retrospective clinical case series was conducted to present data from a large series of pediatric patients with spine injuries from a single regional trauma center.
Methods: 
One hundred thirty-seven children with spine injuries were seen over 10 years and were divided into three age groups: 0-9, 10-14, and 15-17 years. Analysis of variance and chi2 were used to analyze differences between groups.
Results: 
There were 36 patients aged 0-9, 49 aged 10-14, and 52 aged 15-17. Spine injury incidence increased with age. Motor vehicular accidents were the most common cause in this series. There were 36% cervical, 34% thoracic, 29% lumbar, 34% multilevel contiguous, and 7% multilevel noncontiguous involvement. Nineteen percent had spinal cord injury. Thirteen of 21 complete neurologic injuries and all 3 incomplete injuries improved. Cord injury was more common in the 0-9 age group. Four of five patients with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) were in the 0-9 age group and had complete neurologic injuries. Young children with cervical injuries were more likely to die than older children. Fifty-three percent had associated injuries. Eighteen percent underwent decompression, fusion, and instrumentation. Two patients developed scoliosis. The complication rate in surgical patients was higher than in patients treated nonsurgically and in polytrauma patients. This may be related to the severity of the initial injury.
Conclusions: 
Our results suggest age-related patterns of injury that differ from previous work. The incidence of cord injury is 20% with higher frequencies in the young child. Potential for neurologic recovery is good. Young children have a higher risk for death than older children. There was no predominance of cervical injuries in the young child. The incidence of SCIWORA was low. Higher complication rates were seen in polytrauma and surgical patients.},

  abstract={Study design: 
The case report of a 60-year-old man with late onset back pain after lumbar spine fusion is presented.
Objective: 
To report the rare complication of bilateral pedicle stress fractures after instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion.
Summary of background data: 
A 56-year-old man underwent revision spinal surgery for ongoing back pain secondary to pseudoarthroses. A posterolateral L4-S1 instrumented fusion using pedicle screws was performed. Autologous bone graft was applied to the decorticated lateral masses. The internal fixation was removed 2 years later, at which time plain radiographs showed that the fusion mass was solid. At the age of 60 years, the man presented with worsening back pain. Plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans demonstrated bilateral L4 pedicle stress fractures. A bone scan indicated that these were recent in origin.
Method: 
The clinical assessment was undertaken by the senior author and surgeon. Investigations included plain radiography, computer tomography, and scintographic imaging. A systematic literature review of the relevant publications was performed.
Results: 
In the reported patient, bilateral pedicle stress fractures developed 2 years after pedicle screw removal from an L4-S1 instrumented posterolateral lumbar spine fusion. This occurred at the uppermost level of the fusion mass.
Conclusions: 
The pedicle is the weakest point in the neural arch after posterolateral fusion. Although movement continues at the level of the disc space anteriorly, the pedicle is susceptible to fracture. Pedicle fracture is a rare late complication of posterolateral lumbar spine fusion.},

Fifty-two patients with severe fractures, spondylolisthesis, or pseudoarthrosis of T10 to L5 were treated using a computer assisted technique on 1/2 the patients and performing the screw insertion manually for the other 1/2. At the same time, 28 pedicle screws were inserted in T12 to L4 vertebrae for scoliosis with the help of the computer assisted technique. Surgery was followed in all cases (66 vertebrae; 132 pedicle screws) by postoperative radiographs and computed tomographic examination, on which measurements of screw position relative to pedicle position could be done. For fractures, spondylolisthesis, or pseudarthrosis, comparison between the two groups showed that four screws in 52 (8%) vertebrae had incorrect placement with computer assisted technique whereas 22 screws in 52 (42%) vertebrae had incorrect placement with manual insertion. In patients with scoliosis, four screws in 28 (14%) vertebrae had incorrect placement. In all of the patients (132 pedicle screws) there were no neurologic complications. These results show that a computer assisted technique is much more accurate and safe than manual insertion.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND The definition of a vertebral fracture is usually based on the presence of a deformation of the vertebral body and this can be misleading in the presence of a fracture without radiologic collapse with the definition of occult osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OOVFs). STIR sequence of MRI images showing hyperintensity signal was the most confirmative screening examination used to determine the presence of painful OOVFs. To date, clinical management of OOVFs has been rarely discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2013, 89 patients suffering from painful OOVFs underwent 142 percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) procedures. Outcome data (mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height, visual analog scale [VAS] scores, Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] scores, and SF-36 scores) were recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 2 year after treatment, to evaluate the results. RESULTS We successfully treated 89 patients (142 vertebral bodies) with PKP. Cement leakages were observed in 12 (8.45%) treated vertebral bodies and there were 5 new adjacent vertebral fractures during the follow-up period. The mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height changed from 96.5±3.4% preoperatively to 97.2±2.5% postoperatively (p>0.05) and from 96.3±2.8% preoperatively to 97.9±3.1% postoperatively (p>0.05), respectively. The mean VAS scores were reduced significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery (8.3±1.2 to 2.9±0.7; p<0.05), as was the ODI score (76.4±12.5 to 26.7±5.6; p<0.05). The SF-36 scores, including Bodily Pain (BF), Vitality (VT), Physical Function (PF), and Social Functioning (SF), all showed notable improvement (P<0.05). These variations were maintained during the 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS PKP is a safe and effective method in the treatment of painful OOVFs.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The treatment of vertebral burst fractures is still controversial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the purpose of additional percutaneous intravertebral reduction when combined with dorsal instrumentation.
Methods: 
In this biomechanical cadaver study twenty-eight spine segments (T11-L3) were used (male donors, mean age 64.9 ± 6.5 years). Burst fractures of L1 were generated using a standardised protocol. After fracture all spines were allocated to four similar groups and randomised according to surgical techniques (posterior instrumentation; posterior instrumentation + intravertebral reduction device + cement augmentation; posterior instrumentation + intravertebral reduction device without cement; and intravertebral reduction device + cement augmentation). After treatment, 100000 cycles (100-600 N, 3 Hz) were applied using a servohydraulic loading frame.
Results: 
Overall anatomical restoration was better in all groups where the intravertebral reduction device was used (p < 0.05). In particular, it was possible to restore central endplates (p > 0.05). All techniques decreased narrowing of the spinal canal. After loading, clearance could be maintained in all groups fitted with the intravertebral reduction device. Narrowing increased in the group treated with dorsal instrumentation.
Conclusions: 
For height and anatomical restoration, the combination of an intravertebral reduction device with dorsal instrumentation showed significantly better results than sole dorsal instrumentation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) could achieve rapid pain relief for older patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Bone cement in PKP was the key factor keeping the stabilization of the vertebral body. However, the same amount of cement can distribute differently in a vertebral body and can thereby result in different surgery outcomes. Therefore, the volume and distribution of bone cement should be considered as 2 distinct variables to evaluate the effectiveness of PKP.
Objectives: 
On the basis of comparing surgery outcomes between patients with different recovery states measured by visual analog scores (VAS) and exploring the relationships among bone cement, surgery outcomes, and degrees of pain relief, the objective of the study is to determine the best combination of cement volume and cement distribution for PKP.
Study design: 
Retrospective study.
Methods: 
There were 220 patients with 220 vertebra who received PKP in our hospital from January 2011 to January 2013. According to the different pain relief degrees, patients were divided into 2 groups. The epidemiological data, surgical outcomes, and complications were compared between the 2 groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the diagnostic value of bone cement on patient recovery state. A correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between bone cement and surgery outcomes. Moreover, logistic regression was also used to assess the safety of cement injection.
Results: 
There were 77 recuperators and 143 non-recuperators in our study. There were no differences in epidemiological data between the 2 groups. However, the surgery duration, cement volume, cement distribution, restoration rate of vertebral height, and improvement of kyphotic angle in the recuperator group were all higher than those in the non-recuperator group. The area under the ROC curve of cement distribution as a predictor of pain relief was better than that of cement volume (0.77 vs. 0.65, P < 0.05). Cement distribution had a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 84% when it was at 0.49. Cement volume had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 82% when it was at 3.80 mL. All patients were then divided into 4 parts based on the 2 values. Extensive cement distribution (more than or equal to 0.49) was discovered to noticeably increase the recuperative rate both for a small cement volume (less than 3.80 mL) and a large cement volume (more than or equal to 3.80 mL). A small cement volume with an extensive distribution had the same recuperative effect as a large cement volume with a confined distribution (x² = 2.880, P = 0.090). When the cement volume was constant, cement distribution was positively correlated with the restoration rate of vertebral height and improvement of the kyphotic angle (r² = 0.207, P < 0.01; r² = 0.159, P = 0.02), but cement distribution was not a risk factor for cement leakage or adjacent vertebral fractures (OR = 35.760, 95%CI: 0.096 - 13291.207, P > 0.05; OR = 0.051, 95% CI: 0.011 - 1.032, P > 0.05). Although a large cement volume may contribute to the restoration of vertebral height (r² = 0.153, P < 0.05), it was found to be a risk factor for adjacent vertebral fractures (OR = 1.733, 95% CI: 1.158 - 2.595, P < 0.05).
Limitations: 
The distribution of cement in fractured vertebra was not calcuated accurately.
Conclusions: 
The diagnostic value of cement distribution is better than that for cement volume in relieving patient pain. A cement distribution above 0.49 with a small cement volume should be suggested for PKP. An extensive cement distribution can improve the kyphotic angle and vertebral height effectively, and it does not cause cement leakage or adjacent vertebral fractures.
Key words:

  abstract={Objective: 
To discuss the clinical effects of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for acute and chronic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF).
Methods: 
From June 2006 to October 2011,42 senior patients with OVCF were treated with PKP. There were 5 males and 37 females,ranging in age from 60 to 86 years old with an average of (73.3+/-7.5) years old. The patients were divided into two groups (acute group and chronic group) according to the course,MRI and whether or not undergoing systematically conservative. VAS and ADL scoring systems were used to evaluate the pain and daily activities. X-ray was used to evaluate the vertebral height restoration rate and the kyphosis correction rate.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 10 to 64 months with an average of 17 months. At 1 week and 6 months after operation in two groups, VAS and ADL scores decreased significantly (P<0.05) ;VAS and ADL scores at 6 months after operation were higher than at 1 week after operation (P>0.05). But the improvement rates of the pain and daily activities of acute group were better than that of chronic group (P<0.05). At 1 week after operation,the restoration rate of anterior and middle vertebral height,the kyphotic correction rate in acute group were better than that of chronic group (P<0.05). CONCLUCSION: Using PKP to treat both acute and chronic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can get good effects,but acute patients can obtain better effects than chronic patients,it has obviously advantages of relieving pain,correcting kyphotic angle,recovering vertebral height.},

To retrospectively assess the feasibility and safety of percutaneous minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation for cervical fracture using intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation.
Methods: 
Thirty patients admitted from April 2012 to May 2014 in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital with cervical fracture underwent pedicle screw fixation using intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation, with 8 patients using minimally invasive technique (CAOS-MIS group), and the other 22 patients using conventional open approach (CAOS-open group). Operative time, blood loss and postoperative neurovascular complications were recorded. Screw positions were studied by postoperative CT scan. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Neck visual analogue score (VAS) and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification were evaluated preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. Independent-sample t test and Chi-Square test were used for statistical analysis.
Results: 
Operation time was (139 ± 18) minutes and blood loss was (73 ± 40) ml in CAOS-MIS group and correspondingly (154 ± 42) minutes and (296 ± 171) ml in CAOS-open group. The blood loss in CAOS-MIS group was significantly lower than that in CAOS-open group (t = 5.695, P < 0.01). No screw-related injury to nerve or vertebral artery was observed. Thirty-four screws were placed in CAOS-MIS group with 28 screws (82.4%) classified as Grade I, meanwhile in CAOS-open group 108 screws were placed with 96 screws (88.9%) classified as Grade I. There was no statistical difference between the two groups (χ² = 0.998, P > 0.01). VAS score showed no statistical difference preoperatively (t = 0.334, P > 0.01), however statistical difference existed at 6 months follow-up (t = 4.111, P < 0.01) with (0.4 ± 0.5) in CAOS-MIS group and (1.5 ± 0.7) in CAOS-open group. There were 1 patient from class B to improve to D, 1 case from D to E in CAOS-MIS group, and 1 patient from class A to improve to B, 1 case from B to D, 2 cases from C to D, 3 cases from D to E in CAOS-open group 6 months after surgery. Cervical X-ray demonstrated fractures healed well in all cases at 6 months follow-up.
Conclusion: 
It is feasible and safe for percutaneous minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation for cervical fracture using intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation, which can also decreases the incidence of postoperative neck pain.},

To evaluate outcomes after percutaneous application of transilial pinning in dogs with seventh lumbar vertebral body fracture with concurrent lumbosacral luxation.
Methods: 
We reviewed the medical records of dogs with seventh lumbar vertebral body fracture stabilized with percutaneous transilial pinning that were treated at our hospital between January 2000 and March 2014. Radiographic measurements were used for comparing craniocaudal and ventrodorsal displacement pre- and postoperatively.
Results: 
Seventeen dogs met the inclusion criteria. The neurological status of the majority of treated dogs improved quickly, with immediate pain reduction after surgery. Implants were well tolerated throughout the application period and were removed at a mean time of 54.4 ± 9.2 days. One dog experienced a major complication (implant failure) and required surgical revision a week after the initial procedure. Minor complications included pin-tract inflammation, signs of back pain lasting five weeks and acute lameness after implant removal. Postoperative radiographic measurements showed shortening of the vertebral body and residual dorsoventral dislocation. Otherwise, functional recovery was good (5 of 17 dogs) to excellent (10 of 17 dogs) in the majority of the patients.
Clinical relevance: 
The use of two percutaneous transilial pins can be considered as treatment for the management of seventh lumbar fracture-luxation in dogs. Our modified stabilization technique is relatively easy to perform; less invasive on the soft tissues; and uses implants that are versatile, modifiable, and easily removable.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are being increasingly treated with minimally invasive bone augmentation techniques such as kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. Both are reported to be an effective means of pain relief; however, there may be an increased risk of developing subsequent VCFs after such procedures.
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and complication profile of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in a single patient series.
Study design::Setting: 
A clinical series of 36 patients with VCFs treated by vertebral augmentation procedures was retrospectively analyzed for surgical approach, volume of cement injected, cement extravasation (symptomatic and asymptomatic), the occurrence of subsequent adjacent level fracture, and pain relief.
Patient sample: 
Thirty-six patients with 46 VCFs underwent either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty after failing conservative therapy. The mean patient age was not significantly different between the kyphoplasty group (70; range, 46-83) and vertebroplasty group (72; range, 38-90) (p=.438).
Outcome measures: 
Outcomes were assessed by using self-report measures (a comparative pain rating scale) and physiologic measures (pre- and postoperative radiographs).
Methods: 
Thirty-six patients with VCFs underwent 46 augmentation procedures (17 patients had 20 fractures treated via kyphoplasty, and 19 patients had 26 fractures treated via vertebroplasty). Seventeen patients in this series underwent kyphoplasty using standard techniques involving bone void creation with balloon tamps, followed by cement injection. Nineteen patients underwent a percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure using a novel cannulated, fenestrated bone tap developed to direct cement anteriorly into the vertebral body to avoid backflow of cement onto neural elements.
Results: 
Pain improvement was seen in >90% of patients in both groups. Mean cement injection per vertebral body was 4.65 mL and 3.78 mL for the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty groups, respectively (p=.014). Ninety-five percent of the kyphoplasty procedures were performed bilaterally, whereas only 19% of the vertebroplasty procedures required bilateral augmentation (p<.001). There was no cement extravasation resulting in radiculopathy, or myelopathy in either group. Asymptomatic cement extravasation was seen in 5 of 46 (11%) of the total series (3/20 [15%] and 2/26 [7.7%] of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, respectively) (p=.696). Within a 3-month period, there were 5 new adjacent level fractures seen in 3 patients who underwent a kyphoplasty procedure (5/20 [25%]) and none in the vertebroplasty group (p<.05).
Conclusions: 
Vertebroplasty appears to offer a comparable rate of postoperative pain relief as kyphoplasty while using less bone cement more often via a unilateral approach and without the attendant risk of adjacent level fracture.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral metastases are associated with significant pain, disability, and morbidity. Open surgery for fracture stabilization is often inappropriate in this cancer population due to a poor risk-benefit profile, particularly if life expectancy is short. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are appealing adjunctive procedures in patients with malignancy for alleviation of intractable pain. However, these patients have a higher risk of serious complications, notably cement extravasation.
Study design: 
We prospectively evaluated clinical results of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implant (Kiva) assisted vertebroplasty performed in malignant painful osteolytic lesions at risk for cement extravasation due to vertebral wall involvement.
Setting: 
Department of Interventional Radiology, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, Candiolo, Turin, Italy
Methods: 
Forty patients (22 women; mean age 66.8 ± 12.4), suffering from a painful spine malignancy with vertebral wall involvement not responding to conventional therapies and without surgical indications, underwent vertebral augmentation with Kiva intravertebral implant for pain palliation. The procedure was performed with moderate sedation and local anesthesia under combined digital fluoroscopy and computed tomography guidance. After the coil-shaped PEEK implant was deployed within the vertebral lesion, bone cement was injected under continuous digital fluoroscopic control. Patients were discharged from the hospital the next procedural day. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), analgesic requirement, and use of external brace support were evaluated to determine efficacy. The primary end-point was safety and efficacy at one month after the procedure. However, all the patients were scheduled to be followed-up at month 3, 6, and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up was prospectively evaluated in all patients after Kiva with clinical interviews. The Institution's Internal Review Board approved this study.
Results: 
Median pre-treatment VAS of 10 (range 6 - 10) significantly (P < 0.001) dropped to one (range 0 - 3), with all patients achieving a clinically relevant benefit on pain at one month. Differences in pre- and post-treatment analgesic therapy were significant (P < 0.001). All patients no longer use an external brace after Kiva. In 7 out of 43 (16.3%) treated vertebrae a bone cement leakage was detected.
Limitations: 
This is a not randomized study. Participants were limited to 40 patients.
Conclusion: 
The Kiva System potentially represents a novel and effective minimally invasive treatment option for patients suffering from severe pain due to osteolytic vertebral metastases.},

  abstract={A total of 47 percutaneous vertebroplasties (PVs) were performed for osteoporotic vertebral fractures in 31 patients, 25 PVs were performed using the frontal-opening cannula (FOC) and 22 using the new side-opening cannula (SOC), randomly distributed. The incidence of cement extrusion was 27% with the SOC, and 68% with the FOC, all asymptomatic (p<0.01). The pain control was similar for both groups, with good improvement of pain in most of the patients, and there were no clinical relevant complications. The cement leakage can be significantly reduced with this new SOC, which allows for a better cement injection toward the center of the vertebral body, increasing the safety of the procedure, with no increase in cost.},

  abstract={Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been performed for more than ten years to treat painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Clinical results have been encouraging, but little is known about the efficacy and safety of this minimally invasive procedure. We therefore performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A search was conducted using Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The search yielded fifteen studies, eleven prospective, three retrospective and one controlled trial. Totally 1,136 interventions were performed on 793 patients. Mean pain scores, measured using a 0 to 10 VAS score, improved significantly from 7.8 to 3.1 (-60.3%) immediately after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The short-term complication rate varied between 0.4 and 75.6%. Leakage of cement outside the vertebral body was markedly common, ranging from 3.3 to 75.6%. Although the majority was asymptomatic, a few devastating clinical adverse effects were reported (mean 2.4%). Although percutaneous vertebroplasty is a widely accepted treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, we revealed only a single controlled trial. We conclude that there are insufficient data available to reliably assess efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty. The procedure has a low rate of clinical complications, but potential complications can be devastating. In the future, assessing the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty requires controlled trials with long-term follow-up.},

After local radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the fracture was still unstable and the patient had been continuously wearing a stiff cervical collar for 9 months. Complication-free PVP resulted in pain relief and stabilization and use of the cervical collar could be discontinued. At 18 months follow-up the patient remained free from pain, the fracture was stable and she had returned to work. The purpose of this article is to present the technical facts and to highlight the benefits and potential complications of the procedure. The technical characteristics of the procedure, the indication and results of the present case are discussed together with previously reported cases of PVP treatment at C2.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Clinical randomized study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study is to compare percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) to conservative treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures in a clinical randomized study with respect to pain, physical and mental outcome, and to asses the risk of adjacent fractures.
Summary of background data: 
PVP is a therapeutic procedure performed to reduce pain in vertebral lesions. Despite the lack of comparative randomized clinical trials PVP is generally seen as a safe and efficient procedure for painful osteoporotic fractures.
Methods: 
Fifty patients (41 females) were included from January 2001 until January 2008. Patients with acute (<2 weeks) and subacute (between 2 and 8 weeks) osteoporotic fractures were included and randomized to either PVP or conservative treatment. Pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale and physical and mental outcome were assessed by validated questionnaires and tests. Tests, questionnaires, and plain radiographs were performed at the inclusion and after 3 months.
Results: 
Reduction in pain from initial visit to 3-month follow-up was comparable in the 2 groups (P = 0.33) from approximate visual analogue scale 8.0 to visual analogue scale 2.0, intragroup difference was significant (P = 0.00). Reduction in pain in the PVP group was immediate 12 to 24 hours after the procedure (P = 0.00). There was no significant difference in the other parameters when comparing the results at inclusion and after 3 months within both groups and between the groups after 3 months with a few exceptions. We observed 2 adjacent fractures in the PVP group and non in the conservative group.
Conclusion: 
The majority of patients with acute or subacute painful osteoporotic compression fractures in the spine will recover after a few months of conservative treatment. The risk of adjacent fractures needs further research. No major adverse events were observed.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective cohort study.
Objective: 
To identify the effect of cement augmentation for cephalad vertebral fracture after instrumented lumbar fusion.
Summary of background data: 
Osteoporosis may contribute to cephalad vertebral fractures by an altered biomechanics in the adjacent segments due to the loss of motion at the fused segments. However, few studies on the treatment for cephalad fractures using bone cement augmentation after instrumented lumbar fusion have been published.
Methods: 
Seventeen patients who had cephalad vertebral fractures after instrumented lumbar fusion underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). All patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of intravertebral vacuum clefts (IVC) on plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging: group 1 consisted of 9 patients without an associated IVC and group 2 consisted of 8 patients with an IVC. The Oswestry Disability Index and the Visual Analogue Scale were recorded prospectively. The radiologic parameters of kyphotic deformity, vertebral height changes, and leakage of cement were studied.
Results: 
The Oswestry Disability Index and Visual Analogue Scale scores in group 1 decreased after PVP, but the mean score in group 2 was higher than in group 1 at the last follow-up. The mean kyphosis measured 15.7±7.4 degrees preoperatively and 15.6±7.1 degrees at the final follow-up in group 1, and 16.9±8.8 degrees preoperatively and 27.2±8.8 degrees at the final follow-up in group 2.The mean preoperative anterior and posterior vertebral height ratio measured 0.6±0.2 preoperatively and 0.6±0.2 at the final follow-up in group 1, and 0.6±0.2 preoperatively and 0.5±0.2 at the final follow-up in group 2.The mean preoperative middle and posterior vertebral height ratio measured 0.5±0.1 preoperatively and 0.6±0.1 at the final follow-up in group 1, and 0.5±0.1 preoperatively and 0.4±0.2 at the final follow-up in group 2. Four patients underwent revision surgery in group 2 and 1 in group 1.
Conclusions: 
Although PVP treatment may be a useful method for cephalad vertebral fractures after instrumented lumbar fusion in elderly patients with persistent unremitting back pain, recollapse of the vertebral body can occur after a PVP for cephalad or adjacent vertebral fractures with an IVC.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To evaluate safety and effectiveness of performance of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with malignant compression fractures and involvement of the epidural space.
Materials and methods: 
PVP was performed in 50 patients with metastatic disease or multiple myeloma between June 1998 and April 2002. Twenty-five women (mean age, 62.3 years; range, 38-85 years) and 25 men (mean age, 63.1 years; range, 37-92 years) were included. Cases were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone cross-sectional imaging were classified into three groups. First group had no epidural involvement; second group, mild epidural involvement without contact with spinal cord or nerve roots; third group, moderate involvement and contact with spinal cord or nerve roots. Procedural safety was evaluated with review of all post-PVP complications and their treatment. Effectiveness was evaluated with follow-up phone calls for assessment of change in pain level and activity after PVP. Follow-up calls were performed at 1 day; 2 weeks; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 and 2 years. Differences between groups were assessed with singly ordered Kruskal-Wallis test.
Results: 
Fourteen patients were classified in the first group, 18 in the second, and 18 in the third. There were no significant differences in pain or mobility outcomes among groups. At the last follow-up call, 41 (82%) of 50 patients reported improvement in pre-PVP pain. Six (12%) reported no change, and three (6%) reported increased pain. After PVP in 26 (52%) patients, there was a period of increased mobility; in 19 (38%), no improvement in mobility occurred; and in five (10%), decreased mobility was reported. Complications included acute increased pain or new areas of pain in seven (14%) patients. None of these required surgery; four were treated with nerve root block; two, with central epidural injection; and one, with overnight intravenous steroids.
Conclusion: 
PVP can be performed safely and effectively with conscious sedation in patients with malignant compression fractures and epidural involvement.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Vertebroplasty (VP), including balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), has long been accepted as a minimally invasive surgical intervention for the stabilization of painful vertebral compression fractures. In metastatic compression fracture (MCF), cancer often invades the paravertebral structure and involves the posterior column of the vertebrae.
Purpose: 
In the present study, we first analyzed how clinical features of MCF affect functional outcomes after VP. Second, we evaluated whether BKP is more beneficial than simple VP (SVP) in MCF.
Study design::Setting: 
This is a retrospective observational study.
Patient sample: 
Three hundred forty-two patients who underwent VP for painful MCF from solid cancer were included. We excluded MCF from hematopoietic cancer, such as leukemia or multiple myeloma.
Outcome measures: 
Pain improvement was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS; range: 0-10), and if the VAS score decreased by at least three points the treatment was considered effective. Postoperative change in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and drug requirement for pain control were also measured as functional outcomes.
Methods: 
An institutional database at the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched to identify all patients who underwent VP for painful MCF between March 2002 and September 2013. Demographic data, as well as preoperative and postoperative clinical factors, were collected from patients' medical records. Radiological features, including paravertebral extension of tumors and the extent of three-column involvement, were reviewed from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). These clinical and radiological factors were then analyzed for their influence on functional outcomes.
Results: 
The mean preoperative VAS score was 5.8; this improved to a mean of 2.7 after VP. Effective improvement in VAS score (≥3) was achieved in 206 patients (60%). Patients with radiculopathy, as well as those with involvement of (1) the posterior column or (2) more than four out of six columns, presented with significantly higher pretreatment VAS scores and experienced more effective improvement after treatment (p<.05). Two hundred thirty-eight patients (70%) underwent SVP, whereas the remaining 104 patients underwent BKP. The pretreatment degree of compression was significantly higher in BKP (mean: 47%) than in SVP patients (mean: 30%) (p<.001). However, preoperative VAS scores were not significantly different between the two groups, and the resultant VAS score improvement was also not significantly different. Although BKP patients reported to have a greater chance of more than 3 mL of cement injection (p=.01), the mean amount of cement injected was not different between the two groups. Patients with other bone metastases showed a significantly poorer KPS improvement rate (p=.015). Patients having moderately or slowly growing cancer according to the Tomita classification had a greater chance of reduced drug requirements 1 month after the procedure (p=.004).
Conclusions: 
Paravertebral extension and posterior column involvement of MCF did not preclude pain improvement after VP. Balloon kyphoplasty for MCF failed to show enhanced pain improvement relative to SVP. Metastatic compression fracture patients with other bone metastases or rapidly growing tumors had a lower chance of performance improvement and reduced drug requirements, respectively.},

  abstract={We present the clinical and radiological results of percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of 58 vertebral compression fractures in 51 patients at a minimum follow-up of two years. Group 1 consisted of 39 patients, in whom there was no associated intravertebral cleft, whilst group 2 comprised 12 patients with an intravertebral cleft. The Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded prospectively. The radiological evidence of kyphotic deformity, vertebral height, leakage of cement and bone resorption around the cement were studied retrospectively, both before and after operation and at the final follow-up. The ODI and VAS scores in both groups decreased after treatment, but the mean score in group 2 was higher than that in group 1 (p = 0.02 (ODI), p = 0.02 (VAS)). There was a greater initial correction of the kyphosis in group 2 than in group 1, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, loss of correction was greater in group 2. Leakage of cement was seen in 24 (41.4%) of 58 vertebrae (group 1, 32.6% (15 of 46); group 2, 75% (9 of 12)), mainly of type B through the basal vertebral vein in group 1 and of type C through the cortical defect in group 2. Resorption of bone around the cement was seen in three vertebrae in group 2 and in one in group 1. There were seven adjacent vertebral fractures in group 1 and one in group 2. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures with or without an intravertebral cleft. Nonetheless, higher rates of complications related to the cement must be recognised in patients in the presence of an intravertebral cleft.},

Methods: 
We performed a prospective study consisting of 101 consecutive patients who underwent PV and 27 patients who refused PV treatment and were managed conservatively. We used a data evaluation and outcomes system that was developed to evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention.
Results: 
Patients that elected for PV as a treatment of their fractures had significantly more pain and functional impairment before the procedure than the patients of the conservative group (P < 0.001). The pain, functional, and general health scores of the PV group were improved from the preoperative mean values (P < 0.001) in all postoperative periods. Compared with the conservative treatment group, there was a significant difference at month 3. However, no statistical differences on function were observed between these groups at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment.
Conclusions: 
PV demonstrated a rapid and significant relief of pain and improved the quality of life. PV election for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fracture after 6 weeks of conservative treatment was based on pain and functional impairment.},

We performed PVP in 4 patients with generalized MG associated with recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs. Relief from pain was very rapid, usually within 24 h, and retained at a 3-month evaluation. No severe complication or MG worsening were observed in the post-operative period. Although clinical indication for PVP is still controversial, in our experience PVP is a useful and safe tool to be considered in the management of recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs in selected MG patients.},

To see the safety and efficacy of Percutaneous vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
This study was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery, Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) Karachi, Pakistan. Patients with osteoporotic compression vertebral fractures, not responding to conservative treatment and having localized overlying tenderness and MRI evidence of high signal in the involved vertebral body, were included in the study. Visual Analogue Scale was used to measure the intensity of pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was performed by injecting polymethylacrylate in the diseased vertebral body. The patients were followed up for initially 4 and 24 hours. Later they had a check up at 2 weeks, one three, six and twelve months.
Results: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty on twentyfour patients were included who underwent (LNH) from 2002 to 2006 Age range was from 65 to 85 years (mean age 75 +/- 3.3 years). Among 24 patients, 21 were females and 3 patients were male. Six patients had two levels osteoporotic compression vertebral fractures the rest, had compression at one level. Patients with radicular pain or signs of myelopathy, osteomyelitis of targeted vertebral body or overlying skin infection, severe compression of vertebral body or with retropulsed fragment into canal as evident by CT scan were excluded from the study. While patients who failed to respond to 6-12 weeks of conservative treatment, with localized overlying tenderness and MRI evident high signal in vertebral body involved, were included in the study. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied for the assessment of pain intensity. Followup was performed immediately, within 4 hours, after 24 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and finally at one year.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a safe and useful procedure for the treatment of backache associated with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To describe the technique of percutaneous vertebroplasty and the short-term results in patients with symptomatic, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Design: 
Prospective follow-up study.
Method: 
In a pilot-study to evaluate the short-term safety and effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty, 18 consecutive patients with a total of 33 osteoporotic thoracic or lumbar vertebral compression fractures were treated from October 2001 to June 2002 with a follow-up of 3-6 months. The indication for treatment was a symptomatic, therapy-resistant osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed under radiographic control, after previous intraossal venography, using bone cement mixed with barium sulphate. Post-procedural follow-up consisted of radiological evaluation with conventional thoracolumbar X-rays and MRI scans, and interviews of the patients.
Results: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty was technically successful in 31 of 33 vertebral fractures (94%), and in 16 of 18 patients (89%). One patient with extreme venous contrast leakage could not be treated. Sixteen patients had less or no pain after treatment. One patient retained thoracolumbar back pain after inadequate cementations and refused further treatment. None of the patients reported aggravation of symptoms following the procedure. Contrast leakage was absent in 18 vertebrae. In 8 vertebrae there was contrast leakage to paravertebral veins. In three of these cases the leakage was so severe that embolisation was performed, with success in one case. In 13 vertebrae, cement leakage to intervertebral and paravertebral spaces and pedicular cement spurs were seen, without clinical consequences. Immediately after the procedure and during follow-up there were no clinically relevant complications.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty was a technically feasible treatment in these patients with symptomatic, therapy-resistant, osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The first short-term results were comparable with results in the literature. A prospective randomised intervention study will be needed to compare percutaneous vertebroplasty with optimal conservative treatment.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To determine the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures as published in the scientific literature.
Design: 
Literature review.
Method: 
Medline and the Cochrane library were searched with the terms 'percutaneous vertebroplasty', 'vertebral compression fractures', 'osteoporotic' and 'osteoporosis'. Criteria for inclusion were: (a) the studies had to have been published in the period January 1985-August 2002, (b) the study population had to include at least 10 patients, (c) the patients had to have been treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty, and (d) the diagnosis had to have been 'osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture'.
Results: 
Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Pain relief was seen in 60%-100% of the patients within the first 24 hours and this result improved to 78-100% in the long term (maximum 4 years). The complications immediately after the procedure were related to cement leakages and were mostly of no clinical consequence. Serious complications such as pulmonary embolism were rare. In the long term, percutaneous vertebroplasty was associated with an increased risk of fractures in the adjacent vertebrae.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty seems to be effective and safe in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A prospective randomised intervention study has, however, not yet been performed. For the time being, percutaneous vertebroplasty should be reserved for carefully selected patients in whom conservative therapy has not produced results.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with or without intravertebral clefts by unilateral approach and the impact of intravertebral clefts on the effectiveness.
Methods: 
The clinical data of 65 patients who met the inclusion criteria of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were retrospectively analyzed. According to having intravertebral clefts or not, the patients were divided into 2 groups: cleft group (group A, n=25) and non-cleft group (group B, n=40). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, the level of fracture vertebrae, degree of damage, and interval of injury and operation between 2 groups (P > 0.05). All patients were given PVP procedure by unilateral approach. The operation time, the injected volume of bone cement, time to ambulate, complications, and adjacent vertebral re-fracture were recorded. The height of anterior and middle column and the posterior convex Cobb angle of injured spine were measured on the lateral X-ray film in standing position at preoperation and 1, 48 weeks after operation. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) system were used to evaluate the pain relief and improvement of daily activity function respectively at preoperation and 1, 4, and 48 weeks after operation.
Results: 
There was no significant difference in the operation time and time to ambulate between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The injected volume of bone cement in group B was significantly less than that in group A (t=1.833, P=0.034). Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in 6 patients (4 in group A and 2 in group B), in group A including 1 case of venous leakage, 2 cases of paravertebral leakage, and 1 case of intradiscal leakage; in group B including 2 cases of venous leakage. No symptomatic pulmonary embolism was observed. The vital sign was stable during operation and postoperatively. All patients were followed up 12-30 months (mean, 18.5 months). No re-fracture of the vertebrae occurred during the follow-up. The postoperative VAS score, ODI, the height of anterior and middle column, and the posterior convex Cobb angle of injured spine were improved significantly when compared with the preoperative ones in 2 groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between 2 groups at pre- and post-operation (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
PVP by unilateral approach is safty and efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compression fracture combined with intravertebral clefts. Intravertebral clefts have no significant impact on the effectiveness in the pain relief and function improvement.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
There is still debate over whether vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP) is superior for the treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials comparing VP with KP to reach a relatively conclusive answer.
Methods: 
We searched computerised databases comparing efficacy and safety of VP and KP in osteoporotic fractures. These trials reported pain relief (Visual Analogue Scale), disability (Oswestry disability score) and complications (i.e., cement leakage, incident fractures) as the primary outcome.
Results: 
Eight studies involving 848 patients were identified. The outcome showed that VP is more effective in the short-term (no more than seven days) pain relief. Kyphoplasty had a superior capability for intermediate-term (around three months) functional improvement. As for long-term pain relief and functional improvement, there is no significant difference between these two interventions. Consistently, both interventions have similar risk for subsequent fracture and cement leakage.
Conclusion: 
Thus considering the higher cost of the KP procedure, we recommend VP over KP for the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is commonly used in the management of osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures, although there is controversy on its superiority over conservative treatment. Here we compare pain and function in women with vertebral osteoporotic fractures who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty versus conservative treatment with a protocolized rehabilitation program.
Methods: 
A longitudinal and comparative prospective study was conducted. Women ≥ 60 years of age with a diagnosis of osteoporosis who had at least one vertebral thoracic or lumbar compression fracture were included and divided into two groups, conservative treatment or vertebroplasty. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to assess pain and function, respectively, as the outcome measures.
Results: 
We included 31 patients, 13 (42%) treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty and 18 (58%) with conservative treatment. Baseline clinical characteristics, bone densitometry and fracture data were similar in both groups. At baseline, VAS was 73.1 ± 28.36 in the vertebroplasty group and 68.6 ± 36.1 mm in the conservative treatment group (p = 0.632); at three months it was 33.11 ± 10.1 vs. 42 ± 22.21 mm (p = 0.111); and at 12 months, 32.3 ± 11.21 vs. 36.1 ± 12.36 mm (p = 0.821). The ODI at baseline was 83% in the vertebroplasty group vs. 85% for conservative management (p = 0.34); at three months, 36 vs. 39% (p = 0.36); and at 12 months, 29.38 vs. 28.33% (p = 0.66).
Conclusions: 
Treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty had no advantages over conservative treatment for pain and function in this group of women ≥ 60 years of age with osteoporosis.},

Sixty-five patients who could be followed up for more than 2 years with thoracic and lumbar spine osteoporotic compression fractures, between January 2005 and October 2010, were reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of management: group 1, non-operated group treated conservatively; group 2, operated group that underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. We assessed the clinical and radiological changes at postoperative and follow-up periods in both groups.The male-to-female ratio and mean age of the patients were 11:54 and 73.04 years (range, 50 - 90 years), respectively. The location and number of treated vertebrae were as follows: T4 = 1, T6 = 1, T7 = 3, T8 = 1, T9 = 2, T10 = 1, T11 = 8, T12 = 11, L1 = 17, L2 = 10, L3 = 6, L4 = 3, and L5 = 1. The mean T-score was -3.37. The overall VAS score and the VAS score until 6 months post-injury were statistically more improved in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively). Overall, the compression ratio was statistically more improved in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.05).Early pain control and restoration of the compressed vertebral body are the beneficial and real effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with thoracolumbar osteoporotic compression fractures.},

  abstract={Background: 
This meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and conservative treatment (CT) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Methods: 
The authors searched RCTs in electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Embase, Springer Link, Web of Knowledge, OVID and Google Scholar) in a timeframe from their establishment to Feb 2017. We also manually searched the reference lists of reports and reviews for possible relevant studies. Researches on PVP versus CT in OVCFs were selected in this meta-analysis. The quality of all studies was assessed and effective data were pooled for this meta-analysis. The outcomes were measured by pain relief (one week, one month, three months and six months), quality of life (RDQ, ED-5Q and QUALEFFO) and the rate of adjacent vertebral fracture. Publication bias assessment was also performed, respectively. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.1.
Results: 
13 reports (12 RCTs) with a total 1231 patients (623 in the PVP and 608 in the CT) met inclusion criteria. Patients were followed up for at least 2 weeks in all the studies. Statistical differences were found between pain relief (one week (MD 1.36, 95% CI (0.55, 2.17)), one month (MD 1.56, 95% CI (0.43, 2.70)) and six months (MD -1.59, 95% CI (-2.9, -0.27))) and QUALEFFO (MD -5.03 95%CI (-7.94, -2.12)). No statistical differences were found between pain relief (three months (MD -0.28, 95% CI (-1.46, 0.90))), RDQ (MD -0.59, 95% CI (-1.31, 0.13)), ED-5Q (MD 0.10, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.22)) and the rate of adjacent vertebral fracture (RR 1.21, 95% CI (0.89, 1.62)).
Conclusions: 
PVP is associated with higher pain relief than CT in the early period. Furthermore, PVP did not increase the rate of adjacent vertebral fracture. The results indicate that it is a safe and effective treatment for OVCFs. Because of some limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Additional studies are needed. Large, definitive RCTs are needed.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the appropriate ratio of liquid/powder and use of radiopaque agent in EH composite material for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP).
Methods: 
(1) EH composite material was divided into 6 groups. The material without contrast with the liquid/powder ratios 8:9, 8:8, and 8:7 was classifieds as groups I, II, and III; and the EH composite material with the liquid/powder ratios 8:9, 8:8, and 8:7 and with the addition of 20% barium sulfate by weight was classified as the groups IV, V, and VI. The curing temperature was measured. The bone cement of different groups was made into cylinders to be X-rayed to observe the opacity. Universal tester was used to examine the strength and stiffness. (2) The vertebrae (T8 approximately L5) were isolated from the cadaver of an elder female patient with osteoporosis. Universal tester was used to examine the strength and stiffness of the vertebral bodies (VBs). Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) model was made. PVP procedure was mimicked by puncturing through the bilateral pedicle of vertebral arch into the anterior 1/3 of the vertebral bodies and the EH composite materials of the groups II and V were injected into the VBs Then the temperatures of the geometric center (CT) and spinal canal posterior wall (PT) of the VBs were measured in a water bath with the temperature of 37 degrees C. Twenty-four hours later the vertebrae underwent X-ray examination to observe the opacity and underwent examination of strength and stiffness with universal tester.
Results: 
(1) The sticking periods (?) of the groups IV, V, and VI were significantly longer than those of the corresponding groups I, II, and III respectively by about 60 s, and the highest temperature of the groups IV, V, and VI were significantly lower than those of the corresponding groups I, II, and III respectively. Addition1 of barium sulfate increased the opacity of the bone cement, but did nor significantly influence the strength of the bone cement. The properties of the group V was the best. (2) The bone cement was easy to be injected into the VBs. The peak PT was not beyond 50 degrees C. After the injection of the bone cement of the groups II, the strength and stiffness of the VB were (1501.6 +/- 5.0) N/mm and (285.6 +/-) N/mm, both significantly higher than those before the injection [(547.5 +/- 3.1) N/mm and (104.1 +/- 1.3) N/mm]; and after the injection of the bone cement of the groups V, the strength and stiffness of the VB were (1355.0 +/- 4.5) N/mm and (257.7 +/- 1.9), both significantly higher than those before the injection [(543.8 +/- 2.7) N/mm and (103.4 +/- 1.1) N/mm]. The opacity of the VBs injected with the bone cement of the group V was better than those injected with the bone cement of the group II.
Conclusion: 
The EH (8/8) with 20% barium sulfate is a proper and effective filling material for the treatment of OVCF.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A prospective review was done of a new intraoperative technique developed to detect and prevent neurologic compromise during pedicle screw insertion.
Objectives: 
To describe in sufficient detail the technique of persistently electrified pedicle stimulation instruments, so that this technique will be available generally to all clinical neurophysiologists and spine surgeons; and to demonstrate the use, typical results, interpretation, and protocol of the technique.
Summary and background data: 
Fusion techniques that use pedicle instrumentation have the potential to cause nerve root injury. Several authors have proposed imaging and neurophysiologic methods to improve outcome. The present method represents a significant theoretical departure and advance from previously reported methods.
Methods: 
All relevant instruments used during pedicle instrumentation were converted easily, inexpensively, and quickly into monopolar stimulators with appropriate stimulus voltages to identify broaches of pedicle bone via evoked-electromyograms from relevant muscle groups.
Results: 
The persistently electrified pedicle stimulation instrument technique provided accurate intraoperative neurophysiologic information concerning pedicle, integrity in the patients studied. The protocol is standardized and adaptable easily, inexpensively, and quickly to most clinical applications.
Conclusions: 
The persistently electrified pedicle stimulation instrument technique described here is useful for monitoring instrumented lumbar fusion procedures. The use of this protocol may help confirm intraosseous placement of pedicle screws and prevent neurologic injury.},

  abstract={There have been few clinical studies in the area of cervical spine that focused on surgery for treating degenerative lumbar disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). High rates of wound complications and instrumentation failure have been reported more for RA than for non-RA patients, although clinical outcomes are similar between the two groups. Lumbar canal stenosis in RA is caused not only by degeneration but also by RA-related spondylitis, which includes facet arthritis and inflammation around the vertebral endplate. The pitfalls in surgical management of lumbar canal stenosis in RA patients are highlighted in this study. The study reviewed 12 patients with RA, who were surgically treated for lumbar canal stenosis. Two out of five patients with pulmonary fibrosis died of worsened pulmonary condition, even though there were no perioperative pulmonary complications. Two patients with pedicle screw fixation showed no instrumentation failure, but two patients with spinous process fixation needed re-operation or vertebral fracture. Surgical treatment for lumbar canal stenosis in RA patients needs to be individually adjusted. Preoperative assessments and treatments of pulmonary fibrosis and osteopenia are essential. Surgery for lumbar canal stenosis with RA should be deferred for patients with advanced pulmonary fibrosis because of its potential life-threatening risk. Fusion surgery is indicated only in patients with kyphosis or severe symptoms caused by intervertebral instability. Pedicle screw fixation with hydroxyapatite granules or sublaminar tape is recommended. Closer follow-up after surgery is necessary because of possible delayed wound infection, instrumentation failure, pathological fracture, and respiratory deterioration.},

  abstract={Background: 
Pedicle screw pullout due to poor bone quality, mainly caused by osteoporosis, is a common problem in spine surgery. Special implants and techniques, especially PMMA augmentation, were developed to improve the fixation of pedicle screws. PMMA injection into a pilot hole or through a screw involves the same risks as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, regardless of the technique used. Especially when using fully cannulated screws anterior leakage is possible.
Objective: 
To prove PMMA injection is safe and possible without leakage through an incompletely cannulated screw and also increases pullout forces in the osteoporotic vertebra.
Methods: 
Incompletely cannulated pedicle screws were tested by axial pullout in human cadavers, divided into osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups. Non-augmented and PMMA-augmented pedicle screws were compared. Twenty-five human vertebrae were measured by DEXA and divided into osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups. In each vertebra both pedicles were instrumented with the new screw (WSI-Expertise 6×45 mm, Peter Brehm Inc. Germany); the right screw was augmented with a 3 mL PMMA injection through the screw. On each screw axial pullout was performed after X-ray and CT scan.
Results: 
Radiographs and CT scans excluded PMMA leakage. Cement was distributed in the middle and posterior third of the vertebrae. Pullout forces were significantly higher after pedicle screw augmentation, especially in the osteoporotic bone. All augmented pedicle screws showed higher pullout forces compared with the unaugmented screws.
Conclusions: 
We minimized the risk of leakage by using a screw with a closed tip. On the whole, PMMA augmentation through an incompletely cannulated pedicle screw is safe and increases pullout forces in osteoporotic bone to the level of healthy bone. Therefore the new incompletely cannulated screw can be used for pedicle screw augmentation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the correlation between the kyphosis angle of injured vertebral body and the risk of upper adjacent vertebral fracture after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using an osteoporotic vertebral compressed fracture model.
Materials and methods: 
24 functional spinal units (FSUs, T9 to L4) were selected from 6 elderly formalin preserved vertebral specimens to build the vertebral compressed fracture model. According to the kyphosis angle between the upper plate of upper vertebral body and the horizontal plane, group A (0°) and group B (20°) were defined, with each group comprised with 12 FSUs. The stiffness and fracture load were measured in both groups.
Results: 
After PKP, the stiffness was (571.513 ± 83.373)N/mm and the fracture load was (1751.659 ± 112.291)N in group A, with both significantly higher than those of group B (stiffness, (307.706 ± 46.723)N/mm; fracture load, (1128.011 ± 125.417)N).
Conclusions: 
To reduce the risk of upper adjacent vertebral fracture, it is better to restore the height of injured vertebral body and decrease the angle of kyphosis to increase the capability of upper adjacent vertebral body against fracture.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The proposed the thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) for thoracolumbar injury cites the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC). However, no report has elucidated the severity of damage in thoracic and lumbar injury with classification schemes by presence of the PLC injury. The purpose of this study was to accurately assess the severity of damage in thoracic and lumbar burst fractures with the PLC injuries.
Materials and methods: 
One hundred consecutive patients treated surgically for thoracic and lumbar burst fractures were enrolled in this study. There were 71 men and 29 women whose mean age was 36 years. Clinical and radiologic data were investigated, and the thoracolumbar injury classification schemes were also evaluated. All patients were divided into two groups (the P group with PLC injuries and the C group without PLC injuries) for comparative examination.
Results: 
Fourth-one of 100 cases showed PLC injuries in MRI study. The load sharing classification score was significantly higher in the P group [7.8±0.2 points for the P group and 6.9±1.1 points for the C group (p<0.001)]. The TLICS (excluded PLC score) score was also significantly higher in the P group [6.2±1.1 points for the P group and 4.0±1.4 points for the C group (p<0.001)].
Conclusion: 
The presence of PLC injury significantly influenced the severity of damage. In management of thoracic lumbar burst fractures, evaluation of PLC injury is important to accurately assess the severity of damage.},

  abstract={Background: 
Multisegmental cervical instrumentations ending at the cervicothoracic junction may lead to significant adjacent segment degeneration. The purpose of this study was to compare the extent of sequential pathologies in the lower adjacent segment between patient groups with a primarily cervical instrumentation ending at C7 versus an instrumentation including the cervicothoracic junction ending at T1 or T2.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis of 98 consecutive patients with multisegmental posterior cervical fusion surgery ending either at C7 or at T1 or T2 was performed. Radiographic parameters of degeneration at the adjacent segment below the instrumentation were determined postoperatively and at follow-up (FU), and the need for secondary interventions was documented.
Results: 
A total of 74 patients had a FU of at least 6 months (C7: n = 58, age 63 ± 11 years, FU 36 ± 26 months; T1/T2: n = 16, age 65 ± 13 years, FU 37 ± 21 months). There were no significant differences between the C7 and T1/T2 groups with regard to the change in kyphosis angle (P = 0.162), disc height (P = 0.204), or disc degeneration according to the Mimura grading system (P = 0.718). Secondary interventions due to adjacent segmental pathology or implant failure were necessary in 18 of 58 (31%) of the C7 cases and in 1 of 16 (6.3%) of the T1/T2 cases (P = 0.038).
Conclusions: 
Patients with multisegmental posterior cervical fusions ending at C7 showed a greater rate of clinically symptomatic pathologies at the adjacent level below the instrumentation. On the basis of our data and with its limitations in mind, one may consider to bridge the cervicothoracic junction and to end the instrumentation at T1 or T2 in those cases.},

  abstract={Background: 
The most common site of fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the cervical spine, especially the lower cervical spine and cervicothoracic junction. The optimal treatment for cervical spine fractures secondary to AS is controversial. This study aimed to explore the effects of posterior pedicle screw fixation alone on fractures of the lower cervical spine in patients with AS.
Methods: 
From January 2006 to January 2013, a total of 35 patients with AS and a lower cervical spine fracture were treated using only posterior cervical/thoracic pedicle screw fixation. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the patients' charts to assess their case histories, operations, neurological outcomes, and complications. We also evaluated their postoperative radiographs to determine the time of bone fusion.
Results: 
Altogether, 32 (91.4%) of the 35 fractures resulted from an acute injury and 3 (8.6%) from a chronic injury. In 25 cases, the fracture resulted from a low-energy spinal injury and in 8 cases from a high-energy injury. Posterior pedicle screw fixation was successful in all patients, with radiographic fusion confirmed by computed tomography. The average time of bone fusion was 3.6 months (range 3 - 6 months). The surgery improved the American Spinal Injury Association grade in 15 (42.9%) patients. No intraoperative complications occurred. None of the corrections resulted in neurological decompensation. The average postoperative correction was 18°.
Conclusions: 
Pedicle screw fixation and autologous bone grafting through a single posterior approach to lower cervical spine fractures in AS patients could stabilize the spine, correct kyphosis, and relieve pressure. It is thus reasonable to recommend this surgical strategy for AS-associated fractures of the lower cervical spine.

  abstract={Object: 
The association of posterior ring apophysis separation (PRAS) with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is uncommon and represents a true subgroup of disc herniation mainly seen in the adolescent population. The objective of this study was to describe a decade of experience in the care of adult patients with PRAS with LDH, giving particular attention to its diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcome.
Methods: 
This retrospective study focuses on a case series of adult patients with PRAS associated with LDH who underwent surgery for lumbar disc disease in the author's neurosurgical department between 1999 and 2008. Posterior ring apophysis separation was diagnosed in 87 (5.35%) of 1625 patients surgically treated for LDH; these patients made up the PRAS group. During a 6-month period in 2005, LDH without PRAS was diagnosed in 89 consecutive patients at the same facility; these patients constituted the control group. Presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, and preoperative imaging results were obtained from medical records. Immediate operative results were assessed, as were complications, long-term outcome, and the need for repeat surgery.
Results: 
This study is the first to document the distinguishing features between adult patients with and those without PRAS. The difference in average age was statistically significant (p < 0.001) between the study group (36.22 years) and the control group (44.30 years), as was the incidence of male patients (86.20% vs 71.91%, p = 0.020), incidence of military patients (74.71% vs 57.30%, p = 0.015), average duration of symptoms (16.13 vs 8.4 months, p = 0.016), and incidence of reactive scoliosis (19.54% vs 4.49%, p = 0.002). The most common anatomical location of disc herniation in the PRAS group was L5-S1 (51.72%) versus L4-L5 (53.93%) in the control group (p = 0.017). In terms of previous injury, motor deficits, back and/or leg pain, lateral or central location of LDH, mean anteroposterior diameter of disc herniation, hard or soft discs, and surgical complications, there was no statistical difference between the 2 patient groups. Similarly, there was no difference in recurrence rates and clinical outcomes between the patients with or without PRAS.
Conclusions: 
Posterior ring apophysis separation with LDH is probably more common in adults than is generally recognized. It must be suspected when young male patients with persistent sciatic scoliosis and no history of injury show signs of calcified LDH. Computed tomography scanning with sagittal reconstructions is the procedure of choice for diagnosing. The L5-S1 intervertebral disc level is most commonly affected, especially the superior endplate of S-1. This condition needs more extensive surgical exposure and resection to relieve the nerve impingement. The occurrence of an apophyseal lesion was not associated with recurrent disc herniation or a fair outcome.},

  abstract={Aim: 
Posterior cervical spine fixation has undergone tremendous advancement in recent years. The purpose of this study is to present our experience with the Roy-Camille instrumentation for posterior cervical stabilization after injury in a long-term follow-up.
Patients and methods: 
From 1985 to 1995, 76 patients with a lower cervical spine traumatic lesion were treated in a single institution by posterior plate stabilization using the Roy-Camille plates (R-C plates). Fifty-four men and 22 women with a mean age of 43.2 years were involved. In 59 patients the injuries were due to a road traffic accident, in 14 cases the fall from a high was responsible, while in two cases the injuries were due to sport activities. There were four bilateral dislocations, nine unilateral dislocations, 56 fracture dislocations, five fracture separations of a lateral mass and two burst fractures. Neurological lesions were present in 65 patients (9 ASIA A, 16 ASIA B, 22 ASIA C, 18 ASIA D and 11 ASIA E). All patients had minimum follow-up of 7 years. Fifty-nine patients were followed up for a mean period of 21 years (14-27 years).
Results: 
Stability was obtained in all but two cases. Reoperation was done in two cases: in one for the correction of the lost reduction and in a second for the reinsertion of a screw irritating a nerve root. No case in the ASIA A group showed neurological improvement, a fact observed in the other groups.
Conclusions: 
The R-C plates were used in the last quarter of the last century. This technique showed good short-time results, and we have shown good results in a long-term follow-up as well. The literature referred to this technique was favorable, as far as the biomechanical behavior and also clinical application concern. The question about this plating system abundance still remains unanswered.},

To evaluate differences in radiologic and functional outcomes between C1-C2 posterior temporary fixation (PTF) and cephalocervicothoracic cast fixation for type III odontoid fractures.
Methods: 
Data from 13 patients who underwent PTF and 13 cases who underwent cephalocervicothoracic cast fixation due to fresh type III odontoid fractures were reviewed retrospectively. All patients with fracture healing underwent a functional computed tomography scan at the final follow-up to evaluate the range of motion in C1-C2 rotation. Functional outcomes were evaluated in the form of visual analog scale for neck pain, neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and Neck Disability Index. The outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
Results: 
At the final follow up, all 26 patients achieved healing of their fractures. There were no complications associated with either treatment. The left-to-right ranges of motion of C1-C2 rotation were 41.9° ± 11.9° in the PTF group and 43.5° ± 12.0° in the cephalocervicothoracic cast fixation group. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups regarding the C1-C2 rotation angle (P > 0.05). There also were no significant differences between 2 groups in functional outcomes evaluated by visual analog scale for neck pain, neck stiffness, Neck Disability Index, and patient satisfaction (all P > 0.05).
Conclusions: 
The outcomes of PTF and cephalocervicothoracic cast fixation were comparable in the treatment of type III odontoid fractures. For type III odontoid fractures that cannot be managed by nonoperative fixation or anterior screw fixation, PTF may be the treatment of choice, because it spares the motion of the C1-C2 complex.},

Case report.
Objective: 
To describe a new method to treat septic pseudarthrosis of the lumbar spine via a transcanal approach.
Summary of background data: 
Septic pseudarthrosis of the spine after multiple unsuccessful anterior and posterior surgeries for vertebral fracture represents a challenge for spine surgeons.
Methods: 
Septic pseudarthrosis associated with dorsal fistula developed in a 40-year-old paraplegic man after unsuccessful combined anterior and posterior instrumentation for L3-burst fracture and sagittal sitting imbalance caused by collapsing spine.
Results: 
The instrumentation was removed together with meticulous pseudarthrosis debridement, fistula excision, and intravenous antibiotics plus continuous irrigation. Three months later, the pseudarthrosis area was approached via a posterior transcanal route because of the preceding multiple anterior transperitoneal and retroperitoneal surgeries. Posterior interbody instrumentation and fusion were performed with titanium mesh cages filled with autologous iliac bone graft. Pedicle screw-rod instrumentation was additionally applied to reinforce the interbody fusion and restore lumbar lordosis. Following this operation, the patient was ambulated with a custom made plastic jacket in his wheelchair. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient regained his sitting ability progressively. Four months later, the blood count analysis was within normal limits. Radiologically, there was a complete fusion at the level of instrumentation, while the preoperative lost lumbar lordosis was sufficiently restored. The patient was reemployed 6 months after surgery in his previous work in a sitting position, and, during the last observation 4 years later, he had normal labor analysis and lumbar lordosis.
Conclusion: 
This extremely rare case focuses on the use of the transcanal approach to treat adequately lumbar septic pseudarthrosis and restore lumbar lordosis in definitively paraplegic patients in whom no anterior approach can be used.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The aim of this study was to explore the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after a lateral screw was combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw for a type II odontoid fracture and hopefully provide references in decision making and surgical planning for spinal surgeons.
Methods: 
This is a retrospective study. By retrieving the medical records from January 2010 to July 2015 in our hospital, 117 type II odontoid fracture patients were reviewed. According to the occurrence of fracture union at the final follow-up, patients were divided into 2 groups: union and nonunion. To investigate the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion, 3 categorized factors were analyzed statistically: patient characteristics-age, sex, body mass index, preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, duration, comorbidity, and complicated injuries; surgical variables-surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2; radiographic parameters-preoperative and immediate postoperative data of C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, C7 slope, fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, and the separation and displacement of the odontoid fracture. Other variables including JOA and visual analog scale scores for neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up were recorded and compared between the 2 groups.
Results: 
Postoperative fracture nonunion was detected in 76 of 117 patients (65%) at final follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in patient characteristics of sex, body mass index, JOA score, comorbidity, and complicated injuries. The mean age at operation was younger in the union group than in the nonunion group, and the mean duration was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. There was no difference in surgical variables of surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2. There was no difference in radiographic parameters of fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, preoperative and immediate postoperative C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 SVA, and C7 slope. No difference was found in preoperative and immediate postoperative displacement of the odontoid fracture or immediate postoperative separation of the odontoid fracture, while the preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced age (>45 years), long duration (>2 months), and preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture (>4 mm) were independently associated with the postoperative fracture nonunion. There were no differences between the 2 groups in JOA, neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Advanced age, long duration, and preoperative separation of odontoid fracture >4 mm are predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after posterior C1 lateral screw combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture. Our findings did not demonstrate any evidence of lower functional outcome and patients satisfaction for those patients who had odontoid nonunion.},

  abstract={Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures for the treatment of fresh vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) associated with osteoporosis, trauma, malignant conditions, hemangiomas, and osteonecrosis. During these procedures, bone cement (e.g., polymethylmethacrylate) is percutaneously injected into the vertebral body. Systematic reviews of both procedures have shown significantly improved back pain and quality of life compared to conservative therapy. Direct comparison between VP and KP is not possible because of the lack of prospective randomized data comparing the two procedures. Both appear to improve patient functional status in most studies, although it is difficult to pool the available data because of differing measurement scales. With increasing popularity of both techniques, particularly over the past ten years, a rising number of publications have detailed potential complications secondary to cement extravasation, from compression of neural elements to venous embolism. Overall complication rates for both procedures are low. Systematic reviews have found significantly higher rates of cement leakage after VP (40%) versus KP (8%), with 3% of VP leaks being symptomatic. The evidence for increased risk of adjacent level fracture after these procedures compared to conservative treatment is inconclusive. When performed by a well-trained practitioner in appropriately selected patients, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both safe and effective treatments for fresh vertebral compression fractures. Results from ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further detailed information about both procedures in the future.},

  abstract={Fractured vertebral bodies are often stabilized by vertebroplasty. Several parameters, including fracture type, cement filling shape, cement volume, elastic moduli of cement, cancellous bone and fractured region, may all affect the stresses in the augmented vertebral body and in bone cement. The aim of this study was to determine numerically the effects of these input parameters on the stresses caused. In a probabilistic finite element study, an osteoligamentous model of the lumbar spine was employed. Seven input parameters were simultaneously and randomly varied within appropriate limits for >110 combinations thereof. The maximum von Mises stresses in cancellous and cortical bone of the treated vertebral body L3 and in bone cement were calculated. The loading cases standing, flexion, extension, lateral bending, axial rotation and walking were simulated. In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, the coefficients of correlation and determination of the input parameters on the von Mises stresses were calculated. The loading case has a strong influence on the maximum von Mises stress. In cancellous bone, the median value of the maximum von Mises stresses for the different input parameter combinations varied between 1.5 (standing) and 4.5 MPa (flexion). The ranges of the stresses are large for all loading cases studied. Depending on the loading case, up to 69% of the maximum stress variation could be explained by the seven input parameters. The fracture shape and the elastic modulus of the fractured region have the highest influence. In cortical bone, the median values of the maximum von Mises stresses varied between 31.1 (standing) and 61.8 MPa (flexion). The seven input parameters could explain up to 80% of the stress variation here. It is the fracture shape, which has always the highest influence on the stress variation. In bone cement, the median value of the maximum von Mises stresses varied between 3.8 (standing) and 12.7 MPa (flexion). Up to 75% of the maximum stress variation in cement could be explained by the seven input parameters. Fracture shape, and the elastic moduli of bone cement and of the fracture region are those input parameters with the highest influence on the stress variation. In the model with no fracture, the maximum von Mises stresses are generally low. The present probabilistic and sensitivity study clearly showed that in vertebroplasty the maximum stresses in the augmented vertebral body and in bone cement depend mainly on the loading case and fracture shape. Elastic moduli of cement, fracture region and cancellous bone as well as cement volume have sometimes a moderate effect while number and symmetry of cement plugs have virtually no effect on the maximum stresses.},

  abstract={Sacral fractures are rare injuries that are often neglected because of the general severity of the patient's injuries. They are typical injuries in patients with polytraumata. A "hidden" injury, they are often diagnosed late or are even missed. In a well-documented consecutive series of 1,350 patients with pelvic fractures treated in the trauma department of the Hannover Medical School between 1972 and 1991, a total of 377 sacrum fractures were evaluated in a retrospective study. The cause of the accident, mechanism of injury, concomitant injuries, diagnostic procedures, classification of the pelvic injury (TILE), as well as the classification of the sacrum injury (DENIS), treatment and outcome were analyzed in all cases. Observed complications with special attention to injuries to the lumbosacral plexus were correlated with the classification of the sacrum and pelvis, as well as with a detailed analysis of the fracture pattern and fracture characteristics. In 89.4% at least one additional body region was injured in these patients. PTS (Hannover Polytrauma Score) groups III and IV included 42.5% of the patients. With an improved diagnostic protocol (radiological a.p. views, oblique views and CT scan), the observed rate of sacrum fractures was 33%. Neurological deficits occurred in 15.1% of the patients. In contrast to the literature, the rate of neurological deficits was related more to the degree of pelvic instability (TILE) than to the specific fracture pattern in the sacrum. In stable injuries (TILE A) neurological deficits were only seen in exceptions. In type B injuries the maximum rate was 10%, whereas in unstable fractures (TILE C) the rate of neurological deficits was 32.6% in transalar fractures (DENIS zone I), 42.9% in transforaminal fractures (DENIS zone II), and 63.6% in central fracture types (DENIS zone III). Additional risk indicators for neurological impairment are avulsion fractures of the sacrum, comminuted and bilateral fracture lines. The fracture classification should thus be modified. Our own experience with operative therapy for sacral fractures (open revision of the sacral plexus together with internal stabilization of the fracture) is still limited, but based on the experience presented, further development of the treatment protocol for sacrum fractures should be considered.},

Materials and methods: 
Sixty-one patients who were first diagnosed with SCLC with bone metastases at our institution were included in this retrospective analysis.
Results: 
The overall survival (OS) of patients with bone metastases was shorter than that of patients without bone metastases (4.13 vs. 6.17 months, p = 0.015). Poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS; ≥2) and higher serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP; above upper normal limit × 2) were independent poor prognostic factors (p = 0.027 for ECOG PS, p = 0.002 for ALP). More than 1 SRE occurred in 21 patients (34.4%). Cervical spine metastasis, thoracic spine metastasis, pelvic bone metastasis, more than 5 bone metastatic regions and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase were correlated with the occurrence of SREs. Thoracic spinal metastasis was a strong predictive factor for the occurrence of SREs (odds ratio = 5.475; 95% CI: 1.080-27.755).
Conclusion: 
Our study demonstrates the poor prognosis of SCLC patients with bone metastases. Physicians should treat SCLC patients with bone metastases with caution.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE This study investigated the benefit of prophylactic vertebroplasty of the adjacent vertebrae in single-segment osteoporotic vertebral body fractures treated with kyphoplasty. METHODS All patients treated with kyphoplasty for osteoporotic single-segment fractures between January 2007 and August 2012 were included in this retrospective study. The patients received either kyphoplasty alone (kyphoplasty group) or kyphoplasty with additional vertebroplasty of the adjacent segment (vertebroplasty group). The segmental kyphosis with the rate of adjacent-segment fractures (ASFs) and remote fractures were studied on plain lateral radiographs preoperatively, postoperatively, at 3 months, and at final follow-up. RESULTS Thirty-seven (82%) of a possible 45 patients were included for the analysis, with a mean follow-up of 16 months (range 3-54 months). The study population included 31 women, and the mean age of the total patient population was 72 years old (range 53-86 years). In 21 patients (57%), the fracture was in the thoracolumbar junction. Eighteen patients were treated with additional vertebroplasty and 19 with kyphoplasty only. The segmental kyphosis increased in both groups at final follow-up. A fracture through the primary treated vertebra (kyphoplasty) was found in 4 (22%) of the vertebroplasty group and in 3 (16%) of the kyphoplasty group (p = 0.6). An ASF was found in 50% (n = 9) of the vertebroplasty group and in 16% (n = 3) of the kyphoplasty group (p = 0.03). Remote fractures occurred in 1 patient in each group (p = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic vertebroplasty of the adjacent vertebra in patients with single-segment osteoporotic fractures as performed in this study did not decrease the rate of adjacent fractures. Based on these retrospective data, the possible benefits of prophylactic vertebroplasty do not compensate for the possible risks of an additional cement augmentation.},

We prospectively followed 167 patients who received 207 vertebroplasty treatment sessions for stabilization of 264 symptomatic vertebral compression fractures between August 1999 and January 2003. The average age of patients was 74.6 years (SD = 12.2 years), and 76% were women. Pre- and postprocedural measurements of pain, mobility, analgesic use, and SF-36 scales were compared at 1 month after the procedure and between 6 months and 3 years after the procedure with the SF-36 scales.
Results: 
Respective pre- and post-treatment pain scores were 8.71 (SE = 0.1) and 2.77 (SE = 0.18; P < .00001). Respective pre- and post-treatment analgesic use scores were 2.93 (SE = 0.9) and 1.64 (SE = 0.09; P < .00001). Respective pre- and post-treatment activity levels were 2.66 (SE = 0.1) and 1.64 (SE = 0.11; P < .00001). There was a statistically significant improvement on nine of 10 SF-36 scales (P < .001) after 1 month and on eight of 10 SF-36 scales (P < .02) at long-term follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty offers statistically significant benefits in decreasing pain, decreasing use of analgesics, and increasing mobility in appropriately selected patients. Percutaneous vertebroplasty also offers a statistically significant benefit in most SF-36 scales at both short- and long-term follow-up.},

Between 2004 and 2009, two groups of 55 patients each underwent vertebral dilator kyphoplasty and balloon kyphoplasty, respectively. Pain, function, the Cobb angle, and the anterior and middle height of the vertebral body were assessed before and after operation. Leakage of bone cement was recorded. The post-operative change in the Cobb angle was significantly greater in the dilator kyphoplasty group than in the balloon kyphoplasty group (-9.51 degrees (sd 2.56) vs -7.78 degrees (sd 1.19), p < 0.001)). Leakage of cement was less in the dilator kyphoplasty group. No other significant differences were found in the two groups after operation, and both procedures gave equally satisfactory results in terms of all other variables assessed. No serious complications occurred in either group. These findings suggest that vertebral dilator kyphoplasty can facilitate better correction of kyphotic deformity and may ultimately be a safer procedure in reducing leakage of bone cement.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
Most post-vertebroplasty new-onset adjacent vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) occur within 2-3 months, and antiresorptive agents do not significantly reduce the risk of their occurrence. In opposite mechanism, teriparatide directly stimulates bone formation and improves bone strength and quality faster. The therapeutic effect of teriparatide is better than that of vertebroplasty combined with an antiresorptive treatment and is a potentially useful therapy for new-onset adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty.
Introduction: 
Following vertebroplasty, patients are at increased risk of new-onset adjacent-level VCFs. The therapeutic effect of antiresorptive agents is too slow, and they are associated with the risk of new VCFs. Teriparatide markedly increases bone formation and strength and reduces the incidence of new-onset VCFs. This prospective cohort study compared the therapeutic effects of teriparatide with those of combined vertebroplasty and an anti-resorber for treating new-onset adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty.
Methods: 
Fifty patients with adjacent VCFs were randomly assigned to two groups: teriparatide only (group A) and additional vertebroplasty combined with an antiresorptive agent (group B). Relevant clinical data of the two groups were prospectively compared.
Results: 
The 22 patients in group A were at higher risk of new VCFs than those in group B (22 patients); they were older and had more pre-existing fractures (p < 0.05). Patients treated with teriparatide had a significantly lower incidence of new-onset VCFs (odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-2.10). Teriparatide-mediated VCF reduction was 78.57%, which was markedly better than that of group B. The teriparatide group had a significant decrease in the visual analog scale and an increase in the Japanese Orthopedic Association low back pain score after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.05). The increase in lumbar spine BMD was marked in the teriparatide group (21.70% vs. 6.87%) after an 18-month treatment.
Conclusions: 
Treatment of post-vertebroplasty adjacent VCFs with teriparatide (no new vertebroplasty) was more effective than that of repeated vertebroplasties combined with an anti-resorber.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Randomized, controlled, prospective (AAOS therapeutic level I) trial conducted under Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption hypothesized noninferiority of a novel bioactive composite material to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
Objective: 
To determine the safety and efficacy of a new, nonresorbable bioactive composite (Cortoss) compared with PMMA, the standard treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty with PMMA, the widely adopted treatment for VCFs nonresponsive to conservative care, provides effective, immediate pain relief, but the material has received criticism for its properties. A new bioactive composite material designed specifically for vertebroplasty showed promising results in animals and nonrandomized clinical studies and was subsequently compared with PMMA in a randomized study. This study represents the first prospective study evaluating vertebroplasty comparing PMMA with another material with 24-month follow-up.
Methods: 
Using 2:1 randomization, vertebroplasty was performed with Cortoss on 162 patients and PMMA on 94 patients. Inclusion criteria were painful osteoporotic VCFs with a visual analogue scale pain score of at least 50 mm on a 100-mm scale and at least 30% disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. Evaluations at pretreatment, treatment day, and 7 posttreatment intervals out to 24 months included pain, disability, neurological status, adverse events, quality of life, patient satisfaction, analgesic use, and independently reviewed radiographs.
Results: 
Noninferiority of Cortoss relative to PMMA was observed, with Cortoss-treated patients experiencing significant pain relief at 3 months (P = 0.0395) and better maintenance or improvement in function at 24 months (P = 0.0299). Incidence of serious device-related adverse events was 4.3% in both groups; none were life threatening.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty using either Cortoss or PMMA provides effective, immediate, and lasting pain relief and prevents further loss of function. Both materials performed comparably at most time points; Cortoss demonstrated better results for pain reduction at 3 months and for function at 24 months.},

A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To investigate the morphologic features of proximal vertebral fractures in adults following spinal deformity surgery using segmental pedicle screw instrumentation.
Summary of background data: 
Fractures above pedicle screw constructs are a clinical problem that warrants further investigation for prevention and treatment.
Methods: 
Ten adult patients (6 lumbar scoliosis, 4 degenerative sagittal imbalance) who underwent segmental spinal instrumented fusion were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the features of vertebral fracture: upper instrumented vertebral collapse + adjacent vertebral subluxation (SUB group: n = 5), and adjacent vertebral fracture (Fracture group: n = 5).
Results: 
Both groups demonstrated a high frequency of osteopenia and all patients in the SUB group had comorbidities before surgery. The SUB group demonstrated a shorter interval between initial surgery and the fracture (subluxation: 3 +/- 1.9 months; fracture: 33 +/- 25.3 months, P < 0.05), and hypokyphosis (T5-T12) in the thoracic region before surgery (SUB: 13 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees; fracture: 33 degrees +/- 15.6 degrees). Both groups demonstrated severe global sagittal imbalance (SUB: 151 +/- 62.8 mm; fracture: 94 +/- 102.2 mm), and hypolordosis (T12-S1) in the lumbar spine (SUB: -19 degrees +/- 24.4 degrees ; fracture: -33 degrees +/- 22.7 degrees) before surgery. Global sagittal imbalance in the SUB group was corrected to 8 +/- 17.4 mm immediately postoperative (P < 0.05), but increased to 64 +/- 19.9 mm after the junctional fractures (P < 0.05). The SUB group demonstrated a significantly higher wedging rate (SUB: 65% +/- 12.4%; fracture: 36% +/- 16.0%, P < 0.05) and greater local kyphosis (SUB: 42 degrees +/- 11.1 degrees; fracture: 17 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, P < 0.05) after the fracture. Two of 5 patients in the SUB group demonstrated severe neurologic deficit from E to B after the fractures by a modified Frankel classification.
Conclusion: 
Old age, osteopenia, preoperative comorbidities, and severe global sagittal imbalance were found to be frequent in patients with proximal junctional fracture. In addition, marked correction of sagittal malalignment might be considered as a risk factor of upper instrumented vertebra collapse followed by adjacent vertebral subluxation, which occurred in the first 6 months after corrective surgery with the potential for causing severe neurologic deficit because of the severe local kyphotic deformity.},

To describe an unusual case of PVO showing atypical radiological change and call attention to this condition so that others may avoid this diagnostic pitfall.
Setting: 
Japan.
Methods: 
A 62-year-old diabetic woman with suspected T12 pathological fracture of malignant spinal tumor and neurological involvement received urgent anterior decompression and spinal reconstruction without biopsy.
Results: 
Anterior decompression and spinal reconstruction was performed, but histological examination of the specimen after surgery unexpectedly revealed PVO. The surgery was followed by therapy with antibiotics for 7 months. A follow-up radiograph at 5 years after surgery revealed that solid consolidation has been achieved.
Conclusions: 
Diagnosis of PVO presenting with single spinal compression fracture is very difficult. Although the finding of the high signal intensity in the lesion equal to or higher than that of the cerebrospinal fluid on T2-weighted MR image seemed to be the most reliable diagnostic modality retrospectively, diagnosis of this type of PVO is impossible without histology. A needle biopsy before surgery is strongly recommended.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are frequently utilized in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral body fractures. While prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the treatment of back pain and care for osteoporotic patients, disparities in spine augmentation have not been investigated. We investigated racial and health insurance status differences in the use of spine augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the United States.
Materials and methods: 
Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2005 to 2010, we selected all discharges with a primary diagnosis of vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases-9 code 733.13). Patients who received spine augmentation were identified by using International Classification of Diseases-9 procedure code 81.65 for vertebroplasty and 81.66 for kyphoplasty. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer were excluded. We compared usage rates of spine augmentation by race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) and insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay, and private). Comparisons among groups were made by using χ(2) tests. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was fit to determine variables associated with spine augmentation use.
Results: 
A total of 228,329 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 129,206 (56.6%) received spine augmentation. Among patients with spine augmentation, 97,022 (75%) received kyphoplasty and 32,184 (25%) received vertebroplasty; 57.5% (92,779/161,281) of white patients received spine augmentation compared with 38.7% (1405/3631) of black patients (P < .001). Hispanic patients had significantly lower spine augmentation rates compared with white patients (52.3%, 3777/7222, P < .001) as did Asian/Pacific Islander patients (53.1%, 1784/3361, P < .001). The spine augmentation usage rate was 57.2% (114,768/200,662) among patients with Medicare, significantly higher than that of those with Medicaid (43.9%, 1907/4341, P < .001) and those who self-pay (40.2%, 488/1214, P < .001).
Conclusions: 
Our findings demonstrate substantial racial and health insurance-based disparities in the inpatient use of spinal augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fracture.},

To measure the radiation received by physicians during percutaneous vertebroplasty with use of two types of injection devices with the interventional equipment guided by computed tomography (CT) and an angiographic/CT system.
Materials and methods: 
Twenty consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups, the 1-mL syringe group and the bone cement injector group. Percutaneous vertebroplasties were performed with the IVR-CT system, which combines angiographic and CT equipment with a single fluoroscopy table. Radiation dose to operators was measured as equivalent dose penetrating at a 10-mm tissue depth with use of electronic personal dosimeters attached outside and inside lead aprons. Effective radiation dose (HE) was estimated based on the radiation dose outside the lead apron (Ha) and the radiation dose inside the lead apron (Hb). Differences between the groups in doses and fluoroscopic duration were analyzed.
Results: 
In the 1-mL syringe group and bone cement injector group, mean Ha measurements were 320.8 microSv and 116.2 microSv, respectively. Mean Hb measurements were 14.5 microSv versus 7.8 microSv and mean HE measurements were 48.2 microSv versus 19.7 microSv. Significant differences were found in Ha, Hb, and HE. However, duration of fluoroscopy did not differ significantly between groups.
Conclusions: 
Radiation dose was relatively high for operators performing percutaneous vertebroplasty. The bone cement injector was useful in reducing the level of radiation exposure to operators during vertebroplasty.},

As the experience matures, high rates of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) are being observed. What is unknown is the mechanism of action; it has been postulated but not confirmed that radiation itself is a contributing factor. This case report describes 2 patients who were treated with spine SRS who subsequently developed signal changes on MRI consistent with tumor progression and VCF; however, biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of radiation-induced necrosis in 1 patient and fibrosis in the other. Radionecrosis is a rare and serious side effect of high-dose radiation therapy and represents a diagnostic challenge, as the authors have learned from years of experience with brain SRS. These cases highlight the issues in the new era of spine SRS with respect to relying on imaging alone as a means of determining true tumor progression. In those scenarios in which it is unclear based on imaging if true tumor progression has occurred, the authors recommend biopsy to rule out radiation-induced effects within the bone prior to initiating salvage therapies.},

  abstract={Object: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are a major cause of increased morbidity in older patients. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) versus optimal medical therapy (OMT) in controlling pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients with VCFs. Efficacy was measured as the incidence of new vertebral fractures after PV, restoration of vertebral body height (VBH), and correction of deformity.
Methods: 
Of 105 patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs, 82 were eligible for participation: 40 patients underwent PV and 42 received OMT. Primary outcomes were control of pain and improvement in QOL before treatment, and these were measured at 1 week and at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the beginning of the treatment. Radiological evaluation to measure VBH and sagittal index was performed before and after treatment in both groups and after 36 months of follow-up.
Results: 
The authors found a statistically significant improvement in pain in the PV group compared with the OMT group at 1 week (difference -3.1, 95% CI -3.72 to -2.28; p < 0.001). The QOL improved significantly in the PV group (difference -14, 95% CI -15 to -12.82; p < 0.028). One week after PV, the average VBH restoration was 8 mm and the correction of deformity was 8°. The incidence of new fractures in the OMT group (13.3%) was higher than in the PV group (2.2%; p < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
The PV group had statistically significant improvements in visual analog scale and QOL scores maintained over 24 months, improved VBH maintained over 36 months, and fewer adjacent-level fractures compared with the OMT group.},

  abstract={Background: 
We present the results of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of vertebroplasty versus kyphoplasty in treating vertebral body compression fractures.
Methods: 
Patients with vertebral body compression fractures were randomly assigned to treatment with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Primary endpoints were pain (0-10 scale) and disability assessed using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Outcomes were assessed at 3 days, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year following the procedure.
Results: 
115 subjects were enrolled in the trial with 59 (51.3%) randomly assigned to kyphoplasty and 56 (48.7%) assigned to vertebroplasty. Mean (SD) pain scores at baseline, 3 days, 30 days, and 1 year for kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty were 7.4 (1.9) vs 7.9 (2.0), 4.1 (2.8) vs 3.7 (3.0), 3.4 (2.5) vs 3.6 (2.9), and 3.0 (2.8) vs 2.3 (2.6), respectively (p>0.05 at all time points). Mean (SD) RMDQ scores at baseline, 3 days, 30 days, 180 days, and 1 year were 17.3 (6.6) vs 16.3 (7.4), 11.8 (7.9) vs 10.9 (8.2), 8.6 (7.2) vs 8.8 (8.5), 7.9 (7.4) vs 7.3 (7.7), 7.5 (7.2) vs 6.7 (8.0), respectively (p>0.05 at all time points). For baseline to 12-month assessment in average pain and RMDQ scores, the standardized effect size between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty was small at -0.36 (95% CI -1.02 to 0.31) and -0.04 (95% CI -1.68 to 1.60), respectively.
Conclusions: 
Our study indicates that vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty appear to be equally effective in substantially reducing pain and disability in patients with vertebral body compression fractures.

  abstract={Background: 
Isolated lower segment sacral fracture is very rare. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one case report of S4 stable fracture that was treated conservatively.
Case description: 
Here, we report a 12-year-old girl who sustained an isolated S5 fracture with anterior displacement of S5 and coccyx on S4. The patient initially was managed conservatively 1 month and 25 days. On the failure of this treatment procedure, the patient was treated surgically by partial coccygectomy with S4-S5 fixation after reduction by 2 K-wires.
Conclusions: 
Sacral fracture is difficult to diagnose, especially when the patient has multiple injuries. This is because the emergency doctor may not perform a neurologic examination of the perineum and may miss its diagnosis. Another reason for its misdiagnosis is that the routine anteroposterior plain X-ray may not detect it. Trauma patients with sacrococcygeal pain and tenderness should raise concerns about sacral fracture, and a lateral plain X-ray and/or computed tomography of the sacrococcygeal spine should be performed. Neurologic deficit is rare in lower sacral segment fracture; hence, a trial of conservative management (same as for coccygeal fracture) should be tried first. If the patient does not respond and there is displacement, surgical intervention can be used, because it has a very good response from the patient. In the presence of a neurological deficit, however, surgical intervention should be attempted as soon as possible.},

  abstract={The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate the factors that affect recompression of operated vertebrae after percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) and assess their clinical importance. PKP has been used for VCFs with satisfactory results. Several studies about subsequent VCFs adjacent to cemented vertebrae have been reported after PKP. However, the presence and significance of recompression of operated vertebrae have not been adequately described. In total, 80 patients treated with PKP for single thoracolumbar VCFs were reviewed. The follow-up period was at least 1 year. Patients were divided into those without recompression (maintained group, n = 70) and those with recompression (recompressed group, n = 10). Plain roentgenography (preoperative, operative, and last), preoperative BMD, and preoperative MRI were checked. Age, gender, T-score in BMD, duration of symptom, compression rate (CR) of VCF, reduction rate, kyphotic angle (KA), reduction angle, intervertebral cleft (IVC), and non-PMMA-endplate-contact (NPEC) were evaluated. To evaluate the clinical results, we checked the VAS score at each follow-up period. All data were analyzed statistically. The CR for the recompressed group increased significantly after surgery and decreased at the last follow-up (p < 0.05). The last CR was not significantly different from the preoperative CR. The KA showed the same pattern. The preoperative, postoperative, and last VAS scores were significantly different from one another in both groups (p < 0.05). Between the groups, preoperative KA, postoperative KA, last KA, IVC, and NPEC were significantly different (p < 0.05). In particular, last KA, IVC, and NPEC showed highly significant differences (p < 0.001). In a correlation test for the evaluated factors, IVC (r = 0.557) and NPEC (r = 0.496) were the most significant. The presence of IVC and NPEC may play an important role in inducing recompression of treated vertebrae after PKP. Careful observation of patients with these conditions is necessary to prevent deterioration of their clinical course.},

A prospective study.
Objective: 
To compare surgeons' radiation exposure during kyphoplasty with and without the use of a remote control injection system.
Summary of background data: 
Distance from radiation sources is a critical factor for reducing radiation exposure during spine surgery. A newly designed device was used to minimize operators' radiation exposure during kyphoplasty.
Methods: 
Forty-four patients admitted for single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into 2 groups (groups A and B) and treated with kyphoplasty. The remote control injection system was used only in group B. The radiation doses to the surgeon's eyes, thyroid, chest, and right wrist were recorded with 4 unprotected radiometers simultaneously. Operation time, fluoroscopic time, cement amount, patient-reported pre- and postoperative visual analogue scale scores for pain, and complications were recorded.
Results: 
For group A, the radiation doses at the eyes, thyroid, and right wrist were 1.132 ± 0.104 mSv, 0.647 ± 0.049 mSv, 0.578 ± 0.056 mSv, and 1.877 ± 0.214 mSv, respectively; for Group B, these doses were 0.257 ± 0.067 mSv, 0.201 ± 0.049 mSv, 0.145 ± 0.033 mSv, and 0.353 ± 0.046 mSv, respectively (P < 0.05). Comparisons of the radiation doses the chief surgeon and the resident surgeon received showed that the resident surgeon received more radiation during group A procedures; during group B procedures, the surgeons received similar doses. The proportion of average fluoroscopic time devoted to the bone cement injection step for groups A and B was 64% and 63%, respectively, and the average proportion of the radiation doses that were received during the bone cement injection step was 66% for group A and 36% for group B. Compared with the preoperative visual analogue scale score, the postoperative visual analogue scale score was significantly reduced in both groups.
Conclusion: 
During kyphoplasty, the use of the remote control injection system can significantly reduce surgeons' radiation exposure without affecting the efficiency of procedures.},

  abstract={Kyphoplasty has been shown to provide symptomatic relief of vertebral compression fractures refractory to medical therapy. However, few reports have focused on refracture of cemented vertebrae after kyphoplasty. The presence of cemented vertebrae refracture concurrent with cement fragmentation is an extremely rare condition. We reported an 86-year-old man with a T12 osteoporotic compression fracture undergoing the kyphoplasty treatment. The patient postoperatively continued to have back pain at the same level. The solid lumped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) mass and inadequate use and insufficient filling of PMMA cement were observed in postoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance image (MRI) examination. He refused to receive the surgical intervention, but had not strict compliance with oral anti-osteoporotic medications. Ten months postoperatively, refracture of osteoporotic vertebral body concurrent with cement fragmentation occurred at the previously kyphoplasty-treated vertebral level. Bone mineral analysis showed severe osteoporosis with a T-score of -4.0. The patient finally obtained therapeutic benefit of pain relief and bony union of T12 vertebral body by consistently adhering to anti-osteoporotic medication treatment. This case illustrated that patients who underwent kyphoplasty to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with intravertebral fracture should be strictly followed up and supervised in their anti-osteoporotic medication treatment. The interdigitation injection pattern of PMMA and sufficient PMMA filling with trabeculae in the kyphoplasty procedure also might prevent refracture of the cemented vertebrae concurrent with PMMA fragmentation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Posterior longitudinal ligament reduction (PLLR) has been widely used for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, there are no systemic studies assessing the influence of position parameters of intra-canal fracture fragment (IFF) itself on outcome of reduction. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between position parameters of IFF and the reduction efficacy of PLLR.
Methods: 
Sixty-two patients (average age, 36.9 years) with single thoracolumbar burst fractures and intact posterior longitudinal ligaments were recruited. Patients were divided into reduced and unreduced groups based on IFF reduction situations by PLLR. Preoperative and intraoperative computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate reduction and location parameters of IFF, such as position, width, height, inversion, and horizontal angle, ratio of width of IFF to the transverse diameter of vertebral canal (R 1), and ratio of height of IFF to height of injured vertebrae (R 2) before and after PLLR.
Results: 
There were significant differences in width (P < 0.001), height (P = 0.0141; R 1, P < 0.001), and R 2 (P = 0.0045) between the two groups. When width of IFF was more than 75 % of transverse diameter of vertebral canal and height of IFF was more than 47 % of height of injured vertebrae, the IFF could not be reduced by PLLR.
Conclusions: 
In patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, IFF in apterium of the posterior longitudinal ligament cannot be reduced by PLLR. For thoracolumbar burst fractures that cover the posterior longitudinal ligament, the width and height of IFF are important parameters that influence reduction quality.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiographic findings associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures could also indicate the presence of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries, which were identified through short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR)-weighted MRI.
Patients and method: 
Sixty-four patients were surgically treated for thoracolumbar burst fractures between April 2007 and February 2014 at our institution. Twenty-four patients were excluded from this study because of the lack of STIR-weighted MRIs, and therefore 40 patients were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based upon the integrity of the PLC, which was evaluated using STIR-weighted MRI: a P group with a PLC injury and a C group without such injury. The following radiographic parameters were evaluated: loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), local kyphosis (LK), vertebral body translation, canal compromise (sagittal transverse ratio, STR), interlaminar distance (ISD), supraspinous distance (SSD) and interspinous distance (ISD). Frankel scale score and total severity score (load sharing and thoracolumbar injury classification systems, respectively) were also evaluated.
Results: 
Preoperative STIR-weighted MRI showed that 25 patients had a PLC injury (P group: 15 men and 10 women), and 15 patients did not have a PLC injury (C group: 8 men and 7 women). More patients in the P group had an LK>20°: 14 patients in the P group and 1 patient in the C group (p<0.01). The % SSD differed between the P and C groups (118.8%±53.4% and 88.0%±24.3%, respectively; p<0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that an LK>20° was a risk factor for PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (odds ratio, 55.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.30-2360.1]; p<0.05).
Conclusions: 
These results demonstrate that while LOVBH, vertebral body translation, and canal compromise do not correlate significantly with the presence of a PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar fractures, an LK>20° and increased % SSD are associated with a PLC injury.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Radiographic measurement study.
Objective: 
To develop a standardized cervical injury nomenclature system to facilitate description, communication, and classification among health care providers. The reliability and reproducibility of this system was then examined.
Summary of background data: 
Description of subaxial cervical injuries is critical for treatment decision making and comparing scientific reports of outcomes. Despite a number of available classification systems, surgeons, and researchers continue to use descriptive nomenclature, such as "burst" and "teardrop" fractures, to describe injuries. However, there is considerable inconsistency with use of such terms in the literature.
Methods: 
Eleven distinct injury types and associated definitions were established for the subaxial cervical spine and subsequently refined by members of the Spine Trauma Study Group. A series of 18 cases of patients with a broad spectrum of subaxial cervical spine injuries was prepared and distributed to surgeon raters. Each rater was provided with the full nomenclature document and asked to select primary and secondary injury types for each case. After receipt of the raters' first round of classifications, the cases were resorted and returned to the raters for a second round of review. Interrater and intrarater reliabilities were calculated as percent agreement and Cohen kappa (κ) values. Intrarater reliability was assessed by comparing a given rater's diagnosis from the first and second rounds.
Results: 
Nineteen surgeons completed the first and second rounds of the study. Overall, the system demonstrated 56.4% interrater agreement and 72.8% intrarater agreement. Overall, interrater κ values demonstrated moderate agreement while intrarater κ values showed substantial agreement. Analyzed by injury types, only four (burst fractures, lateral mass fractures, flexion teardrop fractures, and anterior distraction injuries) demonstrated greater than 50% interrater agreement.
Conclusion: 
This study demonstrated that, even in ideal circumstances, there is only moderate agreement among raters regarding cervical injury nomenclature. It is hoped that more familiarity with the proposed system will increase reproducibility in the future. Additional research is required to establish the clinical utility of this novel nomenclature schema.},

  abstract={Background: 
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a commonly used surgery for unstable hangman's fractures. This study investigated the rate of residual deformity after ACDF for these fractures and the effect of residual deformity on clinical and radiologic outcomes.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis of 28 patients with unstable hangman's fractures treated with ACDF was undertaken. The angulation and anterior translation between C2-C3 were measured on lateral radiographs at the time of admission, after skull traction, in the initial postoperative period, and at final follow-up. Residual deformity after surgery was defined as significant angulation (≥6°) and/or translation (≥3 mm). Patients were divided into 2 groups: with and without residual deformity. Follow-up evaluation included clinical and radiologic outcomes.
Results: 
Mean follow-up time was 22 months. The group with residual deformity included 7 patients with an angulation of ≥11° and/or translation of ≥4 mm after skull traction. The remaining 21 patients without residual deformity had an angulation of <11° and translation of <4 mm after skull traction. Neck pain and neurologic deficits improved significantly in all patients after surgery. No significant changes of alignment of middle and lower cervical vertebrae were observed.
Conclusions: 
Residual deformity after ACDF for unstable hangman's fractures is not rare, and it seems to have no significant effect on clinical outcome during short-term follow-up. A severe deformity between C2-C3 after skull traction may be a predictor of residual deformity.},

Both techniques proved effective and safe in numerous retrospective and prospective studies. They now deserve to be incorporated into the standard treatment strategy for painful and incapacitating vertebral fractures. Kyphoplasty seeks not only to stabilize the vertebra, but also to correct the kyphosis induced by the vertebral body collapse. However, the correction is often limited (less than 15 degrees ) and has not been shown to increase the benefits in terms of pain relief or quality-of-life improvement, compared to vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty is more costly than vertebroplasty, which is therefore emerging as the treatment of choice. However, a randomized double-blind trial comparing vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty is needed. Furthermore, a randomized comparison of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty versus noninterventional treatment is needed in patients admitted for pain immediately after a vertebral crush fracture.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multilevel balloon kyphoplasty (BK) on blood pressure, blood gases and cement leakage.
Methods: 
This is a prospective study of 63 patients: 31 were treated for osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures (OVCF) and 32 for osteolytic tumors (OT). Twenty-six patients were treated at 1 level, 15 at 2, 2 at 3, 6 at 4, 3 at 5, 4 at 6, 5 at 7 and 2 at 8. PPMA was used in 43 patients and calcium phosphate in 20. All patients were treated under general anesthesia with continuous invasive monitoring of hemodynamic changes, arterial blood gases and peripheral and regional cerebral oxygen saturation.
Results: 
Two patients had a transient drop in blood pressure between 21 and 42 % during simultaneous inflation of all four balloons at two levels and three more patients during cement injection (two PMMA, one calcium phosphate). Five patients had a cement leak (7.9 %), which was unrelated to the cement type or number of levels. Blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure and arterial oxygen partial pressure decreased statistically, but without any clinical significance after cement insertion. Peripheral and regional cerebral oxygen saturation remained unchanged. One-way ANOVA revealed no difference between these changes when clustered by the groups single level, two levels and three or more levels.
Conclusion: 
BK performed under general anesthesia appears to be safe when applied in multiple levels in the same seating provided the balloons are inflated sequentially and not simultaneously and the cement is inserted slowly in a very doughy state. Close monitoring of cardiorespiratory factors is valuable. Its rare circulatory effects are unrelated to the number of levels or the cement type.},

  abstract={Background: 
In 2009 two RCTs were publicated to question the efficacy of vertebroplasty comparing with sham treatment (ST) in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), which provoked an academic debate on the efficacy of PVA. The purposes of our study were to compare clinical differences in pain relief, spinal functional outcomes, and overall quality of life between PVA and CT for painful osteoporotic VCFs.
Methods: 
We searched PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Knowledge from January 1980 to June 2013 with Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. In this Meta-analysis dichotomous and continuous variables were calculated using the risk ratio (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively.
Results: 
Eight studies involving 987 patients met the criteria for inclusion. The VAS SMD was favoring the experimental group significantly (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis suggested that the patients performed PVA with mean fracture age less than 3 months would got pain relief earlier and more durable than the control group (P <0.05). The SMD of spinal function assessed with RDQ and Oswestry LBP data was in favor of the experimental groups. QOL outcome improvement was demonstrated statistically significant at early, middle and late-term follow-up for PVA than the control group (P <0.05).
Conclusions: 
In conclusion, this meta-analysis, which evaluated PVA for osteoporotic VCFs, demonstrated significant improvement regarding VAS, spinal function and QOL outcomes. The optimal fracture age was less than 12 weeks.},

  abstract={Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating worldwide disease with an estimated annual incidence of 10 to 83 affected individuals per million inhabitants. These injuries typically impact younger individuals and reduce quality-adjusted life years with estimated lifetime costs exceeding $4 million per person. Hence it is critical to establish and refine clear practice guidelines for acute management of SCI. In 2013 the Joint Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) released a revision of the 2002 guidelines for Cervical SCI. In the present report we explore seven subsections for management of specific cervical injury types, review key supporting literature, and provide an update on recent studies since the publication of the 2013 guidelines. Our review finds a paucity of Level I and Level II treatment recommendations for cervical spine injuries, with the exception of subaxial cervical spine injury classification and surgical management for Type II odontoid fractures in the elderly. We recommend the systematic implementation of large randomized controlled studies across diverse demographics and ethnicities, injury mechanisms and morphologies to address pressing limitations in the current literature. The cohesive effort to adopt the 2013 AANS/CNS Guidelines and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements for SCI as part of a multicenter international approach will enable reproducible data collection and robust analyses toward achieving this goal.},

  abstract={Background: 
To analyze risk factors and correlation of secondary adjacent vertebral compression fracture in percutaneous kyphoplasty.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 139 patients underwent PKP in our hospital for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture between January 2013 and December 2014 and had completed follow-up data more than one year were selected randomly. Participants were divided into two groups in accordance with whether adjacent vertebral compression fracture occurred. The gender, age, body mass index, smoking history, bone mineral density, bone metabolic markers and affected vertebra number preoperative, balloon volume, cement volume, recovery rate of vertebral height, bone cement leakage intraoperative and anti-osteoporosis treatment postoperative, oswestry disability index and visual analog scale in the first three days after surgery were observed.
Results: 
There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in bone mineral density value, balloon volume, cement volume, recovery rate of vertebral height and bone cement leakage between two groups.
Conclusion: 
Patients with a lower bone mineral density value preoperative, larger balloon volume, cement volume, recovery rate of vertebral height and bone cement leakage intraoperative have an increased risk of adjacent vertebral compression fracture after percutaneous kyphoplasty.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Methodological systematic review.
Objective: 
To identify the risk factors for new vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in patients after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and to grade the evidence according to the quality of included studies.
Summary of background data: 
PVP is an effective procedure for the treatment of VCFs. A major concern after PVP in patients with osteoporosis is the occurrence of new VCFs in the untreated vertebrae. The risk factors for new VCFs after PVP reported thus far remain controversial. These risk factors have neither been well identified or summarized. This systematic review was performed to identify the risk factors for new VCFs after PVP.
Methods: 
Noninterventional studies evaluating the risk factors for new VCFs of patients with osteoporosis after PVP were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and OVID databases (all up to November 2012). Only observational studies with eligible data were included. Quality of included studies was assessed by a modified quality assessment tool, which was previously designed for observational study. The effects of studies were combined with the study quality score using a model of best-evidence synthesis.
Results: 
Twenty-four observational studies involving 3789 patients were included. These articles were published between 2004 and 2012. According to the quality assessment criteria for included studies, 8 studies were deemed as high-quality studies, 6 as moderate-quality studies, and 10 as low-quality studies. There were strong evidences of 3 risk factors, including lower bone mineral density, lower body mass index, intradiscal cement leakage, and vertebral height restoration. We also identified 6 moderate-evidence factors including lower body mass index, number of pre-existing vertebral fractures, thoracolumbar junction in initial VCFs, cement distraction, older age, and number of treated vertebrae. Thirteen factors were classified into the limited-evidence risk factors.
Conclusion: 
Although there is no conclusive evidence for new VCFs of patients with osteoporosis after PVP procedure, these data provide evidence to guide the surgeon and develop optimal preventions for new VCFs after PVP. Special attention should be paid to the 3 strong-evidence risk factors. Further studies were still required to evaluate the effects of the earlier mentioned risk factors.
Level of evidence: 
2.},

  abstract={Background: 
The risk factors for new vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) after vertebroplasty are unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify potential risk factors.
Methods: 
A systematic electronic literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library; the databases were searched from the earliest available records in 1966 to May 2015. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies, and Stata 11.0 was used to analyse the data.
Results: 
The primary factors that were associated with new fractures after vertebroplasty were low bone mineral density (SMD -0.375; 95% CI -0.579 to -0.171), steroid usage (OR 2.632; 95% CI 1.399 to 4.950) and the presence of multiple treated vertebrae (OR 2.027; 95% CI 1.442 to 2.851). The data did not support that age, sex, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage, vacuum cleft, thoracolumbar junction, cement volume, kyphosis correction, or intradiscal cement leakage could lead to infection after vertebroplasty.
Conclusions: 
The present analysis demonstrated that low bone mineral density, the presence of multiple treated vertebrae and a history of steroid usage were associated with the new VCFs after vertebroplasty. Patients with these factors should be informed of the potential increased risk.},

  abstract={Background and objective: 
Recollapse of the augmented vertebrae after percutaneous vertebral augmentation treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has obtained much attention. Although many potential risk factors have been proposed, they are still disputed. The aim of our study was to identify the characteristics of the augmented vertebrae that had undergone a recollapse according to a systematic review from the earliest available records up to August 2017 and then conduct a meta-analysis based on eligible studies to assess significant potential risk factors for recollapse of the augmented vertebrae.
Methods: 
Fourteen studies were identified for investigating recollapse of the augmented vertebrae. Of those studies, 9 studies were eligible for meta-analysis.
Results: 
Pooled results showed that 5 primary factors were associated with recollapse of the augmented vertebrae, including preoperative intravertebral cleft, the affected vertebrae in the thoracolumbar region, preoperative severe kyphotic deformity, solid lump cement distribution pattern, and higher vertebral height restoration. It was possibly another risk factor that the distance between PMMA and superior end plate was relatively large.
Conclusions: 
Careful observation of patients with these risk factors and reasonable intervention could be useful to prevent deterioration of their clinical course.},

  abstract={We have recently observed an increased risk for vertebral fractures (VF) in a randomized controlled trial comparing the analgesic effect of vertebroplasty (VP) versus conservative treatment in symptomatic VF. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk factors related to the development of VF after VP in these patients. We evaluated risk factors including age, gender, bone mineral density, the number, type, and severity of vertebral deformities at baseline, the number of vertebral bodies treated, the presence and location of disk cement leakage, bone remodeling (determining bone turnover markers) and 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels at baseline in all patients. Twenty-nine radiologically new VF were observed in 17 of 57 patients undergoing VP, 72% adjacent to the VP. Patients developing VF after VP showed an increased prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and higher P1NP values. The principal factor related to the development of VF after VP in multivariate analysis was 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL (RR, 15.47; 95% CI, 2.99-79.86, p < 0.0001), whereas age >80 years (RR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.70-6.03, p = 0.0007) and glucocorticoid therapy (RR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.61-8.26, p = 0.0055) constituted the principal factors in the overall study population. Increased risk of VF after VP was also associated with cement leakage into the inferior disk (RR, 6.14; 95% CI, 1.65-22.78, p = 0.044) and more than one vertebral body treated during VP (RR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.03-34.3, p = 0.044). In conclusion, nearly 30% of patients with osteoporotic VF treated with VP had a new VF after the procedure. Age, especially >80 years, the presence of inferior disk cement leakage after the procedure, the number of cemented vertebrae, and low 25(OH)D serum levels were related to the development of new VF in these patients, with the latter indicating the need to correct vitamin D deficiency prior to performing VP.},

  abstract={Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is an efficient procedure to treat pain due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). However, some patient populations experience recurrent vertebral fracture after initial successful procedure. There are a lot of literatures about the effectiveness of this procedure but few concerning the development of recurrent, new compression fracture. This is a retrospective review of all PVPs performed in author's institution from September 1999 to December 2001 to investigate the factors related to the development of new symptomatic OVCFs after PVPs. A retrospective review of 244 cases of PVP for symptomatic OVCFs at 382 levels was performed. Sociodemographic, clinical, radiologic, and procedural data were analyzed and compared between the two patient groups (control group : no further symptomatic OVCFs after the initial PVP, "new symptomatic fracture" group: with newly developed symptomatic OVCF). Statistical analysis was performed between the variables of the two groups. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Over all, 38 among 244 treated patients (15.6%) had experienced newly developed symptomatic OVCF(s) during the follow up period (mean 52.5 months). Old age and the presence of multiple treated vertebrae at the initial PVP were assessed as a strong parameter for predicting new symptomatic OVCF. With increasing preoperative wedging deformity the risk of developing new symptomatic OVCF decreased. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 1 year fracture-free rate was 92.2%. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that 7.8% of the patients would experience new symptomatic OVCF within 1 year after initial PVP. A preoperative only mild wedge deformity of the fractured vertebra(e) could indicate the increased risk of developing new symptomatic OVCF after vertebroplasty.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Sacral insufficiency (SI) fractures can occur as a late side effect of pelvic radiation therapy. Our goal was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of SI fractures in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.
Materials and methods: 
Between 1989 and 2004, 562 patients with non-metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma were treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision. The median radiotherapy dose was 45 Gy. The hospital records and radiology reports of these patients were reviewed to identify those with pelvic fractures. Radiology images of patients with pelvic fractures were then reviewed to identify those with SI fractures.
Results: 
Among the 562 patients, 15 had SI fractures. The 3-year actuarial rate of SI fractures was 3.1%. The median time to SI fractures was 17 months (range, 2-34 months). The risk of SI fractures was significantly higher in women compared to men (5.8% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.014), and in whites compared with non-whites (4% vs. 0%, p = 0.037). On multivariate analysis, gender independently predicted for the risk of SI fractures (hazard ratio, 3.25; p = 0.031). Documentation about the presence or absence of pain was available for 13 patients; of these 7 (54%) had symptoms requiring pain medications. The median duration of pain was 22 months. No patient required hospitalization or invasive intervention for pain control.
Conclusions: 
SI fractures were uncommon in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer. The risk of SI fractures was significantly higher in women. Most cases of SI fractures can be managed conservatively with pain medications.},

  abstract={Background: 
Surgery with high-dose radiation and high-dose radiation alone for sacral chordomas have shown promising local control rates. However, we have noted frequent sacral insufficiency fractures and perceived this rate to be higher than previously reported.
Questions::Purposes: 
We wished (1) to characterize the incidence of sacral insufficiency fractures in patients with chordomas of the sacrum who received high-dose radiation, and (2) to determine whether patients treated with surgery plus high-dose radiation or high-dose radiation alone are more likely to experience a sacral fracture, and to compare time to fracture in these groups.
Methods: 
Sixty-two patients who received high-dose radiation for sacral chordomas with (n = 44) or without surgical resection (n = 18) between 1992 and 2013 were included in this retrospective study. At our institution, sacral chordomas generally are treated by preoperative radiotherapy, followed by en bloc resection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Radiation alone, with an intent to cure, is offered to patients who otherwise are not good surgical candidates or patients who elect radiotherapy based on tumor location and the anticipated morbidity after surgery (such as sexual, bowel, or bladder dysfunction). MRI and CT scans were evaluated for evidence of sacral insufficiency fractures. Complete followup was available at a minimum of 2 years (or until fracture or death) for all 18 patients who underwent radiation alone, whereas 14% (six of 44 patients) in the surgery plus radiation group (9% [three of 33] after high sacrectomy and 27% [three of 11] after low sacrectomy) were lost to followup before 2 years.
Results: 
Sacral insufficiency fractures occurred in 29 of the 62 patients (47%). A total of 25 of 33 patients (76%) with high sacrectomy had fractures develop compared with zero of 11 (0%) after low sacrectomy, and four of the 18 patients (22%) who had high-dose radiation alone (p < 0.001). The fracture rate was greater in the high sacrectomy group than in the low sacrectomy group (p < 0.001) and the radiation only group (p < 0.001). There was no difference with the numbers evaluated in fracture probability between patients in the low-sacrectomy group and those treated with radiation alone (p = 0.112). The fracture-free survival probability was 0.99 for the low sacrectomy group at all times as there were no insufficiency fractures in this group; the 1-year fracture-free survival probability was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.35-0.69) after high sacrectomy, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.57-0.94) after radiation alone; the 2-year fracture-free survival probability was 0.36 (95% CI, 0.19-0.52) after high sacrectomy and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.50-0.91) after radiation alone; and the 5-year fracture-free survival probability was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.04-0.30) after high sacrectomy and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.50-0.91) after radiation alone.
Conclusions: 
Acknowledging the limitations of potential differences in baseline and followup among treatment groups in our study, we found that almost ½ of our patients experienced an insufficiency fracture. We found that the fracture rate was greater in the surgery group compared with the radiation alone group and that high sacrectomy accounted for all fractures in the surgery group. These findings can be used to inform patients and also support the need for further research to elucidate the influence of high-dose radiation on bone quality.
Level of evidence: 
Level III, therapeutic study.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective review of sacral insufficiency fractures.
Objective: 
Determine incidence of sacral insufficiency fractures after posterior lumbosacral fusion. Review the pertinent literature. Describe the ability of lumbopelvic fixation to restore the alignment of these fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Fractures of the sacrum are rare injuries that have been described at the caudal end of lumbopelvic constructs. Without a high index of suspicion, this entity can be overlooked, causing a diagnostic delay.
Methods: 
Review of patients treated at our institution from 2002 to 2005.
Results: 
Nine patients meet our inclusion criteria. Sacral insufficiency fractures were recognized on an average of 5 weeks in the 6 patients with the index procedure performed at our institution (Incidence of fracture with short segment instrumentation is 1.3%, whereas long segment fixation has an incidence of 3.1%). The other 3 referred patients had an average delay in diagnosis of 8 months. Two patients underwent immediate fracture stabilization and fusion. The remaining 7 patients were initially treated nonoperatively. Four patients abandoned bracing an average of 3.3 months after initiation of treatment. For all of the surgical candidates, preoperative kyphosis measured 9.7 degrees and anterolisthesis averaged 10 mm. Postoperative measurement improved to a mean kyphosis of 2.3 degrees and mean displacement of 1.2 mm. All operatively treated fractures healed and the patients regained their ambulatory capacity.
Conclusion: 
Sacral insufficiency fractures are an uncommon complication of segmental posterior lumbosacral fixation in osteoporotic patients. They are potentially unstable fractures and kyphosis and displacement may contribute to persistent problems of pain and postural malalignment. The diagnosis may be difficult and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients who do not improve during the postoperative course. Lumbopelvic fixation is a useful salvage treatment modality for patients who fail nonoperative treatment.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Percutaneous sacroplasty involves image-guided injection of bone cement for sacral insufficiency fractures to alleviate pain and facilitate mobility. Correct sacral placement of the cement and the risk of cement extravasation present procedural challenges. This study compares the occurrence, number, location, and surface area of high viscosity radiopaque bone cement extravasation via biplane fluoroscopy with Dyna CT between the fluoroscopically-guided intraoperative long-axis and short-axis sacroplasty techniques in osteoporotic cadavers.
Methods: 
Ten osteoporotic cadavers underwent bilateral percutaneous instillation of VertaPlex HV High Viscosity Radiopaque Bone Cement. Long- and short-axis sacroplasty techniques were randomly assigned to zone 1 of the left or right sacral ala of each cadaver. Cement extravasation data were summarized by technique (long-axis vs short-axis) and time period (15-min and 3-hour post-procedure syngo DynaCT scan) in the form of point and CI estimates for the true proportions of cement extravasation.
Results: 
No procedural sacral extravasation differences were observed between the long-axis and short-axis sacroplasty techniques. There were no occurrences of intra-procedural or post-procedural cement extravasation at 15 min or 3 hours in association with either the long-axis sacroplasty technique or the short-axis sacroplasty technique.
Conclusions: 
The long- and short-axis sacroplasty techniques, using high viscosity cement with careful post-procedural positioning, result in no occurrence of cement extravasation in porous osteoporotic cadaver bone.},

Clinical performance and safety of two percutaneous vertebral cement augmentation (VA) procedures (SpineJack® and Kyphx Xpander® balloon) were compared in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures. Both techniques were safe, efficient, and led to a rapid and marked improvement in clinical signs; nevertheless, SpineJack showed better restoration of vertebral heights and angles, maintained over time.
Introduction: 
In patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), both SpineJack® (SJ) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) led to a rapid and marked improvement in clinical signs. This pilot, monocentric, investigator-initiated, prospective study aimed to compare two percutaneous vertebral augmentation procedures in the painful osteoporotic VCF treatment.
Methods: 
Thirty patients were randomized to receive SJ (n = 15) or BKP (n = 15). Analgesic consumption, back pain intensity (visual analog scale (VAS)), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were recorded preoperatively, at 5 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Quality of life (EQ-VAS score) was evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Spine X-rays were taken 48 h prior to procedure and 5 days and 6 and 12 months after.
Results: 
SpineJack® led to a significantly shorter intervention period (23 vs 32 min; p < 0.001), a strong, rapid, and long-lasting decline in pain (94 vs 82 % at 12 months) and in functional disability (94 vs 90 % at 12 months), a greater and sustainable mean correction of anterior (12 ± 13 vs 0 ± 7 % for BKP, p = 0.003) and central height (12 ± 10 vs 2 ± 6 % for BKP, p = 0.001) at 12 months, and a larger restoration of the vertebral body angle still evident 12 months after implantation (-4.4° ± 5.8° vs 0.2° ± 3.0° for BKP; p = 0.012).
Conclusions: 
This pilot study showed that both techniques were safe and efficient for the osteoporotic VCF treatment. Radiological results indicate that the SpineJack® procedure has a higher potential for vertebral body height restoration and maintenance over time.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a curved needle compared with traditional (noncurved needle) techniques in a large single-center experience.
Materials and methods: 
This study was a retrospective analysis of 243 consecutive vertebral augmentation procedures over a 17-month period. Curved needle procedures were compared with noncurved needle procedures for baseline clinical variables, complication rate, pain relief, and improvement in disability. Procedure duration and fluoroscopy time were compared between the two cohorts.
Results: 
Between curved needle and noncurved needle procedures, there were no statistically significant differences in the baseline clinical variables, fracture location, and fracture etiology. No complications were noted in either group. In both groups, there was a median improvement in the visual analog scale (VAS) score of 2.0 points (P = .62). More than 90% of procedures in both groups resulted in some pain improvement (P = .78). For both groups, the median improvement in disability on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) was 4.0 points (P = .69). Approximately 70% of procedures in both groups resulted in improvement in disability (P = 1.00). In single-level cases, there were shorter procedure times (51.8 min ± 2.7 vs 62.8 min ± 2.2, P = .002) and shorter fluoroscopy times (P = .31) for curved needle procedures.
Conclusions: 
The curved needle is as safe and effective as traditional vertebral augmentation techniques in treating the pain and disability related to vertebral compression fractures. Additionally, the curved needle is associated with shorter procedure duration and reduced fluoroscopy time.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To retrospectively assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for painful osteolytic spinal metastases when treating more than three vertebrae per session.
Methods: 
A total of 153 patients with painful osteolytic spinal metastases underwent PVP. Group A patients (n = 93) underwent PVP at up to three vertebral levels per session. Group B patients (n = 60) underwent PVP at more than three levels in one session. Pain, quality of life (QoL), and mobility were assessed before and after PVP. Minor and major complications were systematically assessed.
Results: 
Both groups experienced significant pain relief and QoL improvement after the intervention (p < 0.001). Mobility improvement was observed in both groups, despite worse mobility status before PVP in group B compared with group A. There was no significant difference between the two groups throughout the follow-up period in overall pain relief and improvement in QoL and mobility. There was also no significant difference between groups in minor and major complications.
Conclusions: 
Multilevel vertebroplasty is safe and effective for the treatment of multiple osteolytic spinal metastases. Multilevel PVP relieves pain and improves QoL and mobility.
Key points: 
• Percutaneous vertebroplasty is safe and effective for painful osteolytic spinal metastases. • Multilevel vertebroplasty does not cause more complications than single-level vertebroplasty. • Multiple spinal metastases patients may regain functional independence after multilevel vertebroplasty.},

The clinical efficacies of these three treatments were evaluated by comparing their PMMA cement leakages, cement patterns, height restoration percentages, wedge angles, visual analogue scales (VAS), and oswestry disability index (ODI) at the pre- and post-operative time points. 6.67%, 3.33%, and 0% of patients had PMMA leakage in PVP, PKP, and PMCP groups, respectively. Three (solid, trabecular, and mixed patterns), two (solid and mixed patterns), and one (mixed patterns) types of cement patterns were observed in PVP, PKP, and PMCP groups, respectively. PKP and PMCP treatments had better height restoration ability than PVP treatment. PVP, PKP, and PMCP treatments had significant and similar ability in pain relief and functional recovery ability for the treatment of VCFs. These results indicate minimally invasive techniques were effective methods for the treatment of VCFs. Moreover, these initial outcomes suggest PMCP treatment may be better than both PVP treatment and PKP treatment.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
There is no report on the safety and therapeutic efficacy of the second treatment for new vertebral fractures developed after vertebroplasty. This study aims to examine the therapeutic effects and clinical characteristics in patients undergoing a second vertebroplasty for these new fractures.
Methods: 
The initial treatment group included 182 patients (276 vertebrae) who underwent vertebroplasty. Among 182 patients, the second treatment group included 34 patients (36 vertebrae) who developed new fractures postoperatively, which were retreated. Analgesic effects on the day following surgery, frequency of new fractures during the 12 month period after surgery, and other clinical characteristics were compared between the initial and second treatment groups. Furthermore, similar comparisons were performed between patients with adjacent and non-adjacent vertebral fractures in the second treatment group.
Results: 
The improvement rates in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were 83.4% in the initial treatment group and 85.6% in the second treatment group (P = 0.27). The frequencies of new fractures occurring within 12 months after surgery were 20.9% and 20.6%, respectively. Within the second treatment group, the VAS improvement rates were 76.7% in the adjacent and 88.2% in the non-adjacent vertebral fracture groups (P = 0.83). However, the frequencies of subsequent new fractures after the second treatment were 31.6% and 5.9%, respectively, being significantly higher in the adjacent vertebral fracture group (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: 
Additional vertebroplasty for new fractures exerts analgesic effects similar to those of the initial procedure. However, we must note that the second treatment for new adjacent vertebral fractures frequently causes more subsequent new fractures in comparison with non-adjacent fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To assess the clinical effect of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in the treatment of metastatic spinal tumors in patients with posterior wall defect.
Methods: 
The treated vertebrae bodies were divided into four groups: group A, non-posterior vertebral wall defect; group B, posterior vertebral wall with cribriform defects; group C, posterior vertebral wall with local fragmentation defects; group D, posterior vertebral wall with severe defects. The injected volume of bone cement, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), cement leakage and survival were analyzed.
Results: 
The injected volume of bone cement for group A was significantly higher than posterior wall defect group (including group B, C, and D). No significant differences about the injected volume of bone cement among the posterior wall defect groups. The incidence of bone cement leakage for group A was not significantly different as compared to posterior vertebral wall defect group. However, there were significant differences with respect to the incidence of bone cement leakage among the posterior wall defect groups. In four groups the postoperative VAS pain scores and KPS were statistical different as comparison to the preoperative values. No statistical difference with respect to the VAS pain scores and KPS was observed at any time point between the non-posterior wall defect group and posterior wall defect group.
Conclusion: 
PVP can be an effective treatment for metastatic spinal tumors in patients with posterior wall deficiency; however, care should be taken to control the distribution of the bone cement due to the relatively high risk of cement leakage.},

We retrospectively studied patients with single-level NVCF after initial BKP in our hospital from January 2007 to August 2014. The mean follow-up time from secondary BKP was 13.78 ± 3.18 (12-24) months. Visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores were assessed prior to the initial BKP, one day after initial BKP, prior to the secondary BKP, one day after the secondary BKP, and at last follow-up. Kyphotic angle and vertebral heights were also compared for secondary BKP. Data were compared between patients with adjacent NVCF and remote NVCF.
Results: 
36 patients were investigated. Compared with pre-operative value of initial and secondary BKP, patients in both groups gained statistical significant improvements for VAS and ODI after initial and secondary BKP, respectively (P < 0.05), and this improvement maintained at final follow-up. No statistical difference in VAS was found between the 2 groups after initial BKP and prior to the secondary BKP (P > 0.05), but patients in remote NVCF group achieved better VAS score than patients in adjacent NVCF group after the secondary BKP and at the final follow-up (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were detected in ODI between the 2 groups prior to the initial BKP, one day after initial BKP, prior to the secondary BKP and 1 day after the secondary BKP (P > 0.05), but the ODI scores were higher in adjacent NVCF group than in remote NVCF at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Kyphotic angle and vertebral heights were significantly restored and maintained after secondary BKP within groups, respectively.
Conclusions: 
Secondary BKP is an effective procedure for treating NVCF after initial BKP. Patients with new fracture in remote level gain slightly better pain relief than those in the adjacent level.},

  abstract={Although recent guidelines for dealing with missing data emphasize the need for sensitivity analyses, and such analyses have a long history in statistics, universal recommendations for conducting and displaying these analyses are scarce. We propose graphical displays that help formalize and visualize the results of sensitivity analyses, building upon the idea of 'tipping-point' analysis for randomized experiments with a binary outcome and a dichotomous treatment. The resulting 'enhanced tipping-point displays' are convenient summaries of conclusions obtained from making different modeling assumptions about missingness mechanisms. The primary goal of the displays is to make formal sensitivity analysesmore comprehensible to practitioners, thereby helping them assess the robustness of the experiment's conclusions to plausible missingness mechanisms. We also present a recent example of these enhanced displays in amedical device clinical trial that helped lead to FDA approval.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral metastases are the most frequent vertebral tumor. Transarterial embolization (TAE) devascularizes the tumor, resulting in tumor necrosis. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), a minimally invasive procedure, can effectively relieve tumor-related pain and improve spine stability. Unfortunately, the PVP technique is of limited use in controlling the progression of vertebral tumor, especially for paravertebral metastases. TAE combined with PVP may achieve a better control on vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension, but little information regarding the combination is available.
Objectives: 
The present study is intended to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination of TAE and PVP in patients suffering from vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension.
Study design: 
Sequential TAE followed by PVP was used in 25 patients with symptomatic vertebral metastases. The safety and effectiveness of the sequential therapy were evaluated.
Setting: 
Three hospitals' clinical research centers.
Methods: 
This retrospective study was conducted with 25 consecutive patients (11 women and 14 men; mean age 59.3 years, range 38 - 80 years) with vertebral and paravertebral metastases from March 2009 to March 2014. The patients were treated with TAE, and 5 - 7 days later with the PVP procedure. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the control of pain using visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. X2 or Fisher exact testing was performed for univariate analysis of variables. The VAS scores between groups were compared using ONE-WAY ANOVA, with a P-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Results: 
All the TAE and PVP procedures were successfully done. Mean VAS scores decreased after TAE (from 8.64 ± 0.58 to 5.32 ± 1.46, P < 0.05) and further decreased after PVP (from 5.32 ± 1.46 to 2.36 ± 0.54, P < 0.05), and the decrease in VAS lasted until the third month (3.08 ± 1.52, P > 0.05) follow-up. However, VAS scores at the sixth month were statistically higher than those at the third month (4.8 ± 1.24 versus 3.08 ± 1.52, P < 0.05), VAS scores at the twelfth month were statistically higher than those at the sixth month (6.29 ± 1.07 versus 4.8 ± 1.24, P < 0.05). We found paravertebral cement leakage in 6 cases. No clinical or symptomatic complications were observed. In the follow-up, no patient showed further vertebral compression or spinal canal compromise.
Limitations: 
This is a retrospective clinical study of a small number of patients.
Conclusion: 
The sequential TAE followed by PVP is safe and effective in treating vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension.

Cessations of lactation led to gradual decrease in bone turnover markers and PTHrP and improvement in bone mineral density. Pregnancy- and postpartum-associated osteoporosis is an uncommon condition characterized by the occurrence of fractures during late pregnancy or the puerperium. The patient presented postpartum with severe back pain and multiple vertebral fractures. Metabolic evaluation performed at presentation revealed hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, increased alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D insufficiency, normal serum protein immunoelectrophoresis, and a detectable level of PTHrP. Serum levels of bone turnover markers were markedly increased. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine was severely reduced. After cessation of lactation, the PTHrP level became undetectable. Bone turnover markers gradually decreased to normal and bone mineral density improved. Several factors contributed to the reduced bone mass in this patient, including amenorrhea treated with oral contraceptives, suppressive levothyroxine treatment, and lactation of twins with increased PTHrP. Patients with severely reduced bone mass need surveillance during pregnancy and lactation and should possibly consider avoiding breastfeeding. Patients with hypoparathyroidism should temporarily reduce their alphacalcidiol dose while lactating.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective follow-up study.
Objectives: 
To review and analyze the sexual function of patients who have sustained lumbar fractures with incomplete paraparesis.
Summary of background data: 
As a result of advances in surgical techniques, most patients with lumbar fractures have significant recovery of neurologic status. Because motor functions are important to patients, most of the studies have concentrated their analyses on motor recovery. Many patients who have almost completely recovered motor function, however, may have sexual dysfunction, especially men.
Methods: 
Forty-three patients with lumbar fractures that resulted in incomplete paraparesis were analyzed. American Spinal Injury Association motor index points were determined for each patient before and after surgery and used for comparison between American Spinal Injury Association motor index and international index of erectile function score. Eleven male patients who reported sexual dysfunction were evaluated by using Rigiscan.
Results: 
During the follow-up period, 42 patients showed neurologic recovery. Average improvement of American Spinal Injury Association motor score was 13. 1 and average international index of erectile function score was 45. Average improvement of American Spinal Injury Association motor score for patients who had not reported sexual dysfunction was 12.5, and average international index of erectile function score was 52. For 11 patients in the sexual dysfunction group, preoperative motor score was 28.0, and average improvement of score was 14.9. Nocturnal penile tumescence monitoring results were abnormal in four cases. Averaged international index of erectile function score was 15. There was a statistically significant difference between the sexually healthy and dysfunctional groups in international index of erectile function score (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was noted in American Spinal Injury Association motor score.
Conclusions: 
Neurologic recovery after lumbar fractures was improved. Regardless of neurologic recovery, most patients reported some disability, usually caused by pain and occasionally sexual dysfunction. Impairment of sexual function was present in four patients (9.3%). Although these patients may preserve psychiatric erection potential, they usually experienced sexual problems.},

Comparision of the former non-standard technique showed a significant difference between the two groups. 46 bursting fracture cases obtained anatomical reduction in 3-D and rigid fixation after follow-up for 12 months. Pedicle screw, inserted through the pedicle anatomical axis can reach the maximum depth, that will achieve best stability and ideal clinical result.

  abstract={Objective: 
To determine whether patients with osteoporotic compression fractures would have decreased fracture recurrence or a longer time before refracture after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) if they also participated in the Rehabilitation of Osteoporosis Program-Exercise (ROPE) instruction, which includes back-strengthening exercises.
Patients and methods: 
We reviewed and collected data from the medical records of 507 patients with osteoporosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, from July 1, 1998, through August 31, 2005. Patients older than 55 years with at least 1 radiographically confirmed nontraumatic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) were identified, and those with evidence of secondary osteoporosis, traumatically induced VCF, long-term oral corticosteroid use, or bone malignancy were excluded. The remaining 57 patients were categorized into 3 groups: those receiving treatment with ROPE only (n=20), PVP only (n=20), or both PVP and ROPE (n=17). The end point was the refracture date or date of the last recorded follow-up if no refracture occurred. Statistical analysis of time-to-recurrence data was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test (P less than .05).
Results: 
The median time before refracture for patients treated with PVP was 4.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.4-9.3 months; for patients treated with ROPE only, 60.4 months (95% CI, 27.6 months-upper limit undefined); and for patients treated with PVP-ROPE, 20.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 months-upper limit undefined) (P <001).
Conclusion: 
This retrospective study showed that a targeted exercise program after PVP significantly decreased fracture recurrence. Refracture rates also were lower in the ROPE-only group vs the PVP-only group.},

  abstract={The objective of this study was to simplify the opacifying mixing process of the bone cement and contrast used for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP).

In vitro biomechanical testing of ultimate compressive strength was carried out in all samples. Following the conclusion of a proper bone cement mixture regimen drawn from the in vitro study, PVP was performed in 125 patients: 58 with cancer, 12 with hemangioma, and 54 with osteoporotic fracture. The ultimate compressive strength in group III was decreased by 38% compared to groups II and I. Proper fluoroscopic visualization was achieved in all PVP procedures using this mixture. There were no major complications associated with injection of the cement mixture. Complete (CR) and partial response (PR) was obtained in 64% and 32.8%, respectively. No further vertebral collapse occurred during follow-up. The regimen using iodinated contrast for cement visualization during PVP provides a simple and convenient new method for mixing. Although the biomechanical strength is altered by the contrast medium added, it seems insignificant in clinical practice based on the authors' limited experience.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
To evaluate the efficacy of single-stage posterior vertebral column resection for old thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations with spinal cord injury.
Methods: 
From January 2007 to June 2013, twelve male patients (average age, 32.6 years; range 19-57 years) with old fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord injury underwent single-stage posterior vertebral column resection and internal fixation. All patients were assessed for relief of the pain and restoration of neurologic function. Postoperative Cobb angle was measured and bone graft fusion was evaluated by X-ray. A systematic review of 25 studies evaluating surgical management of thoracolumbar fractures with spinal cord injuries was also performed.
Results: 
From our case series, six of the nine patients with Frankel grade A had significant improvement in urination and defecation after surgery. The three patients with Frankel grades B and C had progression of 1-2 grades after surgery. Bony fusion was achieved and local back pain was relieved in all patients after surgery. From our systematic review of 25 studies, the majority of patients had improved back pain, the postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly reduced compared with pre-operative kyphotic angle.
Conclusion: 
Single-stage posterior vertebral column resection and internal fixation for old thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations is an ideal treatment allowing for thorough decompression, relief of pain, correction of deformities, and restoration of spinal stability.
Level of evidence:

  abstract={Background: 
Traditionally, odontoid fractures have been treated with different bracing techniques resulting in variable degrees of successful healing. Surgical intervention is becoming more widely practiced as a primary intervention. The purpose of this report was to survey our recent experience in southern Alberta to determine potential outcome differences in management strategies.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 520 patients diagnosed with cervical spine fractures over a six-year period from January 1990, through December 1996. Patients were identified through the medical records database of the two Level 1 trauma facilities, on the basis of ICD-9 diagnostic coding.
Results: 
Ninety-three fractures of the odontoid process were identified, of which 85 were acute and eight were chronic. There were 57 Type II (67%) and 27 Type III (32%) acute odontoid fractures. Of these, 64 were managed conservatively (bracing), whereas 20 were treated surgically. Thirteen patients underwent anterior screw fixation, seven patients had posterior cervical fusion. Eleven patients died in the acute phase, two as a result of their high cervical cord injury and nine from unrelated medical causes. Fifty-six of the remaining 82 patients (68%) were located with a minimum of three months follow-up (range three months to eight years). Satisfactory results were obtained in 76% of all acute patients treated by bracing, but only 50% in those over the age of 65. In the surgically managed group, all patients (100%) went on to develop stable fusions.
Conclusions: 
Our results indicate that while conservative management of odontoid fractures with external bracing results in fracture healing in most cases, surgical fusion may provide superior rates of bony union with acceptable morbidity. This difference in outcome lends itself to formal investigation through a prospective randomized trial.},

A multicenter concurrent study evaluated 59 patients--22 managed operatively and 37 nonoperatively. The two groups were compared for neurologic outcome, complications, mortality, and length of stay. The results indicated that patients in the nonoperative group had a significantly shorter length of stay and, therefore, a significantly lower cost of care. No other differences between operative and nonoperative groups were identified in regard to other outcome variables. Results of descriptive analyses of patient characteristics and treatment choices have significant implications for practitioners.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Bone cement augmentation procedures (vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty) are the primary treatments for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF). However, these procedures are associated with various problems resulting in subsequent fracture. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the spinal instability factors related to subsequent fracture after vertebral augmentation procedures.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent augmentation procedures for osteoporotic VCF. Between May 2011 and November 2014, 285 patients (vertebroplasty, n = 231; kyphoplasty, n = 54) were enrolled. Subsequent fractures were classified into 4 types based on the fracture patterns: 1) no subsequent fracture, 2) neofracture, 3) hammer fracture (new vertebral fractures involving another vertebra without a definitive history of trauma), and 4) kyphotic compression fracture. We analyzed subsequent fracture patterns and their occurrence rates according to factors that may induce subsequent fracture and developed a predictive scoring system with respect to the hammer fracture occurrence rate. We classified all cases into 4 groups (A,B,C,D) according to Spinal Instability Predictive Scoring System score. Groups A, B, C, and D were defined by total scores of 0∼5, 6∼10, 11∼15, and 16∼20, respectively.
Results: 
The subsequent fracture types for vertebroplasty were as follows: no subsequent fracture (n = 112; 48.28%); hammer fracture (n = 65; 28.02%); neofracture (n = 35; 15.09%); and kyphotic compression fracture (n = 19; 8.19%). According to the total scores, the occurrence rate of subsequent hammer fracture (no subsequent fracture, hammer fracture, neofracture, and kyphotic compression fracture) were as follows: group A (84.21%, 0%, 10.52%, and 5.26%), group B (64.58%, 10.45%, 12.5%, and 12.5%), group C (39.39%, 33.3%, 15.15%, and 12.12%), and group D (11.67%, 63.3%, 21.67%, and 3.33%).
Conclusions: 
Predictive scores can be calculated and used to predict the possibility of subsequent fracture according to scores. Group D showed the highest predictive scores and will need more preventative treatment.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective case series review of patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing elective spine surgery at a single tertiary referral center.
Objectives: 
To assess the rate of complications of spine surgery in the population with Parkinson's disease and characterize the causes of failure and special needs of this unique population.
Summary of background data: 
Patients with Parkinson's disease experience a combination of poor bone quality and a severe neuromuscular disorder. There is little information in the literature about outcomes of spine surgery in this population. Preliminary review suggests that these patients have a high rate of instrument-related complications that has not been reported previously.
Methods: 
A computerized search using diagnostic and procedural codes identified 14 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent spine surgery from January 1993 through December 2000. Their charts and radiographs were reviewed, and those not examined within twelve months were invited for follow-up review. The remaining patients were being followed on a regular basis by their spine surgeon, the Movement Disorders Clinic, or both and were seen and examined during their routine follow-up observation. INDICATIONS AND EXTENT OF INDEX SURGERY VARIED: Complications, revisions, and radiographic evidence of loosening were assessed. Causes of failure were sought with respect to surgical and clinical factors. All patients underwent surgical care by a fellowship-trained spine surgeon.
Results: 
The mean follow-up period from index procedure was 66.8 months; the median follow-up period was 38 months. Of 14 patients, 12 (86%) required additional surgery, undergoing a total of 31 reoperations. Eleven patients (79%) underwent 22 additional procedures at the same or adjacent level for instability, including four patients (29%) who had hardware failure or pullout, necessitating 10 reoperations. The one other patient who required additional surgery had a successful index procedure but underwent another operation to address instability at a remote spinal segment. Of five patients whose index procedure involved only one spinal level, three (60%) required additional procedures, all at that level. Two patients (14%) developed wound infections during the course of treatment but not as the cause of initial treatment failure. The primary mechanisms of failure were relentless kyphosis or segmental instability at the operated-on or adjacent levels.
Conclusion: 
Patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing spine surgery in a single tertiary referral center had a very high reoperation rate associated with technical complications. Patients should be appropriately counseled regarding the increased risk of operative complications and closely followed for incipient failure.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a spreading epidural hematoma (SEH) and deep subcutaneous edema (DSE) as indirect signs of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries on MR imaging of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Materials and methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed spinal MR images of 43 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures: 17 patients with PLC injuries (study group) and 26 without PLC injuries (control group). An SEH was defined as a hemorrhagic infiltration into the anterior or posterior epidural space that spread along more than three vertebrae including the level of the fracture. A DSE was regarded as a fluid-like signal lesion in the deep subcutaneous layer of the back, and its epicenter was at the burst fracture level. The frequency of the SEH/DSE in the two groups was analyzed. In addition, the association between each sign and the degree of vertebral collapse, the severity of central canal compromise, and surgical decisions were analyzed.
Results: 
Magnetic resonance images showed an SEH in 20 out of 43 patients (46%) and a DSE in 17 (40%). The SEH and DSE were more commonly seen in the study group with PLC injuries (SEH, 15 out of 17 patients, 80%; DSE, 16 out of 17 patients, 94%) than in the control group without PLC injuries (SEH, 5 out of 26, 19%; DSE, 1 out of 26, 4%) (P <0.0001). The SEH and DSE were significantly associated with surgical management decisions (17 out of 20 patients with SEH, 85%, vs 8 out of the 23 without SEH, 35%, P =0.002; 15 out of 17 with DSE, 88%, vs 10 out of 26 without DSE, 38%, P =0.002). The SEH and DSE did not correlate with the degree of vertebral collapse or the severity of central canal compromise.
Conclusion: 
The SEH and DSE may be useful secondary MR signs of posterior ligamentous complex injury in thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The aim of this study is to evaluate results of a standalone percutaneous posterior plating of the vertically unstable sacral fractures, to analyze the influencing factors, to discuss encountered complications, and to express the related recommendations.
Methods: 
Forty two cases were included; all of them had type C vertical sacral fractures; and 16 cases had associated nerve roots injury. Subcutaneous 3.5-mm reconstruction plate was used in all cases, through vertical incisions in 28 cases and transverse incisions in 14 cases. Hannover pelvic outcome scoring system was implemented for results evaluation.
Results: 
The mean follow-up period was 22.1 ± 7.5 months; the mean operative time was 43.3 ± 7 min; the mean surgical incision length was 4.6 ± 1.1 cm. 14 cases had excellent scores, 16 cases had good scores, 6 cases had fair scores, and 6 cases had poor scores. Younger age groups had significantly better outcome (P = 0.015), whereas the comminuted sacrum had significantly worse score (P = 0.041). Final residual posterior displacements significantly improved (P = 0.001) in comparison to the initial displacement. The nerve roots injury had final significant recovery (P = 0.012). Transverse skin incisions had subjectively significant satisfaction (P = 0.017).
Conclusions: 
Percutaneous 3.5-mm reconstruction plate is a good alternative to percutaneous iliosacral screws in vertically unstable sacral fractures; especially in the presence of contraindication to the latter. It is simple procedure with minimal incisions; short operative time; less radiological exposure; good mechanical stability; and less iatrogenic injuries.},

To assess the effectiveness and safety of stentoplasty in people with osteoporotic vertebral body fractures.

Clinical trials and observational studies that included alive adults with osteoporotic vertebral body fractures and the comparators were the intervention himself, vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty were selected. Quality of evidence was graded according to the GRADE approach. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Forty-two citations were identified during the search. After removing duplicates, five studies were included: two clinical trials and three observational studies. Stentoplasty, showed higher rate of adverse events related to material (P=0.043) and cuff pressure (P=0.014) in comparison to kyphoplasty. There was no difference between two procedures in terms of reduction of kyphosis, time of exposure to radiation or postoperative loss of cement. Stentoplasty in comparison to vertebroplasty, showed an improvement of restoration of vertebral height (P=0.042), kyphosis correction and volume of bone cement. No differences were found between two procedures in terms of loss of vertebral body volume. Based on observational studies, stentoplasty improved vertebral height, pain and functional disability at 6 and 12months follow-up, and corrected the angle vertebral fractures in patients with osteoporotic vertebral body. Stentoplasty was presented as a safe procedure in short-medium term, with a low complication rate, a reduced loss of cement and new vertebral body fractures lower rates. Stentoplasty improves vertebral height, reduces the pain and functional disability and correct the vertebral angle in patients with osteoporotic vertebral body fracture with minimum adverse events. Stentoplasty is comparable to kyphoplasty in terms of correction of kyphosis, time of exposure to radiation and cement postoperative loss, and comparable to vertebroplasty in terms of restoration of vertebral height correction and bone cement volume.

  abstract={Purpose: 
Balloon kyphoplasty is currently widely used for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Procedure safety is directly linked to precise radiological imaging generated by various X-ray systems (C-arm, O-arm, angiography table, etc.). This minimally invasive spinal surgery is, by definition, associated with significant radiation exposure for both patient and surgeon. Real dose exposure received by the surgeon is usually difficult to precisely record. In our center, all Balloon Kyphoplasty Procedures (BKP) are now performed using an O-arm image guidance system to control cement augmentation in VCF. Our preliminary experience described reduced dose exposure compared to C-arm guided procedures. We present here an additional way to considerably reduce the amount of radiation received by the surgeon during BKP using a new injection system.
Methods: 
We prospectively evaluated O-arm guided BKP in 20 consecutive patients alternatively allocated to either classic O-arm BKP with direct bone filler injection or BKP using a new Cement Delivery System (CDS). Eye, wrist, finger and leg measurements were taken bilaterally and compared between the two groups.
Results: 
The radiation dose received by the surgeon's finger, wrist and leg was reduced by greater than 80% when using the CDS. It allows the surgeon to work way below the most severe annual limit of dose exposure, which may not be the case when using a classical bone filler direct injection mechanism.
Conclusion: 
We believe that when using this new intraoperative injection system, the surgeon's overall anatomic exposure is significantly reduced without compromising the critical procedure steps.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Systematic review of literature and expert clinical opinions of the members of the Spine Trauma Study Group were combined to develop and refine this algorithm.
Objective: 
To develop an evidence-based algorithm for surgical approaches to manage subaxial cervical injuries using a systematic review of the literature, expert opinion, and anticipated patient preferences.
Summary of background data: 
There is lack of consensus in the management of subaxial cervical spine trauma, in part, because of the lack of a clinically relevant system for classifying these injuries. The newly developed Subaxial Injury Classification scoring system categorizes injury morphology into 3 broad groups, includes an assessment of the integrity of the discoligamentous soft tissue structures and the patient's neurologic status, and thus guides surgical or nonsurgical treatment. The choice of a specific surgical technique and approach is currently not evidence based, and this gap in knowledge is one which the current article seeks to address.
Methods: 
A literature review followed by a consensus of experts approach was used to develop the algorithm and to ensure face and content validity.
Results: 
An algorithm is presented to guide the choice of surgical approach in cervical subaxial burst fractures, distraction injuries, and translation or rotation injuries. The burst or compression injuries and distraction injuries are more likely to be treated with a single anterior approach, whereas the more severe translation or rotation injuries may more commonly be approached posteriorly or with combined anterior and posterior surgery.
Conclusion: 
This algorithm; derived from the Subaxial Injury Classification scoring system, will assist surgeons in answering the 2 most common questions they face when managing subaxial cervical spine trauma: "Should I operate?" and "Which surgical approach should I select?"},

  abstract={Odontoid fractures account for approximately 20% of all cervical fractures, with the majority being type II fractures according to the Anderson and D'Alonzo classification. The treatment of odontoid fractures is determined by multiple factors, including fracture type, presence of associated injuries, patient age, and patient comorbidities. It is generally well accepted that type I and type III injuries heal well with non-operative treatment. However, some type I injuries can be seen in association with occipito-atlantal dislocation; and some type III fractures can be closer to the neck of the odontoid (high and shallow based), and may act like a type II fracture, that is, with an increased probability of nonunion. The treatment of type II fractures remains controversial. Over the past decade, internal fixation has become an accepted treatment for unstable injuries of the cervical spine. Multiple surgical approaches have been proposed. This article reviews the various alternatives for treating odontoid fractures, attempting to give to the reader a broad perspective on the current techniques, including information taken from evidence-based medicine.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare clinical and radiographic parameters and outcomes in patients undergoing anterior vs. posterior surgery in unstable cervical subaxial spine fractures.
Methods: 
We analyzed a group of 33 patients with reducible cervical subaxial fractures. Patients underwent anterior or posterior cervical instrumentation. Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed, and the multiple pre-operative and post-operative clinical and radiographic factors were recorded and analyzed.
Results: 
Posterior cervical fixation was performed in 15 patients, and anterior cervical fixation in 18 patients. Operative time, blood loss, and number of levels instrumented were all significantly less in the anterior than the posterior cervical group. There was no difference in patient age, surgical complications, follow-up ASIA score, Rand SF-36 evaluation, or cost analysis between the two groups. Mean follow-up time was 11.8±7 months. All patients achieved bony fusion and good alignment at follow-up.
Conclusions: 
In patients with reducible cervical subaxial dislocations, posterior cervical fixation entails a larger number of fused segments. Anterior surgery is associated with shorter operative times and less blood loss. Anterior instrumentation with interbody grafting can be the initial choice of treatment for stabilization for this subgroup of patients. Posterior surgery is indicated if radiographs after anterior instrumentation show failure.},

  abstract={Intrtoduction: 
Osteoporotic vertebral collapse (OVC) with delayed neurological deficits (DND) is one severe subtype of OVC, for which surgical intervention is more complicated and difficult. Although many individual case reports and series have described the surgery for stabilization and neurological decompression of OVC with DND, no systematic review has been published.
Methods: 
We searched eligible studies in PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE and ISIWeb of Knowledge for eligible studies and conducted comprehensive analysis.
Results: 
A total of 29 publications involving 596 patients of OVC with DND were included in this review. There are 36.6%, 60.6% and 2.8% of patients receiving anterior neural decompression and reconstruction, posterior surgery which can be further divided into 6 distinct groups, and posteroanterior surgery, respectively. Among them, patients in the posteroanterior surgery had the longest time (351.0 min) for operation and the largest volume of mean blood loss (2892.0 ml). For clinical outcomes, patients in the posterior spinal shortening osteotomy with direct neural decompression group had the most significantly LKA correction effect, with mean LKA correction 21.3°, while the posterior decompression and posterior column reconstruction group exhibited the lowest LKA correction loss rate (14.7%).
Conclusion: 
Although the optimal treatment has not been determined for patients of OVC with DND in this study, our analysis could provide guidance for choosing an appropriate approach. Besides, effective treatment for OVC with DND requires multidisciplinary collaboration, such as geriatricians, interventional radiologists, respiratory disease experts, and spine surgeons. On light of the above analysis, we believe that individualized surgical approach should be introduced based on the clinical characteristics of each patient.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
The complex anatomy of the cervicothoracic junction region makes a reliable assessment of plain radiographs in lateral projection difficult or even impossible, which may result in failure to detect fracture or other pathology in this region of the spine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patients with spinal disorders in the region of the seventh cervical to the third thoracic vertebrae treated at our department.
Material: 
During the period from November 2001 to June 2004, 34 patients with disorders of the C7-T3 region were treated surgically at the Department of Spinal Surgery, Motol Teaching Hospital, which accounted for 2.1% of the 1537 patients treated for spinal diseases in this period. Instability of the cervicothoracic junction was caused by tumors in 15 and by injury in 14 patients. Other diagnoses included deformity associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in two patients, spondylodiscitis in one, and hemivertebral deformity at C7 and T1, each in one patient. The group included 16 women and 18 men between 8 and 75 years, with the mean of 52.3 years (after excluding the two children with hemivertebral deformity aged 8 and 9 years, respectively). The trauma subgroup had a significantly lower mean age (43.6 years) than the tumor subgroup (59.9 years).
Methods: 
We placed the patients in three groups according to the etiology of cervicothoracic junction disorder, namely, 1. tumors and spondylodiscitis; 2. injuries; 3. others. Group 1 included 16 patients, 15 with tumors and one with spondylodiscitis. Two patients were treated by dorsal stabilization, one by ventral stabilization and the rest underwent combined surgery. Of 14 patients in group 2, three were treated from the posterior approach, six from the anterior approach and five by the combined approach. All group 3 patients underwent surgery from the posterior approach, with two patients being treated without instrumentation.
Results: 
Of the 34 patients, only 33 were included; one was lost to follow-up soon after the operation. In group 1, no excellent, five very good, five satisfactory and two unsatisfactory outcomes were recorded. No intraoperative complications such as injury to the major vessels or nerve structures occurred; in one patient, profuse bleeding from arteries supplying a metastatic tumor had to be arrested. Late complications included loosening of the dorsal instrumentation in two patients, who required repeat operations. In group 2, there were six excellent, four good, two satisfactory and one poor outcomes. Late complications in one patient included loosening of the ventral instrumentation, followed by repeat surgery. Group 3 showed two excellent and two satisfactory outcomes; the latter were in the RA patients. Late complications involved one loosening of the dorsal instrumentation requiring repeat surgery. No injury to the major vessels or nerve structures was recorded in either group 2 or group 3. No deep infection was recorded in any of the three groups.
Discussion: 
The results of our evaluation are in agreement with those of other authors and, similarly to them, we had to deal with the difficult issues of diagnosis. Currently, we prefer, in addition to conventional X-ray examination, CT scans including sagittal and frontal reconstruction, recently completed with magnetic resonance imaging, in all patients with cervicothoracic junction disorders. This policy allows us to avoid delays in making correct diagnosis and to provide conditions for effective treatment. In stabilization from the posterior approach we use rod-screw fixation that, in the majority of cases, is not combined with thoracic fixation. Previously, we have inserted screws in the articular processes at the C7 level, but now we prefer transpedicular fixation. Complicated anterior surgical procedures, such as complete or partial sternotomy, are always performed with the assistance of a thoracic surgeon. A noticeably high number of patients with neurological deficit was seen also in our group. Postoperative care is always provided in cooperation with the spinal unit of our hospital. Intensive inter-disciplinary cooperation has an important role in that our patients have a minimum of complications in comparison with the literature data.
Conclusions: 
Injuries and diseases of the spine at the cervicothoracic junction present a complex issue with a high potential for mistakes and complications. The principle of success lies in a high-quality X-ray examination, CT scans with sagittal and frontal reconstruction, and magnetic resonance imaging of the region affected. The complex anatomy of that region requires demanding surgical procedures, which can be performed only by a highly qualified and specialized team with appropriate facilities.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
In general, osteoporotic vertebral collapse (OVC) with neurological deficits requires sufficient decompression of neural tissues to restore function level in activities of daily living (ADL). However, it remains unclear as to which procedure provides better neurological recovery. The primary purpose of this study was to compare neurological recovery among three typical procedures for OVC with neurological deficits. Secondary purpose was to compare postoperative ADL function.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed data for 88 patients (29 men and 59 women) with OVC and neurological deficits who underwent surgery. Three typical kinds of surgical procedures with different decompression methods were used: (1) anterior direct neural decompression and reconstruction (AR group: 27 patients), (2) posterior spinal shorting osteotomy with direct neural decompression (PS group: 36 patients), and (3) posterior indirect neural decompression and short-segment spinal fusion combined with vertebroplasty (VP group: 25 patients). We examined clinical results regarding neurological deficits and function level in ADL and radiological results.
Results: 
The mean improvement rates for neurological deficits and ADL function level were 60.1 and 55.0%, respectively. There were no significant differences among three groups in improvement rates for neurological deficits or ADL function level. The VP group had a significantly lower estimated mean blood loss (338 mL) and mean duration of surgery (229 min) than both the AR and PS groups (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
Direct neural decompression is not always necessary, and the majority of patients can be treated with a less-invasive procedure such as short-segment posterior spinal fusion with indirect decompression combined with vertebroplasty. The high-priority issue is careful evaluation of patients' general health and osteoporosis severity, so that the surgeon can choose the procedure best suited for each patient.},

  abstract={Background: 
Fractures of the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra can result in instability, neurological damage and death. Treatment includes conservative management (external immobilisation devices) or surgical treatment (internal fixation by posterior fusion or anterior screw fixation).
Objectives: 
To compare surgical with conservative treatment for fractures of the odontoid process.
Search strategy: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), EMBASE (1988 to February 2008), LILACS (accessed February 2008), reference lists of articles and registries of ongoing trials.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus conservative management of odontoid fractures.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors independently examined the search results to identify trials for inclusion.
Main results: 
We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. We excluded one ongoing and registered study that is comparing surgery versus conservative treatment because it does not involve randomisation of treatment allocation.
Authors' conclusions: 
There is no evidence available from adequately controlled trials to inform the decision on whether the surgical treatment of odontoid fractures gives a better outcome. A sufficiently powered good quality multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment is warranted.},

  abstract={Background: 
Pedicle fractures in the cervical spine are common. They may occur in isolation or in combination with other concomitant fractures. Multiple classification systems have been introduced to provide a clinical framework when approaching these types of fractures; however, these systems do not provide guidelines for optimal treatment. Data regarding decision making are limited. Conservative treatment with orthoses may result in subluxation and instability requiring further treatment. Surgery may not be required in all instances because many of these injuries may heal without surgical intervention.
Methods: 
All cases of cervical fractures treated at a single institution over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Cases with pedicle fractures were further evaluated, and 40 cases managed either with or without surgery were identified. Data on presenting history, neurologic examination, imaging findings, comorbidity, method of treatment, complication rate, and length of hospital stay were collected. Fractures were classified based on computed tomography scans. Data on associated injuries were also collected. Fusion rate and fracture displacement were assessed by plain radiographs and computed tomography scans at follow-up. Follow-up time points included 2, 6, and 12 weeks and 6 months after injury. Primary outcome was fracture healing regardless of modality in the absence of progressive deformity (i.e., listhesis, kyphosis) and need for further surgery.
Results: 
Conservative therapy was administered to 26 patients, and 14 patients underwent surgery. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of total levels injured (P = 0.9) or injury severity score (P = 0.5). Patients who presented with intact neurologic status were more likely to be treated conservatively (88% vs. 29%; P = 0.0004), whereas patients presenting with spinal cord injuries were more likely to undergo surgical fixation (35% vs. 0%; P = 0.0004). Length of hospital stay trended toward being significantly greater in patients who underwent surgery (10.6 days vs. 5.5 days; P = 0.07). According to our classification system, the most common fracture type was single line horizontal fracture occurring in 68% (27 of 40 cases). Vertical split pedicle fracture occurred in 28% (11 of 40 cases), and double line horizontal fracture occurred in 5% (2 of 40 cases). Posttreatment progressive listhesis was significantly higher in patients who were treated conservatively (31% vs. 0%; P = 0.03), especially when associated with comminuted lateral mass or subluxation or both.
Conclusions: 
This study describes and classifies unique cervical pedicle fractures and associated injuries. Our findings suggest that surgical treatment results in definitive stability for these injuries compared with conservative therapy, particularly for pedicle fractures associated with comminuted lateral mass or initially displaced fractures. However, nondisplaced vertical split pedicle fractures and isolated single line horizontal fractures may be treated nonsurgically without occurrence of further instability. A larger prospective study is required to confirm these findings.},

  abstract={Background: 
Type II odontoid fractures with additional chip fragments are rare in clinical practice, accounting for < 10% of all odontoid fractures. Hadley et al were the first to describe these fractures as an individual subtype (IIA).
Objective: 
To analyze the outcome of patients after surgical or nonoperative treatment of Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures.
Methods: 
We analyzed the records of 46 patients at an average of 64 years of age at the time of injury. Twenty-five patients underwent surgical stabilization by anterior screw fixation and were entered into study group A; 21 patients were treated nonoperatively by halo vest immobilization and included in study group B.
Results: 
Thirty-seven patients (84%) returned to their preinjury activity level and were satisfied with their treatment. Using the Cervical Spine Outcomes Questionnaire to quantify the clinical outcome, we had an overall outcome score of 21.8. We did not find a significant difference in the overall clinical outcome between study groups. Bony fusion was achieved in 35 patients (80%). We had a nonunion rate of 13% after anterior screw fixation and a significantly higher rate of 30% after halo vest immobilization. Failure of reduction or fixation occurred in 12 patients (27%), with a significantly higher failure rate after halo vest immobilization.
Conclusion: 
Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures are inherently unstable and impede proper realignment. These fractures have a significantly increased risk for secondary loss of reduction and bony nonunion, particularly after nonoperative management. Early surgery should be considered to avoid further complications.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Observational study.
Objective: 
Examine the overall survival and treatment costs from a third-party-payer perspective for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) treated by vertebral augmentation or conservative treatment in Germany.
Summary of background data: 
OVCFs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and thus reduced quality of life. Vertebral augmentation has been shown to be effective in these fractures. The association between treatment and survivorship as well as cost per life year gained for balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was analyzed in the Medicare population. Replication of these analyses is warranted for confidence in findings.
Methods: 
Claims data from a major health insurance fund were used. Mortality risk differences between operated (BKP, PVP) and nonoperated cohorts were assessed by Cox regression. Operated patient groups were established by propensity score matching adjusting for covariates. For the matched operated patients with OVCF, (2006-2010) survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: 
A total of 598 newly diagnosed patients with OVCF were operated of 3607 patients with OVCF. The operated cohort was 43% less likely to die than the nonoperated one in the 5-year study period (hazard ratio = 0.57; P < 0.001). Patients who received BKP had higher 60-month adjusted survival rate (66.7%) than those who received PVP (58.7%) (P = 0.68). Cumulative 4-year mean overall costs after first diagnosis were lower for the BKP cohort (PVP: €42,510 vs. BKP: €39,014). Initial upfront higher costs driven by surgical treatment for patients who received BKP are offset by considerable pharmacy costs in patients who received PVP. There were differences between the values of painkiller consumption (PVP: €3321 vs. BKP: €2224).
Conclusion: 
Results suggest a higher overall survival rate for operated than nonoperated patients with OVCF and indicate a potential survival benefit for patients who received BKP compared with patients who received PVP. The reasons merit further investigation. Total costs were lower after 4 years for patients who received BKP versus PVP due to less consumption of pharmaceuticals.
Level of evidence: 
3.},

  abstract={Background: 
Odontoid fractures are the most common cervical spine fracture in the geriatric population; however, the treatment of type II odontoid fractures in this age group is controversial.
Objective: 
To compare the short-term (<3 months) mortality, long-term (≥12 months) mortality, and complication rates of patients >60 years of age with a type II odontoid fracture managed either operatively or nonoperatively.
Methods: 
We performed a systematic review of literature published between January 1, 2000, and February 1, 2015, related to the treatment of type II odontoid fractures in patients >60 years of age. An analysis of short-term mortality, long-term mortality, and the occurrence of complications was performed.
Results: 
A total of 452 articles were identified, of which 21 articles with 1233 patients met the inclusion criteria. Short-term mortality (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.63) and long-term mortality (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.64) were lower in patients who underwent surgical treatment than in those who had nonsurgical treatment, and there were no significant differences in the rate of complications (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.63). Surgical approach (posterior vs anterior) showed no significant difference in mortality or complication rate. Similarly, no difference in mortality or complication rate was identified with hard collar or a halo orthosis immobilization.
Conclusion: 
The current literature suggests that well-selected patients >60 years of age undergoing surgical treatment for a type II odontoid fracture have a decreased risk of short-term and long-term mortality without an increase in the risk of complications.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The aim of this study was to compare the unilateral and bilateral approaches in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
Based on the principles and methods of the Cochrane systematic reviews, the records of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese Bio-medicine database, China Journal Full-text Database, VIP database, and Wanfang database were reviewed until October 2014. The randomized controlled trials on unilateral and bilateral approaches to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP)/percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were included. The risk of bias of included trials was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version. The RevMan Software 5.0 was used for meta-analysis.
Results: 
Fifteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 850 patients were included. Risk of bias in the included studies was inevitable. There was no statistically significant difference in visual analog scale, vertebral height, kyphotic angular, and quality of life. The main operative complications were bone cement leakage and adjacent vertebral fracture, without difference between the two groups.
Conclusions: 
In view of the current evidence, there is insufficient evidence to show any difference between the unilateral and bilateral approaches in both the PVP and PKP treatment in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Level of evidence: 
Level I, Therapeutic study.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous access to the vertebral bodies is commonly done via the transpedicular approach for both diagnoses and treatment of spinal pathology. While this approach is effective in most cases, it is difficult in certain situations such as a patient with obstructing hardware from prior surgery.
Objectives: 
To investigate and illustrate an alternative to the typical percutaneous access to the vertebral body via an extrapedicular approach and to determine the complications associated with this approach.
Study design: 
Description of a novel percutaneous vertebral body access technique developed during cadaver dissection and a report of complication rates in cases that were performed using this technique.
Setting: 
Radiology department at a private institution.
Methods: 
An effective extrapedicular access technique that could safely and consistently allow the needle tip to be placed in the center of the vertebral body was developed from cadaver dissection observations for the purpose of clinical use. A total of 96 vertebral compression fractures from T5 to L5 were treated via the extrapedicular technique at our institution between July 2008 and August 2012. There were 72 patients between ages 27 and 98 (mean age 73.2 years) who underwent treatment.
Results: 
Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively avascular and aneural portion of the inferior vertebral body just anterior to the pedicle. A total of 96 vertebral fractures were treated using the extrapedicular technique without any recognized clinical complications from the needle access or the instrumentation.
Limitations: 
The trial included a relatively small sample size, representing 7.4 percent of total patients treated at our institution. This was likely the result of a smaller patient population with contraindications to typical transpedicular access.
Conclusions: 
The thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies may be accessed using a percutaneous extrapedicular access technique which represents a relatively avascular and aneural approach to the vertebral body. The technique presented allows access to the vertebral body around existing hardware and can accommodate the placement of large instruments. This technique was not associated with any known complications in our series of patients.Key words: Vertebral body, spine, extrapedicular, kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, paraspinal, thoracic, lumbar.},

  abstract={Aim of the study was to "in vivo" measure temperature, during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV), within a vertebral body injected with different bone cements. According to the declaration of Helsinki, 22 women (60-80 years; mean, 75 years) with painful osteoporotic vertebral collapse underwent bilateral transpedicular PV on 22 lumbar vertebrae. Two 10-G vertebroplasty needles were introduced into the vertebra under digital fluoroscopy; a 16-G radiofrequency thermoablation needle (Starburst XL; RITA Medical System Inc., USA), carrying five thermocouples, was than coaxially inserted. Eleven different bone cements were injected and temperatures were measured every 30 s until temperatures dropped under 45 degrees C. After the thermocouple needle was withdrawn, bilateral PV was completed with cement injection through the vertebroplasty needle. Unpaired Student's t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to evaluate significant differences (p < 0.05) in peak temperatures, variations between cements, and clinical outcome. All procedures were completed without complications, achieving good clinical outcomes (p < 0.0001). Regarding average peak temperature, cements were divided into three groups: A (over 60 degrees C), B (from 50 degrees to 60 degrees C), and C (below 50 degrees C). Peak temperature in Group A (86.7 +/- 10.7 degrees C) was significantly higher (p = 0.0172) than that in Groups B (60.5 +/- 3.7 degrees C) and C (44.8 +/- 2.6 degrees C). The average of all thermocouples showed an extremely significant difference (p = 0.0002) between groups. None of the tested cements maintained a temperature >or=45 degrees C for more than 30 min. These data suggest that back-pain improvement is obtained not by thermal necrosis but by mechanical consolidation only. The relative necrotic thermal effect in vertebral metastases seems to confirm that analgesia must be considered the main intent of PV.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Recurrent pain after vertebroplasty is relatively common, usually representing a new fracture at a different vertebral level. In a small cohort described herein, clinical and imaging findings indicated that recurrent pain arose from abnormality of the previously treated level. Our purpose was to demonstrate that repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty performed within the same fractured vertebra can offer therapeutic benefit for patients with recurrent pain after initial treatment.
Methods: 
We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive vertebroplasty procedures performed at our institution to define a patient population that underwent repeat vertebroplasty for recurrent pain at previously treated vertebral levels. We identified six such patients over an 8-year period, and clinical outcomes were assessed through quantitative measurements of pre- and postoperative levels of pain and mobility.
Results: 
Initial vertebroplasty resulted in substantial improvement in pain in all six patients. Patients developed recurrent pain between 8 days and 167 days after initial vertebroplasty. After repeat vertebroplasty, five of the six patients reported a reduction of at least 3 points in their rating of pain, with a mean reduction of 6.5 points and a mean postoperative pain level of 3.5 points (11-point scale). Four of six patients reported impaired mobility before repeat vertebroplasty, and all four demonstrated a postoperative improvement in mobility. Mean increase in mobility was 1.50 points, and the mean postoperative mobility impairment was 0.25 points (5-point scale).
Conclusion: 
The clinical outcomes of the patients within this case series suggest that repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty performed at previously treated vertebral levels for recurrent pain offer therapeutic benefit.},

Stabilization plays an important role in fracture treatment, but appropriate instrumentation systems for endoscopic circumstances are lacking. Therefore a new thoracoscopically implantable stabilization system for thoracolumbar fracture treatment was developed and its biomechanical in vitro properties were compared. In a biomechanical in vitro study, burst fracture stabilization was simulated and anterior short fixation devices were tested under load with pure moments to evaluate the biomechanical stabilizing characteristics of the new system in comparison with a currently available system. With interbody graft and fixation the new system demonstrated higher stabilizing effects in flexion/extension and lateral bending and restored axial stability beyond the intact spine, as well as having comparable or improved effects compared with the current system. Because of this biomechanical characterization a clinical trial is warranted; the usefulness of the new system has already been demonstrated in 45 patients in our department and more than 300 cases in a multicenter study which is currently under way.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Kyphoplasty immediately improves pain and mobility in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but long-term clinical outcomes are still unclear. This controlled trial evaluates pain, mobility and fracture incidence 3 years after kyphoplasty.
Materials and methods: 
Kyphoplasty was performed in 40 patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; 20 patients who were selected for kyphoplasty but chose not to undergo the procedure served as controls. All patients received pharmacologic antiosteoporosis treatment, pain medication, and physiotherapy. Pain (visual analog scale of 0-100), mobility (European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study questionnaire score of 0-100), and incident vertebral fractures were assessed at baseline, postprocedurally, and after 12 and 36 months.
Results: 
Pain score improved after kyphoplasty from 73.8 to 55.9 (immediately after kyphoplasty), 55.6 (12 months), and 54.0 (36 months; P < .001). Pain score in the control group changed from 66.4 to 65.7 at 12 months and 64.0 at 36 months (P = .521). The pain score of the kyphoplasty group was significantly improved versus controls after 36 months (P = .023). Mobility score improved after kyphoplasty from 43.8 to 54.2 (immediately after kyphoplasty), 54.5 (12 months), and 54.8 (36 months; P = .0008) and remained increased (P = .308) compared with controls (39.8 immediately after kyphoplasty, 44.3 at 12 months, and 43.6 at 36 months). The incidence of new vertebral fractures after kyphoplasty was significantly reduced versus controls after 3 years (P = .0341).
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty reduces pain and improves mobility as long as 3 years after the procedure. The long-term risk of new vertebral fractures after kyphoplasty of chronically painful vertebral fractures is reduced versus controls.},

Optimal timing of stabilization for spinal injuries is discussed controversially. The goal of this study is to investigate the neurological recovery and its influencing factors in thoracolumbar spine fractures after surgical decompression and stabilization within 8 h of spinal cord injury versus surgery which is performed between 3 and 15 days.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven patients undergoing thoracolumbar stabilization with neurological deficit for an acute thoracolumbar spinal injury at the level of Th8-L2 vertebra at Selcuk University between March 2004 and December 2006 were recorded. Patients with neurological deficit and medically stable for surgery underwent immediate stabilization within 8 h defined as group I (n = 12) and patients underwent operation in 3-15 days after thoracolumbar injury were defined as group II (n = 15). Patients were assessed for neurologic deficit and improvement as defined by the scoring system of American spinal injury association (ASIA).
Results: 
In spite of comparable demographic data, patients in group I had a significantly shorter overall hospital and intensive care unit stay and had lesser systemic complications such as pneumonia and also exhibited better neurological improvement than group II (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Early surgery may improve neurological recovery and decrease hospitalization time and also additional systemic complications in patients with thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries. Thus early stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures within 8 h after trauma appears to be favorable.},

To report experience with transverse sacral fracture, an uncommon injury frequently associated with neurologic deficit, and to perform a meta-analysis of the literature in order to define the role of decompression for the management of sacral fractures.
Design: 
A review of 7 cases.
Setting: 
A university-affiliated tertiary care centre.
Patients: 
Seven patients with transverse fractures of the sacrum. The mean follow-up was 13 months.
Interventions: 
A review of the clinical data and a search of the literature for studies that reported on 4 or more patients with a transverse sacral fracture.
Main outcome measures: 
Mechanism of injury, type of neurologic deficit and its management.
Results: 
The most common mechanism in the 7 study patients was a fall from a height. Six patients had neurologic deficits, mostly in the form of bowel or bladder disturbance. Five of these were treated with surgical decompression, and 4 of them had an improvement in neurologic function. The 7 original studies from the literature dealt with a total of 55 patients. As in the study patients, falls from a height and motor vehicle accidents predominated as the mechanisms of injury. In contrast to patients in this study, 20 of 48 patients in the literature review with neurologic deficits were treated conservatively.
Conclusions: 
The outcomes in this study are similar to those reported in the literature. The place of surgical decompression for patients with neurologic deficit cannot be clearly determined from the evidence currently available.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Traumatic injury of the cervical spine was produced on human cadavers and evaluated with instability tests and radiographs.
Objective: 
To relate traumatic injuries of the cervical spine to instability and patterns of traumatic injury to different levels of impact energy.
Summary of background data: 
Data from young human cadavers are rare in traumatic models of the cervical spine, and instabilities caused by axial compression with different impacts remain unknown.
Methods: 
Fourteen cervical spine specimens (C2-C4) obtained from fresh human cadavers were divided evenly into two groups and subjected to axial compressive impact with 30 J and 50 J impact energy, respectively. Pure moments in flexion-extension, left/right lateral bending, and left/right axial rotation were applied to each specimen before and after trauma. The maximum moment was 2.0 Nm in each case. Ranges of motion and neutral zones were measured using stereophotogrammetry.
Results: 
Ranges of motion and neutral zones for both groups increased after trauma. No bony injury was observed on the radiographs after trauma with 30 J, but motions increased significantly in flexion, extension, and axial rotation. All specimens showed bony injuries after trauma with 50 J, whereas motions continued to increase significantly in all directions. The relative neutral zone values were larger than the corresponding range of motion values, except in flexion-extension after trauma with 50 J.
Conclusions: 
The injury patterns of the cervical spine were associated with impact energy, and a high level of impact energy could produce either three-column injury or anterior middle-column injury. Instabilities of the cervical spine caused by compressive trauma increased with the level of impact energy. The neutral zone was more sensitive than the range of motion in representing spinal instability, whereas instability testing was more sensitive than radiographs in evaluating traumatic injury of cervical spine.},

To evaluate the ideal treatment strategy for traumatic posterior atlantoaxial dislocation without fracture of odontoid process.
Design:

Patients: 
Nineteen patients who suffered from traumatic posterior atlantoaxial dislocation without fracture of odontoid process.
Intervention: 
Closed reduction, open reduction, internal fixation, and fusion.
Outcome measures: 
Neurologic status, range of motion, and radiographs for stability or fusion.
Results: 
Nineteen cases were included in this analysis. The mean age was 37.7 ± 13.8 years (range, 20-65 years). Sixteen cases (84%) were male, and 3 cases (16%) were female. Thirteen cases (68%) have a transient loss of consciousness. Ten cases (53%) presented no neurologic deficits. All 9 patients (47%) with neurologic deficits recovered without any residual deficits. Eleven dislocations (58%) were reduced by closed reduction, followed by fusion in 5 of them (45%), and the remaining 6 dislocations (55%) were treated conservatively. Eight dislocations (42%) were treated by open reduction and fusion.
Conclusions: 
Traumatic posterior atlantoaxial dislocation without fracture of odontoid process usually presents without a severe neurologic deficit. Even if it presents with mild or transient neurologic deficit, it would be restored without any residual deficits. Closed reduction is usually successful and safe. The need for fusion after successful closed reduction depends on the integrity of the transverse ligament and the stability of cervical spine. If anatomic reduction is not achieved by closed reduction, open reduction and fusion should be performed.},

  abstract={Objective: 
The purpose of this study was to determine the treatment features of odontoid fractures with a significant displacement.
Material and methods: 
Thirty-seven patients with acute odontoid fractures were treated in Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital between 1998 and 2003. Seventeen persons with displacement of fragments less than 5 mm or 5 mm (according to E. A. Seybold and J. C. Bayley method) were in the first group. Twenty patients with displacement of fragments more than 5 mm were in the second group. The attempt of closed reduction of the cervical spine axis was performed for all patients. If successful closed reduction was achieved, patients were placed in halo-vest device for 8 weeks. If closed reduction failed, patient was operated according to W. E. Gallie. Postoperatively, all patients wore a halo-vest device during the first 8 weeks.
Results: 
Demographics including age, sex, neurological condition, and associated spinal fractures were similar in patients from these groups (p>0.05). Successful closed reduction of the cervical spine axis was achieved in 11 (64.7%) patients from the first group and in 13 (65%) patients from the second group (p>0.05). Six (35.3%) patients from the first group and seven (35%) from the second group were treated with immediate C1-C2 posterior fusion (p>0.05). Two (16.7%) from twelve patients from the second group were treated by external immobilization by halo-vest device and had nonunion of fracture 8 weeks after the treatment. All operated patients had a solid fusion.
Conclusions: 
If closed reduction of the odontoid fracture with a significant displacement was achieved then external immobilization by halo-vest device can be used. Posterior fusion is the treatment of choice for irreducible odontoid fractures.},

  abstract={Vertebral compression fractures are the most prevalent complication of osteoporosis and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has emerged as a promising addition to the methods of treating the debilitating pain they may cause. Since PVP was first reported in the literature in 1987, more than 600 clinical papers have been published on the subject. Most report excellent improvements in pain relief and quality of life. However, these papers have been based mostly on uncontrolled cohort studies with a wide variety of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In 2009, two high-profile randomised controlled trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine which led care providers throughout the world to question the value of PVP. After more than two decades a number of important questions about the mechanism and the effectiveness of this procedure remain unanswered.},

This study investigates the effects of kyphoplasty on pain and mobility in patients with osteoporosis and painful vertebral fractures compared with conventional medical management.
Introduction: 
Pharmacological treatment of patients with primary osteoporosis does not prevent pain and impaired activity of patients with painful vertebral fractures. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical outcome after kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral fractures and associated chronic pain for >12 months.
Materials and methods: 
Sixty patients with primary osteoporosis and painful vertebral fractures presenting for >12 months were included in this prospective, nonrandomized controlled study. Twenty-four hours before performing kyphoplasty, the patients self-determined their inclusion into the kyphoplasty or control group so that 40 patients were treated with kyphoplasty, whereas 20 served as controls. This study assessed changes in radiomorphology, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, daily activities (European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study [EVOS] score), number of new vertebral fractures, and health care use. Outcomes were assessed before treatment and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. All patients received standard medical treatment (1g calcium, 1000 IE vitamin D(3), standard dose of oral aminobisphosphonate, pain medication, physical therapy).
Results: 
Kyphoplasty increased midline vertebral height of the treated vertebral bodies by 12.1%, whereas in the control group, vertebral height decreased by 8.2% (p = 0.001). Augmentation and internal stabilization by kyphoplasty resulted in a reduction of back pain. VAS pain scores improved in the kyphoplasty group from 26.2 +/- 2 to 44.2 +/- 3.3 (SD; p = 0.007) and in the control group from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 35.6 +/- 4.1 (not significant), whereas the EVOS score increased in the kyphoplasty group from 43.8 +/- 2.4 to 54.5 +/- 2.7 (p = 0.031) and in the control group from 39.8 +/- 4.5 to 43.8 +/- 4.6 (not significant). The number of back pain-related doctor visits within the 6-month follow-up period decreased significantly after kyphoplasty compared with controls: mean of 3.3 visits/patient in the kyphoplasty group and a mean of 8.6 visits/patient in the control group (p = 0.0147).
Conclusions: 
The results of this study show significantly increased vertebral height, reduced pain, and improved mobility in patients after kyphoplasty. Kyphoplasty performed in appropriately selected osteoporotic patients with painful vertebral fractures is a promising addition to current medical treatment.},

  abstract={Study design: 
The authors examined a case series of patients younger than 16 years who had sustained a traumatic spine injury.
Objectives: 
To evaluate clinical and radiologic findings and the effectiveness of conservative versus surgical treatment at long-term follow-up.
Summary of background data: 
Although injuries to children have received increasing coverage in the literature over the last several years, few reports have focused on the long-term results of conservative versus surgical treatment.
Methods: 
Forty-four patients who had sustained a traumatic spine injury at the average age of 14 years (range 3-16 years) were clinically and radiographically reviewed. The fractures were separated into three groups: stable (n = 20) and unstable (n = 13) injuries without cord lesion and fractures with spinal cord lesion (n = 11). Mean follow-up was 18 years (range 9-23 years).
Results: 
Conservative treatment was successful in all stable fractures, whereas it failed in the unstable injuries. The surgical treatment stabilized without significant deformity in five of the seven unstable fractures. Of 11 with spinal cord injuries, the 4 children conservatively treated developed a severely progressive, paralytic scoliosis. Only three of the seven surgically treated patients were stabilized without any deformity at follow-up.
Conclusion: 
In children and adolescents, conservative treatment is an available option for stable fractures without neurologic lesion. Early surgical treatment (instrumentation and fusion) is mandatory for unstable fractures and injuries associated with spinal cord lesion. In children, a traumatic spinal cord lesion may develop a deformity that is mainly scoliotic, kyphotic, or lordotic in >90% of the cases.},

  abstract={Surgical methods for type II odontoid fracture can be classified into 2 main groups: anterior or posterior approach. A more effective way to achieve bone fusion with the lowest possible surgical risk is needed. Therefore, the aim of our study was to describe and evaluate a novel technique, cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation for the treatment of type II odontoid fracture.This was a retrospective study enrolled 34 patients underwent posterior cable-dragged reduction/cantilever-beam internal fixation surgery. Medical records, rates of reduction, the location of the instrumentation and fracture healing during follow-up were analyzed. Once fracture healing was obtained, instrumentation was removed. Neck pain (scored using a visual analog scale [VAS]), neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and neck disability index (NDI) were recorded before and after removing the instrumentation during follow-up.The mean duration of follow up was 22.8 ± 5.3 months. There was no iatrogenic damage to nerves or blood vessels. Radiographic evaluation showed complete reduction in the 20 patients with fracture displacement and satisfactory fracture healing in all 34 cases. Titanium cable breakage was observed in 4 patients after fracture healing. After removal of instrumentation, significant improvements were seen in neck-pain VAS score, neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and NDI (all P < .01).Posterior cable-dragged reduction/cantilever-beam internal fixation was an optimal salvage maneuver to conventional surgical methods such as anterior screw fixation and C1-C2 screw-rod system. The operative difficulty and incidence of nerve and vascular injury were reduced. Its major disadvantage is the exposure and screw-setting at C3, which is left intact in traditional surgery, and it is suitable only for patients with intact C1 posterior arches.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
Vertebroplasty and more recently kyphoplasty are recognized as techniques in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and in case of pathological fracture like in secondary tumors. The recent introduction of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) that offers, at least theoretically, an osteointegrative capacity, absent in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), has generated interest for its use in the treatment of traumatic fractures (type A) even in young patients.
Methods: 
In this study, type A fractures without neurological signs were treated. A total of six male patients, of age between 21 and 55 years (mean age 38 years), were included. Fracture treatment was performed with kyphoplasty with balloon (Kyphon) and injection of calcium phosphate cement for a total of seven procedures.
Results: 
The results were evaluated according to the regional kyphosis angle and the local kyphosis angle. The postoperative X-ray control showed an average improvement of the regional kyphosis angle of 7.4°; however, this value was reduced by an average of 6.6° after 45 days with regard to the postoperative control. The local kyphosis angle showed an average improvement of 9° at the postoperative control with an average worsening of 9.2° in the control after 45 days.
Conclusions: 
While kyphoplasty with the use of CPC in the treatment of type A traumatic fractures was effective in the treatment of pain, it has not been so far effective concerning the maintenance of the reduction obtained intra-operatively and its osteointegrative effect.},

  abstract={This study aimed to evaluate the results and complications of image-guided percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using computed tomography (CT) and C-arm fluoroscopy, with finger-touch guidance to determine the needle entry point. Of the 86 patients (106 PKP) examined, 56 were treated for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and 30 for vertebral tumors. All patients underwent image-guided treatment using CT and conventional fluoroscopy, with finger-touch identification of a puncture point within a small incision (1.5 to 2 cm). Partial or complete pain relief was achieved in 98% of patients within 24 h of treatment. Moreover, a significant improvement in functional mobility and reduction in analgesic use was observed. CT allowed the detection of cement leakage in 20.7% of the interventions. No bone cement leakages with neurologic symptoms were noted. All work channels were made only once, and bone cement was distributed near the center of the vertebral body. Our study confirms the efficacy of PKP treatment in osteoporotic and oncological patients. The combination of CT and C-arm fluoroscopy with finger-touch guidance reduces the risk of complications compared with conventional fluoroscopy alone, facilitates the detection of minor cement leakage, improves the operative procedure, and results in a favorable bone cement distribution.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2005-2011.
Objective: 
To identify trends in procedural volume and rates in the time period surrounding publication of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the utility of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are frequently performed for vertebral compression fractures. Several RCTs have been published with conflicting outcomes regarding pain and quality of life compared with nonsurgical management and sham procedures. Four RCTs with discordant results were published in 2009.
Materials and methods: 
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample provided longitudinal, retrospective data on United States' inpatients between 2005 and 2011. Inclusion was determined by a principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code of 81.65 (percutaneous vertebroplasty) or 81.66 (percutaneous vertebral augmentation; "kyphoplasty"). No diagnoses were excluded. Years were stratified as "pre" (2005-2008) and "post" (2010-2011) in relation to the 4 RCTs published in 2009. Patient, hospital, and admission characteristics were compared using Pearson χ test.
Results: 
The estimated annual inpatient procedures performed decreased from 54,833 to 39,832 in the pre and post periods, respectively. The procedural rate for fractures decreased from 20.1% to 14.7% (P<0.0001). Patient and hospital demographics did not change considerably between the time periods. In the post period, weekend admissions increased (34.2% vs. 12.4%, P<0.0001), elective admissions decreased (21.4% vs. 40.0%, P<0.0001), routine discharge decreased (33.0% vs. 52.1%, P<0.0001), and encounters with ≥3 Elixhauser comorbidities increased (54.5% vs. 39.1%, P<0.0001).
Conclusions: 
The absolute rate of inpatient vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures for fractures decreased 5% in the period (2010-2011) following the publication of 4 RCTs in 2009. The proportion of elective admissions and routine discharges decreased, possibly indicating a population with greater disease severity. Although our analysis cannot demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship, the decreased inpatient volume and procedural rates surrounding the publication of sentinel negative RCTs is clearly observed.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare the surgical results of two kinds of posterior approach for osteoporotic thoracolumbar Kvmmell's disease.
Methods: 
Clinical and radiographic results of 1-segmental pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty (Group A, n equal to 12) or posterior shortening osteotomy (Group B, n equal to 16) for osteoporotic thoracolumbar Kvmmell's disease were analyzed retrospectively. Japanese orthopedic association (JOA) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were used for clinical evaluation. Neurological status was judged by Frankel grades. X-ray was used to evaluate the radiographic results. Complications related to operation and devices were also considered.
Results: 
The follow-up period was 12-54 months (average 29 months). Pre-and post-operative VAS were 9.3 and 3.2 in Group A, 8.9 and 2.5 in Group B, respectively. The mean JOA score at the final follow-up was significantly higher than that of pre-operation (t equal to 5.306, P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between Groups A and B (t equal to 0.618, P larger than 0.05). The kyphosis were corrected from preoperative 33.9 degree A)/37.3 degree B) to postoperative 10.3 degree A)/6.5 degree B), and 15.3 degree (A)/13.7 degree B) at the final follow-up. There was a significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. Frankel grade was improved from grade C preoperatively to postoperatively grade D or E in 7 cases of Group A and 5 cases of Group B, from grade D to E in 5 cases of Group A and 11 cases of Group B. The mean improvement was 1.6 and 1.7 grades for Groups A and B, respectively. There were no serious complications related to internal fixation.
Conclusions: 
The similar clinical results can be obtained by the two kinds of posterior surgical methods for osteoporotic Kvmmell's disease. Posterior spinal shortening is a better choice for patients with serious kyphosis combined with neurological deficit than the other.},

To compare the curative effects of two unilateral puncturation percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for the pain caused by multiple-level osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures (OVCF) in senile patients.
Patients and methods: 
From June 2008 to November 2014, eighty-nine cases suffering from fresh multiple-level OVCF were randomly divided into experimental group (n=51) and control group (n=38). Patients underwent PVP guided by C-arm fluoroscopy in the prone position. We monitored and recorded the visual analgesic scale (VAS) at pre-operation and 2 days post-operation, operation time, exposure duration, bone cement injection amount and extraosseous cement leakages.
Results: 
PVP procedures were successful in both groups without serious complications. The VAS scores in both two groups at 2 days post-operation were significantly lower than VAS scores at pre-operation (p<0.05). The operation time and exposure duration in the observational group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.05). However, bone cement injection amount and extraosseous cement leakages in the observing group were similar to those in control (p>0.05).
Conclusions: 
The curative effects of two unilateral puncturation PVPs were satisfactory. However, puncturation method had lower operation time and lower X-ray exposure dose. We concluded that puncturation method was a suitable method to be considered for clinical application.},

  abstract={We previously reported the results of a randomized controlled trial that found no benefit of vertebroplasty over a sham procedure for acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures up to 6 months. We report here the 12-month and 24-month clinical outcomes of this trial. Eligible participants (n = 78) were randomly assigned to receive either vertebroplasty (n = 38) or a sham procedure (n = 40). Randomization was stratified by treatment center, sex, and symptom duration (<6 weeks or ≥6 weeks). Participants, investigators (except the treating radiologists), and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. Enrolment occurred between April 2004 and October 2008 with follow-up completed October 2010. The primary outcome was overall pain measured on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal imaginable pain). Secondary outcomes included pain at rest and at night, disability, quality of life, perceived recovery, and adverse events, including incident clinically apparent vertebral fractures. At 12 and 24 months, complete data were available for 67 (86%) and 57 (73%) participants, respectively. At 12 months participants in the active group improved by 2.4 ± 2.7 (mean ± SD) units in overall pain compared with 1.9 ± 2.8 units in the sham group, adjusted between-group mean difference (MD) 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], –0.9 to 1.5), whereas at 24 months participants in the active group had improved by 3.0 ± 3.1 units compared with 1.9 ± 3.0 units in the sham group, MD 1.1 (95% CI, –0.3 to 2.4). No significant between-group differences were observed for any of the secondary efficacy outcomes at 12 or 24 months. There were no between-group differences in incident clinical vertebral fractures up to 24 months (active: n = 14, sham: n = 13), although the study had inadequate power for this outcome. These results provide further evidence that the use of this treatment in routine care is unsupported.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture (AOVF). However, the matter of which surgical approach should be selected remains controversial. This research aims to compare the clinical results of unilateral and bilateral PVP for AOVF.
Methods: 
From January 2008 to December 2011, 68 patients with AOVF were randomly assigned to the unilateral puncture group (n=36) or the bilateral group (n=32). These patients underwent percutaneous injection of polymethyl methacrylate into posterior pedicle by the unilateral or bilateral puncture approach. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) were recorded on presentation, at 1 week, 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The cement leakage was measured by x-ray and computed tomography scan.
Results: 
Follow-up data showed there were no significant differences in VAS and QUALEFFO between 2 groups at 1 week after PVP and only significant difference was observed between 2 groups at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The cement leakage was 52.7% in the unilateral puncture group and 28.1% in the bilateral group.
Conclusions: 
Compared with unilateral puncture, use of bilateral approach during PVP may result in more superior long-term outcomes and less cement leakage for patients with AOVF.},

  abstract={Purpose: 
The aim of this study was to improve the accuracy of puncture to the median vertebral body using the unilateral transpedicular approach on percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). We have developed and evaluated a simple puncture simulation method based on the puncture angle determined by preoperative computed tomography (CT).
Material and methods: 
Two groups were evaluated. The first (group A) comprised 23 patients (34 vertebral bodies) who had undergone PVP without preoperative puncture simulation before May 2004, and the second group (group B) comprised 24 patients (39 vertebral bodies) who had undergone preoperative puncture simulation and PVP after May 2004. CT in the prone position was performed, and the puncture angle on CT (PAC) via the vertebral arch pedicle targeting the anterior one-third median site of the vertebral body was determined. Puncture was performed by targeting the isocenter established on a fluoroscopic monitor based on the PAC. Determinations were made of the success rate (SR) of the median puncture of the vertebral body, the effect of treatment using the visual analogue score, and the overall procedural time between groups A and B.
Results: 
The SR was 56% (19/34 vertebral bodies) in group A, and 97% (37/38 vertebral bodies), including only one vertebral body in which it was difficult to perform the unilateral approach on CT images, in group B, with the difference being significant by Student's t-test (P < 0.001). Among patients with available follow-up data, the unipedicular and bipedicular approaches achieved adequate pain relief with mean decreases in pain severity of 5.1 +/- 2.6 and 5.9 +/- 2.8, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment effect between the two groups was observed (P = 0.811). The overall procedure time per puncture was shorten for the simulation group (36.0 min) than for group A (73.1 min), as shown by regression analysis.
Conclusion: 
The preoperative PAC determination for PVP under fluoroscopy increased the completion rate of PVP by the unilateral transpedicular approach. This method should be accepted from the viewpoint of burden reduction on patients and surgeons.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To comparatively study the efficacy and safety of unilateral and bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of painful multi-vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures.
Methods: 
From May 2002 to June 2007, 41 consecutive patients with painful multi-vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures underwent unilateral or bilateral kyphoplasty. The unilateral group included 3 male and 14 female with an average age of 70.4 (range 52 to 91 years old). The bilateral group included 4 men and 20 women with an average age of 72.4 (range 61 to 87 years old). Each procedure included insertion of inflatable balloon, fracture reduction and cement filling under "C"-arm monitoring. Preoperative and postoperative pain level, SF-36 score, radiographs and complications were recorded and analyzed.
Results: 
All 41 patients tolerated the operation well. The mean operation time were (86 +/- 32) min and (120 +/- 26) min for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively; the mean volume of cement injected into one level were (3.9 +/- 1.6) ml and (5.4 +/- 2.1) ml for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively. The mean follow-up were (32.5 +/- 17.2) months and (30.7 +/- 14.3) months for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively. The mean VAS pain score of unilateral group decreased significantly from 7.4 +/- 2.1 preoperatively to 2.7 +/- 1.9 postoperatively (t = 2.50, P < 0.05) and 3.1 +/- 2.2 at final follow-up, the mean VAS pain score of bilateral group decreased significantly from 7.9 +/- 2.1 preoperatively to 2.3 +/- 2.5 postoperatively (t = 2.41, P < 0.05) and 2.7 +/- 2.2 at final follow-up, no significant difference was found between two groups. Significant increase of the mean height of anterior and medial vertebral body were recorded after the operation and maintained at final follow-up. The mean correction of local kyphosis was 7.2 degrees +/- 4.9 degrees for unilateral group and 7.3 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees for bilateral group, no significant difference was found between two groups. Postoperatively, 6 of 8 subscales measured by SF-36 were significantly improved for both groups. Complications were found in 7 patients including 6 cases of cement leakage and 1 case of pulmonary embolization.
Conclusion: 
As a minimally invasive procedure, unilateral or bilateral kyphoplasty is effective and relatively safe for multi-vertebral osteoporotic compression fracture.},

The goal of this study was to compare the clinical effects and safety of unilateral vs bilateral balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Randomized controlled trials involving a total of 876 patients and comparing the efficacy of unilateral vs bilateral balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were identified.

  abstract={Object: 
External supports serve as a traditional treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs). However, the role of external supports in the treatment of OVF remains inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of a rigid external support in the healing of OVFs by prospectively evaluating union (fracture settling) rates and prognostic variables for patients suffering from an incident OVF.
Methods: 
Fifty-five patients with acute back pain were enrolled in this study after being diagnosed with an OVF based on MRI findings. Patients were treated using a plastic thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) and underwent follow-up at 2, 3, and 6 months. Vertebrae were referred to as "settled" when there was no dynamic mobility on sitting lateral and supine lateral radiographs. At the time of the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, the patients were divided into 2 groups, the "settled group" and the "unsettled group." Patients in these groups were compared with regard to clinical and radiographic features.
Results: 
Of the 55 patients enrolled, 53 patients were followed up for 6 months. There were 14 men and 39 women with an average age of 75.3 years. Fracture settling of the affected vertebra was defined in 54.7% of the patients at 2 months, in 79.2% at 3 months, and in 88.7% at 6 months. All 5 components of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire improved significantly both at 3 months and 6 months. Patients in the unsettled group exhibited a statistically greater likelihood of having fractures at the thoracolumbar junction, Type A3 fractures, and fractures with a diffuse low-intensity area on T2-weighted MRI studies at 3 months. In contrast, at 6 months, the only statistically significant difference between the groups was patient age.
Conclusions: 
The biomechanical disadvantages of OVFs (location, type, and size) adversely influencing the fracture healing were overcome by the treatment using a TLSO within 6 months. The authors' findings show that a TLSO plays a biomechanical role in the healing of OVFs.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
Injuries to the upper cervical spine in children are rare and account for 0.6 to 9.5% of all cervical spine injuries. We present a detailed analysis of the children and adolescents with unstable upper cervical spine injuries treated at our spinal centre.
Material: 
During 16 years of follow-up, unstable injury to the upper cervical spine was recorded in 23 children and adolescents. Two patients (8.7%) were treated conservatively and 21 (91.3%) underwent surgery. The patients were allocated by age to three groups: 0-9 year, 10-14 year and 15-18 year categories. Twenty patients were seen at the final clinical and radiographic follow-up. One patient died at 62 months after surgery and two patients unfit for transport were evaluated on the basis of mailed interviews. The interval between injury and final evaluation ranged from 6 to 137 months, with an average of 53.4 months.
Methods: 
The patients treated conservatively first wore a Philadelphia collar, then a custom-made brace, and eventually a soft Schanze cervical collar to finish the healing process. Application of a halo vest was considered a surgical procedure and was used only in very small children. In unstable odontoid fractures, direct osteosynthesis with two cannulated titanium screws was performed from the anterior approach in older children while, in small children, transoral or submandibular retropharyngeal decompression to treat spinal stenosis caused by bone fragments was carried out and a halo vest was applied. Hangman's fractures were treated by anterior cervical discectomy, fusion with bone graft and anterior plate fixation. The other types of unstable fractures were managed from the posterior approach by occipitocervical fixation, atlantoaxial fixation or instrumented fusion extended caudally. The patients characteristics included gender, age, mechanism of injury, type of injury, neurological findings, type of therapy or surgery, complications and treatment outcome. Neurological status was evaluated using the Frankel classification.
Results: 
The patient group comprised 14 boys (60.9%) and nine girls (39.1%), which gave a gender ratio of 3 : 2. The age of patients at injury ranged from 2 to 18 years, with an average of 11 years and 6 months. The most frequent injuries included rotational or vertical atlantoaxial dislocation in eight (34.8%) and odontoid fractures in seven (30.4%) patients; atlas fracture was recorded in three (13.0%) and hangman's fracture also in three (13.0%) patients; occipitocervical displacement was found in one (4.3%) and complex atlantoaxial fracture also in one patient (4.3%). At the time of injury, 17 patients (73.9%) had no neurological deficit (Frankel grade E), three had Frankel grade A (one paraplegic with a concomitant T5 spinal cord injury) and three had Frankel grade D neurological deficits. Of the six patients with neurological deficit, two showed improvement by one or two Frankel grades. The method of dorsal atlantoaxial fixation was used in eight patients (Magerl fixation in 2 and Harms method in 6). Direct osteosynthesis of an odontoid fracture was performed in four patients, halo fixation was applied in four, C2-C3 discectomy with tricortical bone grafting and plating was carried out in three, occipitocervical fixation was used in three patients, and direct atlas osteosynthesis, simple decompression and simple non-instrumented dorsal spondylodesis each was performed in one patient. Neither intra-operative complications nor post-operative complications related to the surgical technique were recorded. Osteoarthritis or bone non-union, as late post-operative complications, were found in two patients. All other patients showed bone healing by first intention in the desired extent. Superficial or deep wound infections were not recorded.
Discussion: 
In the first age category, the number of boys and girls with injuries to the upper cervical spine was equal while, in the third one, the boys outnumbered the girls more than twice. Of the 23 patients, 91.3% were surgically treated; the anterior approach was used in approximately one third of the patients and the posterior approach in the rest of them. The high number of surgical interventions is due to the fact that the most serious paediatric spinal injuries are referred to our centre.
Conclusions: 
1. Injuries to the upper cervical spine are most frequently found in the youngest children and in adolescents who, however, frequently have injury also to the lower cervical spine. 2. Neurological deficit is relatively frequent but has a better prognosis than in adults. The youngest children with mild deficits have the best prognosis. 3. The mortality rate in young children with upper cervical spine injuries is evidently high, mostly due to associated head, chest and abdomen trauma 4. Therapy, particularly in small children, is strictly individual.},

The devastation and cost of missing even one unstable cervical spine fracture is tremendous. The existence of patients with an unsuspected cervical spine fracture who have few, if any, symptoms and/or signs of an injury to the cervical spine is a valid concern and a dilemma for the practicing physician. Thus the principle of the occult unstable cervical spine fracture, which has been established as the standard of care, has major significance and implications.

  abstract={Objective: 
This study mainly aimed to evaluate complications of cement leakage for osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures by PVP using HVC, and access the clinical efficacy.
Methods: 
Between May 2013 and June 2015, 66 patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures, who underwent PVP (36 HVC and 30 LVC) in our hospital, were enrolled. Cement leakage, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), refracture of the cemented vertebrae, and adjacent vertebral fractures were evaluated. The follow-up time was 1 year.
Results: 
The overall cement leakage rate was 30.55% in the HVC group, lower than 77.77% obtained in the LVC group (P = 0.00). The incidence rates of cement leakage into paravertebral area (P = 0.02) and vein (P = 0.04) in the HVC group were significantly lower than those of the LVC group; however, no differences were found for disc space (P = 0.72) and intraspinal space (P = 0.58). There were no differences in VAS, ODI, refracture of cemented vertebrae, and adjacent vertebral fracture between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: 
PVP using HVC not only can reduce cement leakage, especially in the paravertebral area and peripheral vein, but also has satisfactory clinical effect.},

  abstract={Context: 
The complex anatomy and the importance of ligaments in providing stability at the upper cervical spine region (O-C1-C2) require the use of many imaging modalities to evaluate upper cervical injuries (UCI). While separate classifications have been developed for distinct injuries, a more practical treatment algorithm can be derived from the injury pattern in UCI.
Objective: 
To propose a practical treatment algorithm to guide treatment based on injuries characteristic of UCI.
Methods: 
A literature review was performed on the Pubmed database using the following keywords: (1) "occipital condyle injury"; (2) "craniocervical dislocation or atlanto-occipital dislocation or craniocervical dislocation"; (3) "atlas fractures"; and (4) "axis fractures". Just articles containing the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of specific UCI were included. The data obtained were analyzed by the authors, dividing the UCI into two groups: Group 1 - patients with clear ligamentous injury and Group 2 - patients with fractures without ligament disruption.
Results: 
Injuries with ligamentous disruption, suggesting surgical treatment, include: atlanto-occipital dislocation, mid-substance transverse ligament injury, and C1-2 and C2-3 ligamentous injuries. In contrast, condyle, atlas, and axis fractures without significant displacement/misalignment can be initially treated using external orthoses. Odontoid fractures with risk factors for non-union are an exception in Group 2 once they are better treated surgically. Patients with neurological deficits may have more unstable injuries.
Conclusions: 
Ascertaining the status of relevant ligamentous structures, fracture patterns and alignment are important in determining surgical compared with non-surgical treatment for patients with UCI.},

  abstract={Study design: 
A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To investigate the risk factors associated with upper instrumented vertebral (UIV) fractures in adult lumbar deformity.
Summary of background data: 
Long segment lumbar fusions may lead to junctional failures. The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with junctional failures.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven consecutive patients from 2001 to 2008 with minimum 4 levels fused, lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) of L5 or S1, upper instrumented vertebra of T10 or distal, and no previous surgery proximal to the instrumentation were retrospectively reviewed. We describe the UIV angle, the sagittal angle of the upper instrumented vertebra with the horizontal. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, 7 patients with UIV fractures; group 2, 6 patients with other proximal failures; and group 3, 14 patients with no proximal complications.
Results: 
The mean number of levels fused was 5.7 (4-7), 5.2 (4-8), and 6.2 (4-8); mean age was 64.1, 61.8, and 64.1, and mean body mass index was 33.5, 30.0, and 31.6 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P > 0.05). Osteotomies were performed in 5 of 7 in group 1, 1 of 6 in group 2, and 5 of 14 in group 3. Mean follow-up was 26.3 months. The average intraoperative UIV angle (UIV0) and immediate postoperative UIV angle (UIV1) were 18.6°/15.4° for group 1, 5.7°/5.3° for group 2, and 10.3°/7.1° for group 3 (P < 0.05). Surgical revision rates were higher in group 1 (71%) compared with groups 2 (50%) and 3 (43%). Eight of 11 (73%) patients with upper instrumented vertebra of L1 or L2 had either UIV fracture or other proximal failure compared with 5 of 16 (31%) in patients with upper instrumented vertebra of T10, T11, or T12.
Conclusion: 
Our series of long lumbar fusions had a high long-term complication and revision rate. A high UIV angle on intraoperative lateral radiograph was strongly associated with UIV fractures. UIVs of L1 or L2 had a higher rate of adjacent segment or UIV failure.},

The largest received urine volume in each patient at one intermittent catheterization did not differ significantly between the groups. However, in three patients in the NC group the volumes exceeded 1000 ml. Thus, irrespective of treatment dip slides showed bacteriuria in 84% of the patients. Perioperative indwelling catheters do not seem to cause many more infection complications than no bladder drainage during surgery, and the advantages of reduced risk of bladder distension injury and more accurate monitoring of fluid balance suggest their use.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral augmentation (VA) techniques have changed the paradigm of treatment during the past decade and involve injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement directly into a compressed vertebral body. During the summer of 2009, the INVEST trial was one of 2 randomized controlled studies that reported equivalence between vertebroplasty and a control procedure. 
Objective: 
In this analysis, we sought to compare the subset of patients studied in the INVEST trial to a tertiary academic institution with respect to 2 variables: Workers compensation status and presence of advanced imaging prior to the procedure.
Study design: 
Retrospective review of 634 procedures.
Methods: 
We performed a retrospective review of 634 vertebral augmentation procedures at our institution between June 2004 and August 2008, overlapping with the dataset of the INVEST trial. The primary comparison was whether patients received Workers compensation and/or advanced imaging prior to the procedure. The study was IRB approved, and in accordance with HIPAA guidelines.
Results: 
There were 409 patients who underwent 634 procedures between June 2004 and August 2008. Among 634 procedures, only 3 included Workers compensation. Therefore, the majority of patients (> 99%) did not receive Workers compensation compared to the INVEST trial (11 - 13%). Similarly, in 629 out of 634 procedures (99.2%), patients underwent advanced imaging comprised of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or bone scan.
Limitations: 
We simply looked at 2 elements of the patient demographic in a time-matched fashion and compared it to the U.S. based INVEST trial. It is possible that despite our diligent efforts to review the data set, we have inadvertently excluded some patients, the incorporation of whom might have changed the statistics.
Conclusion: 
We reviewed our time-matched database in terms of 2 variables we thought curious in the INVEST trial.  In comparison to our practice, where advanced imaging is essentially required and Workers compensation largely not seen, these aspects of the INVEST trial's population stood out.},

The intraoperative failure of the anterior vertebral cortex from osteopenic bone and failure to achieve complete contact between the dens and axis were encountered. The defects were supplemented by using the osteoconductive agent Norian. Outcome was evaluated to determine the utility of this method.

  abstract={Study design: 
This is a prospective study on consecutive patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Objectives: 
To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing appropriate acute lesions before a percutaneous cement augmentation technique.
Background: 
Vertebral compression fractures related to osteoporosis are very common in the elderly. Acute OVCFs are usually treated conservatively. In recent years, minimally invasive percutaneous cement augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been introduced as alternative treatment options. However, the localization of acute fractures of the spine can be difficult, yet is critical in implementing these treatments.
Methods: 
A total of 168 patients were enrolled in this study. All participants were 50 years of age or older and were admitted via the emergency room because of acute severe back pain with suspected OVCFs with or without a history of trauma. Standard plain radiographs and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the spine were initially obtained in the emergency room. An MRI scan with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequencing of the spine was performed within 3 days of hospitalization. Patients were divided into 2 groups: single group and multiple group. The single group consisted of those with a single fracture, and the multiple group consisted of those with multiple fractures of the vertebral body, as diagnosed using only standard radiographs and CT scans. We compared the level and number of fractures from the initial findings of the standard radiographs and CT scans with the MRI scan results within each group.
Results: 
The mean age of the study participants was 68.9 years. Forty-nine patients were male and 119 were female. In the single group, the concordance rate of diagnosis was 77% (97/125) and the discordance rate was 23% (28/125). In the multiple group, the discordance rate was 65% (28/43). There was a significantly higher rate of misdiagnosis in the multiple group compared with the single group (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
MRI with STIR sequencing exhibited a multitude of benefits in the exact identification of acute lesions and hidden lesions. Because of the high rate of misdiagnosis using standard plain radiographs and CT scans of the spine for OVCFs, MRI with STIR sequencing should be considered before cement augmentation procedures. Moreover, in cases with multiple lesions or severe osteoporosis, the importance of MRI should be further emphasized.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been widely applied in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures over the past two decades. However as one of the major complications, the rate of cement leakage seems not to be decreased significantly. In this study, the rate of cement leakage was compared between two groups using two different cement injection cannulas. The purpose was to determine the efficacy of side-opening cannula on preventing cement leakage in vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
A retrospective study was conducted from January 2013 to December 2015. Totally 225 patients who received bilateral vertebroplasty due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were included in the study. The patients were divided into test group who received vertebroplasty with side-opening cannulas and control group who received vertebroplasty with front-opening cannulas. The patients' medical records were reviewed to determine the bone marrow density, preoperative vertebral compression ratio, preoperative and postoperative VAS, operation time, volume of injected bone cement, rate of cement leakage. Post-operative X-rays and CT scans were utilized to assess the degree of Cement leakage. Comparisons between groups and clinical results on VAS in each group were analyzed with appropriate test.
Results: 
All the patients were performed successfully without symptomatic complications. The back pain was significantly relieved after operation in both groups (P < 0.05). At 6 days and 6 months follow-up, there was no significant difference in the mean VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The rate of cement leakage in the test group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is a safe and effective minimally invasive method in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, the rate of cement leakage can be significantly reduced by redirecting the cement flow.},

The authors assess the utility of routine biopsy at vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fracture (VCF) as a tool in the early detection of malignancy in presumed benign VCF.
Methods: 
A prospective observational study was conducted on a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing vertebroplasty over a 5-year period between April 2006 and March 2011 at the Royal London Hospital. Polymethylmethacrylate cement injection was used in every procedure. Intraoperative vertebral body biopsy was performed routinely at every level of VCF. Pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, analgesic usage, and complications were recorded preoperatively and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.
Results: 
A total of 202 levels were augmented in 147 patients. The most common levels augmented were T-12 (17%), L-1 (18%), and L-4 (10%). Analysis of 184 routine vertebral biopsies in 135 patients revealed that in 86 patients with presumed osteoporosis and no prior cancer diagnosis, 4 (4.7%) had a malignant VCF. In 20 known cancer patients presumed to be in remission, 2 (10%) had a malignant VCF. Routine vertebral biopsy returned an overall cancer diagnosis rate of 5.5% (6 of 109) when combining the 2 groups (patients with no prior history of cancer or cancer thought to be in remission). In these 6 patients, history, examination, laboratory tests, and preprocedure imaging all failed to suggest malignancy diagnosed at routine biopsy. Significant reductions in pain VAS and ODI scores were evident at Day 1 and were sustained at up to 1 year postoperatively (p < 0.001). They were not dependent on the level of fracture (T3-10, T11-L2, or L3-S1) (p > 0.05), number of levels treated (single level, 2 levels, or > 2 levels) (p > 0.05), or etiology of VCF (p > 0.05). The complication rate was 6% (9 of 147). There were 5 deaths, none of which were directly related to surgery.
Conclusions: 
Routine vertebral biopsy performed at vertebroplasty may demonstrate cancer-related VCFs in unsuspected patients with no previous cancer diagnosis or active malignancy in patients previously thought to be in remission. This early diagnosis of cancer or relapsed disease will play an important role in expediting patients' subsequent cancer management. In cases of multiple-level VCF, the authors advocate biopsy at each level to maximize the diagnostic yield from the specimens and to avoid missing a malignancy at a single level.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is now widely performed to treat VCF, which is usually caused by osteoporosis. Previous researches have reported unsuspected malignancies found by biopsy. However, the safety and cost-effective profiles of routine biopsy during PKP are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of routine biopsy during PKP in treatment of VCF.
Methods: 
Ninety-three patients (September 2007-November 2010) undergoing PKP without biopsy were reviewed as the control group. One hundred and three consecutive patients (November 2010-September 2013) undergoing PKP with biopsy of every operated vertebral level were prospectively enrolled as the biopsy group. The rate of unsuspected lesions was reported, and the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control were compared between the two groups.
Results: 
No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups, regarding the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control. Four unsuspected lesions were found in the biopsy group, three of which were malignancies with a 2.9% (3/103) unsuspected malignancy rate. The economic analysis showed that routine biopsy was cost-effective in finding new malignancies comparing with a routine cancer screening campaign.
Conclusions: 
Routine biopsy during PKP was safe and cost-effective in finding unsuspected malignancies. We advocate routine biopsy in every operated vertebral level during PKP for VCF patients.},

  abstract={Background: 
The optimal form of treatment for C2 spine fractures is controversial. This investigation analyzed the variations in treatment of C2 fractures over time, by age group, and by geographic location.
Methods: 
The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample database was queried to identify patients 18 years and older who sustained C2 fracture without neurologic injury from 2006 to 2012. Subsequently, patients were further filtered based on the intervention they received: collar, halo, and surgery. Regions of hospital used in analysis were defined as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Linear regression models were used to analyze trends for C2 incidence rates and treatment type. Analysis of variance tests were used to determine differences among procedure groups when stratified by regions and age groups.
Results: 
Surgical intervention for C2 fracture increased from 36.5% in 2006 to 55.7% in 2012 (r = 0.116, P < 0.001). In contrast, the rate of halo use decreased from 57.8% in 2006 to 37.1% in 2012 (r = -0.139, P < 0.001). Surgery displayed increasing trend across all age groups. A greater proportion of patients in the Northeast were treated by collar compared with all other regions (P < 0.001). In contrast, halo use was significantly lower in the Northeast than the other 3 regions (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
This investigation demonstrated that surgical management of C2 fractures is increasing in frequency over time and at all age groups. Furthermore, the treatment of these fractures varies by region-the Northeast had the highest incidence of collar use and lowest rate of halo use.},

  abstract={Background: 
Cancers that metastasize to the spine and primary cancers such as multiple myeloma can result in vertebral compression fractures or instability. Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures.
Methods: 
We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral augmentation interventions.
Results: 
The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon.
Conclusions: 
Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be treated by minimally invasive percutaneous vertebral augmentation with bone cement using vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty. Transcutaneous reduction and vertebral body stenting has been the most recent principle. In contrast to balloon placement in kyphoplasty, the stent remains in the vertebral body and supports both the vertebral body and cement filling. In this retrospective study we present the essential information on the method and our first results.
Material and methods: 
The method of vertebral body stent placement was used in 22 patients treated at 29 levels. Of these, 19 patients with 26 segments followed up for 3 months were evaluated. The group included 12 women and seven men with an average age of 68.3 years (12 to 83). The patients assessed their subjective complaints on the visual analogue scale (VAS) before surgery, and then at 1, 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively. The value of vertebral body reduction was obtained by measurement of anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body heights (AVBH, MVBH and PVBH, respectively) and a change in the vertebral body kyphotic angle (VBKA).
Results: 
Twenty-four vertebrae were treated for osteoporotic fracture and two as preventive stenting in metastatic breast cancer. In 24 fractures, the stents extended fully in 20 vertebrae, i.e., 40 stents. These fractures evidently were not older than 3 months. In four segments, a total of eight stents did not extend at all or did only slightly. The 20 stabilised vertebral bodies had an average AVBH value of 19.41 mm pre-operatively and that of 22.775 mm post-operatively, which is an average increase by 3.365 mm in absolute numbers and by 17.34 %. The average pre- and post-operative MVBH values were 16.625 mm and 23.065 mm, which was improvement by 6.41 mm or by 38.56 %. The average PVBH values pre- and post-operatively were 26.835 mm and 28.31 mm, which meant improvement by 1.475 mm or by 5.5 %. The average correction of the kyphotic angle was 4.58°, i.e., 35.2 %, from a VBKA of 11.71° pre-operatively to 7.13° post-operatively. There were five cases (22.7 %) of cement leakage, i.e., two of ventral leakage, one of lateral leakage, one of dorsal leakage through a canal left in the pedicle by cannula insertion, and a dorsal leakage in metastatic disease. No neurological findings were recorded. The average VAS scores were as follows: 81.4 before surgery, 30.6 at 1 week, 16.3 at 6 weeks and 15.4 at 12 weeks after surgery.
Discussion: 
Two experimental and one clinical study on vertebral body stenting only have been available in the recent relevant literature. In comparison with their results as well as with those of previous reports on vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, our results showed high quality fracture reduction in all vertebrae. The rapid decrease in pain intensity in our group is comparable with all available groups treated by any method of vertebral body augmentation by cement injection; and cement leakage was recorded in even fewer cases.
Conclusions: 
The novel method of vertebral body stenting with cement augmentation provides a rapid pain relief, gives stability to fracture reduction and has a low rate of cement leakage. However, care must be taken not to indicate cases with a damaged posterior corticalis of the vertebral body.},

  abstract={Object: 
We present a series of patients with acute thoraco-lumbar fractures in whom we performed balloon vertebroplasty (kyphoplasty), either alone (percutaneous) or combined to posterior transpedicular fusion (open kyphoplasty). We emphasize the possibility of extending the use of kyphoplasty to non-osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and combining this method with traditional posterior fusion procedures.
Methods: 
Between 2003 and 2005, 138 patients suffering from thoraco-lumbar acute fractures, were treated in our Department. 87 corresponded to one vertebral level fractures; 34 to two levels, and the remaining 17 patients had more than two vertebrae affected. 65 patients (47%) received conservative therapy (rest in bed, physiotherapy, and subsequent progressive mobilization with cast). The remaining ones (73 cases; 43%) were treated invasively, performing balloon vertebroplasty alone (n=25), or kyphoplasty associated to posterior fusion in 15 cases (11%). Different kinds of screw posterior fusions were performed in the remaining patients (n=33; 24%). The latter group was not included in the present study. In the conservatively treated group (CTG), seven patients (11%) had a bad outcome, showing a persistency of hyperintensity in MRI-T2 sequences of the vertebral body, suggesting local edema. Mean hospitalization rate was 29 days in CTG. None of the 40 patients treated with kyphoplasty alone or combined with fusion showed abnormalities in neurological examination. They were classified in two groups: "Group a": Kyphoplasty alone (n=25). Mean of sagittal index in this group was 11 degrees (range: 6 degrees -15 degrees). In 9 patients, vertebral body collapse exceeded 25%. Mean hospitalization rate was 14 days. "Group b": Kyphoplasty and posterior fusion techniques (n=15): Mean sagittal index was 23 degrees (range: 13 degrees - 40 degrees). All the patients presented with a vertebral body collapse superior to 25%. All of them had posterior body wall involvement. This group was treated by surgery (decompression and fusion) and open vertebral body kyphoplasty. Mean hospitalization rate was 35 days. Clinical results of these 40 patients were measured by means of work status, restriction of physical activities and analgesic drug intake. Except for four patients of "Group b", 36 returned to their work. In 11 cases a slight reduction of physical activity was registered. Average "Group a" follow-up was 47 months (range: 10-72 months). A mean kyphosis correction of 5,3 degrees (sagittal index) was reached in this group. Average "Group b" follow-up was 26 months (range: 9-54). Mean kyphosis correction was 10,3 degrees . As for complications, we registered three balloon disruptions and five leakages into the disc.
Conclusions: 
Kyphoplasty could constitute an alternative and/or complementary treatment of traditional spinal stabilization-fusion procedures in non osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Therefore, it should be offered, when indicated, as a substantial possible part of the treatment, to the patients suffering from vertebral fractures. Additional advantages of combining kyphoplasty and posterior fusion are the possibility of reducing the number of fused levels (shorter instrumentations), and to perform a 360 degree stabilization-remodeling through a single posterior approach.},

The procedure is used for neoplastic lesions, aggressive angioma, but also osteoporotic compression fractures.

However, to practice a vertebro-plasty for an osteoporotic compression fracture without any long term management of the osteoporotic disease is useless. Unfortunately, it still happens too often and it is essential that orthopedic surgeons, general practitioner, radiologist, rheumatologist, and any practitioners work together to guarantee the optimal management of our patients.},

  abstract={Percutaneous vertebral augmentation, with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) as its most widely used variant, is currently the only intervention for painful osteoporotic compression fractures. This procedure offers immediate and substantial pain relief in over 80% of treated patients with a low reported complication rate (< 1.6%). A large number of studies have shown promising results and the superiority of this treatment over conservative treatment has been established. Results of the first two, long-awaited, placebo-controlled trials were unexpected: improvement after PVP was similar to improvement after placebo treatment. Limitations in the design of both trials prevented widespread implementation of the results. We believe that PVP cannot be regarded as an obsolete treatment as long as patients are carefully selected. Patients with persistent (over 2 months) and painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures have been shown to benefit from vertebroplasty and are therefore suitable candidates for this procedure, which, in these cases, can prevent complications due to long-term disabling pain.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Systematic literature review.
Objective: 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using the data presented in published clinical studies, with respect to patient pain relief, restoration of mobility and vertebral body height, complication rate, and incidence of new adjacent vertebral fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been gaining popularity for treating vertebral fractures. Current reviews provide an overview of the procedures but are not comprehensive and tend to rely heavily on personal experience. This article aimed to compile all available data and evaluate the clinical outcome of the 2 procedures.
Methods: 
This is a systematic review of all the available data presented in peer-reviewed published clinical trials. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated, and data were collected targeting specific standard measurements. Where possible, a quantitative aggregation of the data was performed.
Results: 
A large proportion of subjects had some pain relief, including 87% with vertebroplasty and 92% with kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was possible using kyphoplasty (average 6.6 degrees ) and for a subset of patients using vertebroplasty (average 6.6 degrees ). Cement leaks occurred for 41% and 9% of treated vertebrae for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. New fractures of adjacent vertebrae occurred for both procedures at rates that are higher than the general osteoporotic population but approximately equivalent to the general osteoporotic population that had a previous vertebral fracture.
Conclusions: 
The problem with stating definitely that vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective procedures is the lack of comparative, blinded, randomized clinical trials. Standardized evaluative methods should be adopted.},

  abstract={After more than two decades the treatment effect of cement augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) has now been questioned by two blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials. Thus many practitioners are uncertain on the recommendation for cement augmentation techniques in elderly patients with osteoporotic VCF. This systematic review analyses randomised controlled trials on vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to provide an overview on the current evidence. From an electronic database research 8 studies could be identified meeting our inclusion criteria of osteoporotic VCF in elderly (age>60 years), treatment with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, controlled with placebo or standard medical therapy, quality of life, function, or pain as primary parameter, and randomisation. Only two studies were properly blinded using a sham-operation as control. The other studies were using a non-surgical treatment control group. Further possible bias may be caused by manufacturer involvement in financing of three published RCT. There is level Ib evidence that vertebroplasty is no better than placebo, which is conflicting with the available level IIb evidence that there is a positive short-term effect of cement augmentation compared to standard medical therapy with regard to QoL, function and pain. Kyphoplasty is not superior to vertebroplasty with regard to pain, but with regard to VCF reduction (evidence level IIb). Kyphoplasty is probably not cost-effective (evidence level IIb), and vertebroplasty has not more than short-term cost-effectiveness (evidence level IV). Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty cannot be recommended as standard treatment for osteoporotic VCF. Ongoing sham-controlled trials may provide further evidence in this regard.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are routinely used to treat vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs) resulting from osteoporosis or vertebral body tumors in order to provide rapid pain relief. However, it remains debated whether VP or KP results in superior outcomes versus medical management alone in patients experiencing VCFs.
Purpose: 
To determine the level of evidence supporting VP or KP for the treatment of VCFs.
Study design: 
Systematic review of the literature.
Patient sample: 
Patients with osteoporotic or tumor-associated VCFs.
Outcome measures: 
Self-reported and functional measures.
Methods: 
We reviewed all articles published between 1980 and 2008 reporting outcomes after VP or KP for osteoporotic or tumor-associated VCFs and rated the level of evidence and grades of recommendation (per North American Spine Society [NASS] guidelines) supporting the use of VP or KP for the treatment of VCFs.
Results: 
Seventy-four VP studies for osteoporotic VCF (1 level I, 3 level II, 70 level IV), 35 KP studies for osteoporotic VCF (2 level II, 33 level IV), and 18 VP/KP for tumor VCFs (all level IV) were reviewed. There is good evidence (level I) that VP results in superior pain control within the first 2 weeks of intervention compared with optimal medical management for osteoporotic VCFs. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that VP results in less analgesia use, less disability, and greater improvement in general health when compared with optimal medical management within the first 3 months after intervention. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that by 2 years after intervention, VP provides a similar degree of pain control and physical function as optimal medical management. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that KP results in greater improvement in daily activity, physical function, and pain relief when compared with optimal medical management for osteoporotic VCFs by 6 months after intervention. There is poor-quality evidence that VP or KP results in greater pain relief for tumor-associated VCFs.
Conclusions: 
Although evidence suggests that physical disability, general health, and pain relief are better with VP and KP than those with medical management within the first 3 months after intervention, high-quality randomized trials with 2-year follow-up are needed to confirm this. Furthermore, the reported incidence of symptomatic procedure-related morbidity for both VP and KP is very low.},

  abstract={Osteoporotic vertebral fractures and pathological vertebral lesions are frequent clinical situations causing severe back pain. The pharmacological treatment of the underlying disease and the analgetic treatment of the associated back pain usually do not rid the patient's back pain completely and are insufficient to prevent the fracture-weakened vertebral body from further fracturing with long term consequences for the biomechanical competence of the entire spine. In the last 10 years the minimal invasive treatment options vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BK) have spread quickly because these procedures appeared to be promising treatments to stop the fracture and vertebral lesion associated back pain and to internally stabilize a fractured vertebral body. Numerous published reports on VP and BK appeared to support the notion of an immediate and lasting pain reduction after VP and BK in additon to a prevention of further fracturing of the treated vertebrae. The first three randomized controlled and partly blinded trials have been published this year. Two of these trials demonstrate that VP does not result in a better pain control than a sham operation whereas BK was shown to reduce back pain due to verterbal fractures for at least 12 months. Considering that more than 1.5 million people world-wide have been treated with VP and BK until now this work discusses the recent trials and suggests clinical and academic consequences on the basis of the most recent evidence.},

Cement bone augmentation has become very popular worldwide in treating painful noncomplicated spine fractures. Controversy about the effectiveness was raised by two randomized trials in 2009. Recent new evidence contradicts those findings giving credit to vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty.
Recent findings: 
Well designed prospective clinical trials in cancer and noncancer vertebral fractures as well as an excellent meta-analysis showed that painful vertebral compression fractures have better and faster pain relief, better functional outcomes, and with low complication rate when treated with percutaneous cement than conservatively.
Summary: 
The saga is unfinished. The treatment of vertebral compression fractures with cement augmentation is still in its infancy. The potential for development with new materials and the injection of biologic and active bone cements or anticancer products, in metastatic disease, will revolutionize the treatment of this condition.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral compression fractures are a common pathology affecting primarily the elderly, postmenopausal women, and those with metastatic vertebral disease. Vertebral augmentation procedures are popular treatment options for stability and pain relief. Preliminary studies have suggested that such procedures are adequately efficacious. However, the first randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 showed that these procedures were not significantly different than placebo with regards to pain relief and quality of life. These studies were met with considerable criticism. The matter was further complicated when The Lancet published an RCT of its own that demonstrated the superiority of vertebroplasty over conservative management. The conflicting evidence has sparked ongoing debate in the medical community. All sides have provided arguments supported by evidence of varying strength and validity.
Objective: 
To provide a concise and comprehensive presentation of the controversy surrounding vertebral augmentation procedures and the evidence cited by proponents on both sides of the debate.
Methods: 
We began by researching the major randomized controlled trials both for and against vertebroplasty. These articles were already known to us, and were used as a starting point. We then performed a literature search in PubMed for articles dated from 2000 through 2012. The bibliographies of major articles and reviews were also cross-referenced for additional sources.
Results: 
A number of articles that included comprehensive and systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and commentaries about noted studies were found. These provided a broad, detailed overview of the subject. Many of the common themes of these articles included limitations in the design, methods, and patient selection with regard to the RCTs and other available studies.
Limitations: 
This review does not analyze the quality of evidence available nor does it provide an opinion in this regard. The conclusions of the present article are, therefore, general and descriptive in nature.
Conclusions: 
The arguments presented by proponents of both sides of the debate appear to have validity. All of the major studies cited as evidence for or against vertebral augmentation procedures have limitations in their quality. Consequently, the debate cannot be concluded, convincingly, until more elaborate studies are conducted involving larger numbers of patients with clear procedure methods agreed upon by the major authorities in the field.},

  abstract={Object: 
The surgical approach and treatment of thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficit have not been documented in detail. Anterior surgery provides good decompression and solid fusion, but the surgery-related risk is relatively higher than that associated with the posterior approach. In posterior surgery, the major problem after posterior correction and instrumentation is failure to support the anterior spinal column, leading to loss of correction of kyphosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of reinforcing short-segment posterior fixation with vertebroplasty and to compare the outcome with those of posterior surgery without vertebroplasty and anterior surgery, retrospectively.
Methods: 
The authors studied 83 patients who underwent surgical treatment for a single thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficit. Twenty-eight patients treated by posterior surgery combined with vertebroplasty (Group A), 25 patients treated by posterior surgery without vertebroplasty (Group B), and 30 patients treated by anterior surgery (Group C) were followed up for a mean postoperative period of 4.4 years. Neurological outcome, visual analog scale pain score, and radiographic results were compared in the 3 groups.
Results: 
Postoperative (4-6 weeks) and follow-up neurological outcome and visual analog scale scores were not significantly different among the 3 groups. Postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly reduced in Group B compared with Group C (p = 0.007), whereas the kyphotic angle was not significantly different among the 3 groups at follow-up. The mean ± SD loss of correction at follow-up was 4.6° ± 4.5°, 8.6° ± 6.2°, and 4.5° ± 5.9° in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The correction loss at follow-up in Group B was significantly higher compared with Groups A and C (p = 0.0171 and p = 0.0180, respectively).
Conclusions: 
The results suggest that additional reinforcement with vertebroplasty reduces the kyphotic loss and instrumentation failure, compared with patients without the reinforcement of vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty-augmented short-segment fixation seems to offer immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse; the effect seems equivalent to that of anterior reconstruction.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a frequently encountered clinical problem. We aimed to perform a critical, structured review of the current literature and to compare the results with our own experiences.
Material and methods: 
A structured review of 7 studies about vertebroplasty in osteoporotic compression fractures was performed; each study assessed at least 16 patients and was published in English since 1997. The results were compared to our own experience in 22 patients treated in 2002.
Results: 
Over the past decade, vertebroplasty has increasingly been performed for the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. In good correlation with our own results, all authors reported a significant improvement of pain immediately after treatment and a reduction of pain of up to 90% within 24 h after vertebroplasty. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the use of analgetics and a substantial improvement of functional status has been described in recent studies. In our own evaluation, we were also able to demonstrate a significant improvement of pain after vertebroplasty in 17 of 22 (77%) of our patients. 18 of 22 (82%) patients were able to diminish or even discontinue their analgesic medication.
Discussion: 
Reported results for vertebroplasty have demonstrated a rapid improvement in pain and physical functioning in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Percutaneous vertebroplasty has proven to provide a valuable treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: 
Vertebroplasty is frequently offered to patients hospitalized for refractory pain due to vertebral fractures, because it is assumed that the procedure will facilitate resolution of pain and a rapid hospital discharge. We report our experience with inpatient vertebroplasty, with attention to rapidity of discharge and relevant clinical parameters.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed the duration of hospitalization in patients admitted with primary diagnoses of back pain or vertebral fracture who were treated with vertebroplasty. We cataloged outcomes in the form of verbal pain scales (graded 0-10), in-hospital medication use (graded 0-6), and posthospitalization medication use. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postvertebroplasty.
Results: 
We identified 66 such patients who had a median total hospital stay of 6.0 days (range, 1-26 days). Median length of stay before and after vertebroplasty were 4.0 (range, 1-24 days) and 1.5 days (range, 0-7 days), respectively. Ten (15%) patients were discharged the day of vertebroplasty. By days 2 and 3, 33 (50%) and 48 (72.7%) of the 66 patients had been discharged. Patients who received vertebroplasty earlier in the course of hospitalization demonstrated greater decreases in medication strength by discharge (P = .045). There was significant improvement in all outcome measures by 1 week, with continued improvement at 1 and 6 months.
Conclusion: 
This study confirms that vertebroplasty facilitates a rapid hospital discharge as well as long-term improvement in patients admitted for refractory pain. Vertebroplasty administered earlier in hospitalization also leads to greater decreases in analgesic requirements.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
This study assessed whether vertebroplasty increases trabecular bone microfractures in adjacent vertebrae of elderly female cadavers. Results indicated microfractures were almost two times greater in superior adjacent vertebrae for vertebroplasty treated spines compared to non-treated controls. This finding may aid in developing improved treatments for osteoporotic women with vertebral fractures.
Introduction: 
Although vertebroplasty may stabilize compression fractures and reduce pain, subsequent vertebral fractures occur in approximately 25 % of patients, reducing the overall safety of this procedure. This is particularly a concern in vertebrae surrounding the treated level where bone cement may cause abnormal transfer of forces to adjacent spinal structures. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the effects of vertebroplasty on local trabecular bone damage in adjacent vertebrae.
Methods: 
Five level motion segments (T11-L3) from osteopenic/osteoporotic female cadaver spines (T-score -2.9 ± 1.0) were assigned into either vertebroplasty or control (no vertebroplasty) groups (n = 10/group) such that T-score, trabecular microarchitecture, and age were similar between groups. Compression fractures were created in the L 1 vertebra of all specimens and PMMA bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebra of vertebroplasty specimens. All spine segments were subjected to cyclic axial compression (685-1370 N) for 115,000 cycles. Post-testing, trabecular cubes were cut from adjacent (T12 and L2) vertebral bodies and histologically processed. Trabecular microfractures were identified and normalized by bone area in each section.
Results: 
There were significantly more trabecular microfractures (p < 0.001) in superior adjacent vertebral bodies of the vertebroplasty group (0.091 ± 0.025 microfractures/mm(2)) when compared to the control group (0.049 ± 0.018 microfractures/mm(2)). However, there was no difference in trabecular microfractures (p = 0.835) between vertebroplasty (0.045 ± 0.022 microfractures/mm(2)) and control groups (0.035 ± 0.013 microfractures/mm(2)) for inferior adjacent vertebral bodies.
Conclusions: 
Vertebroplasty specifically impacts the superior adjacent vertebrae of elderly female spines resulting in almost two times more trabecular microfractures when compared to non-treated controls.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) using PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) was first described in 1987 by Gallibert and Deramond for the treatment of vertebral body instability in patients with aggressive forms of vertebral hemangioma. Other types of painful osteolytic bone lesions, such as osteoporotic vertebral fractures and vertebral metastasis are in the meantime more commonly treated using this method.
Methodical innovations: 
Within the last few years, this technique has become widely accepted and it is proposed for osteolytic bone lesions in areas that are more difficult to approach surgically, e.g., the pelvis and sacrum.
Efficacy: 
Rapid pain relief and resulting stability have conferred an important role upon osteoplasty especially in palliative tumor-treatment for patients with shortened expected life spans. In addition, combined treatment of painful osteolytic metastases with image-guided thermoablation and percutaneous cement injection has been shown to be a safe palliative modality in the therapy of nonresectable tumors.},

  abstract={Background: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty is increasingly used for treatment of pain in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, but the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety of the procedure remain uncertain. We aimed to clarify whether vertebroplasty has additional value compared with optimum pain treatment in patients with acute vertebral fractures.
Methods: 
Patients were recruited to this open-label prospective randomised trial from the radiology departments of six hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Patients were aged 50 years or older, had vertebral compression fractures on spine radiograph (minimum 15% height loss; level of fracture at Th5 or lower; bone oedema on MRI), with back pain for 6 weeks or less, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 5 or more. Patients were randomly allocated to percutaneous vertebroplasty or conservative treatment by computer-generated randomisation codes with a block size of six. Masking was not possible for participants, physicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was pain relief at 1 month and 1 year as measured by VAS score. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00232466.
Findings: 
Between Oct 1, 2005, and June 30, 2008, we identified 431 patients who were eligible for randomisation. 229 (53%) patients had spontaneous pain relief during assessment, and 202 patients with persistent pain were randomly allocated to treatment (101 vertebroplasty, 101 conservative treatment). Vertebroplasty resulted in greater pain relief than did conservative treatment; difference in mean VAS score between baseline and 1 month was -5·2 (95% CI -5·88 to -4·72) after vertebroplasty and -2·7 (-3·22 to -1·98) after conservative treatment, and between baseline and 1 year was -5·7 (-6·22 to -4·98) after vertebroplasty and -3·7 (-4·35 to -3·05) after conservative treatment. The difference between groups in reduction of mean VAS score from baseline was 2·6 (95% CI 1·74-3·37, p<0·0001) at 1 month and 2·0 (1·13-2·80, p<0·0001) at 1 year. No serious complications or adverse events were reported.
Interpretation: 
In a subgroup of patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and persistent pain, percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective and safe. Pain relief after vertebroplasty is immediate, is sustained for at least a year, and is significantly greater than that achieved with conservative treatment, at an acceptable cost.

Cement augmentation is widely performed and its complications and mechanical limitations are well described. Implants avoiding the side effects of cement augmentation while reaching the same level of stability would be desirable. The primary and secondary stability of a new augmentation method with self-locking hexagonal metal implants were investigated and compared with the performance of established augmentation options. 18 fresh-frozen human spinal specimens (Th12-L2/L3-L5) were tested with pure moments of 7.5 Nm in a six-degree-of-freedom spine simulator to investigate primary and secondary stability of three augmentation techniques: (1) vertebroplasty, (2) PMMA filled cavity and (3) hexagonal metal implants. An increasing three-step cyclic loading model was included. Elastic displacement and height loss under loading did not show significant differences between the three test groups. Investigation of primary and secondary stability evenly demonstrated comparable results for all techniques indicating an insufficiency to stabilise the fracture with higher load cycles. The newly introduced method for augmentation with the metal implant Spine Pearls achieved comparable results to bone cement based techniques in a biomechanical in vitro study. Midterm and longterm reduction preservation and ingrowth of the implants have to be proven in further studies.},

  abstract={Background: 
Kyphoplasty is a proven minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of patients with osteoporotic fractures. By augmentation of fractured vertebral body, however, a very large portion of the intervertebral structures will be destroyed. With the help of a new device (Vertect Jack Device), the erection of the vertebral body will be carried out more gentle.
Objective: 
In the present study, the new method should be clinically tested for efficacy and safety for the first time. As a comparison results of previous treatments with kyphoplasty were used.
Methods: 
For Vertect Jack Device study patients with painful vertebral fractures were selected in which conservative treatment had not yielded sufficient results. For comparison random data from the records of patients who had been treated with kyphoplasty were selected. The Vertect Jack Device was placed under the central fractures and then erected. After having restorted the vertebral height the device was removed and cement injected. Clinical and radiological examinations were carried out before and after 1,3, and 6 months.
Results: 
In the Vertect Jack Device Group the data of 40 patients were evaluated. For group 2 (kyphoplasty) 50 patients were selected. There was a significant difference in the duration of the surgery (Group 1: 27.4, Group 2: 45.9 minutes). A significant difference of 20 mm with regard to the reduction of VAS scores (0-100 mm pain intensity) was detected. Under the application of the Vertect Jack Device an average increase of 3.1 mm of vertebral height was achieved. In group 2, the erection averaged 0.4 mm. A correlation between the postoperative change of vertebral body height and VAS scores could not be detected in both groups.
Conclusions: 
The comparative analysis of this study shows that promising results can be achieved with the augmentation of vertebral fractures with the Vertect Jack Device. When compared with kyphoplasty, advantages show in terms of targeted and thus more gentle application possibility and better pain relief over a period of 6 months after surgery. Further study results should help to demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability of the new method.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Prospective study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safe range of cement volume during percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
A few clinical reports have addressed the relationship between cement volume and clinical outcome. However, the weakness of these studies was that subjects included were not homogeneous. No study in the clinical setting has confirmed results from biomechanical and computational studies.
Methods: 
We examined 96 patients with single compression fractures who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty and postoperative three-dimensional CT scan within a week between June 2006 and April 2009. The volume and fraction were measured by a CT volumetry program. Relationships between predictors and volumetric data, outcome, leakage, intraverterbal vacuum cleft (IVVC), and subsequent fracture were examined. Relationships between volumetric data and outcome, leakage, IVVC, and subsequent fracture were analyzed with stratification by the treated level. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to acquire cut-off values of volumetric data.
Results: 
Seventy-three patients (76%) were female, and the mean age was 76.3 ± 8.4 years (range 53-97). The mean duration of follow-up was 11 months (range 6-21). Locations were as follows: T4-T10 9, T11-L1-L57, and L2-L4 30. Seventy-eight patients (81%) reported a favorable outcome. Fractured body volume (FBV) and the level treated were associated with fraction, which had an influence on outcome. The fraction of the favorable group was significantly higher. Cut-off values to acquire a favorable outcome were 11.64% (P = 0.026) on the T4-L4 level and 3.35 cm (P = 0.059), 11.65% (P = 0.059) on the T11-L1 level. Group with intradiscal leakage had a smaller volume than nonleakage group on the L2-L4 level (3.86 cm vs. 5.65 cm, P = 0.002). There were no relationships of volumetric data with epidural leakage and pulmonary embolism. The presence of IVVC increased volume on the T4-L4 and L2-L4 level (P < 0.03). Larger volume increased significantly the incidence of adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. The significant cut-off volume to avoid adjacent fracture was 4.90 cm on the ROC curve.
Conclusion: 
It is suggested that fraction is superior to volume for predicting outcome on the T11-L1 level and an amount of cement should be determined in terms of FBV and fraction according to the treated level. A lower fraction than required for the restoration of mechanical property was enough to obtain pain relief. Intradiscal leakage on the L2-L4 level may be inevitable to obtain appropriate mechanical properties in the case of severe endplate breakdown connected with the disc space. Smaller volume is needed to avoid an adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. Although we did not know the reason why there was a difference among the treated level groups, one thing that is certain is the fact that level-specific approaches may be necessary for good outcome in terms of volume, fraction and FBV.},

  abstract={Local post-traumatic kyphosis may impair spinal sagittal balance and result in severe disability. The goal of this study is to evaluate posterior closing wedge osteotomy at the level of injury, by comparing thoracolumbar (T12-L1) and lumbar (L2-4) spinal levels. Thirteen consecutive patients had surgery in an average 13 months after the initial injury. There were 8 thoracolumbar and 5 lumbar deformities. Nine patients already had posterior fixation. Eight patients had preoperative neurological deficits. Sagittal correction was assessed in terms of regional angulation (RA) and effective regional deformity (ERD), which was defined as the difference between the actual RA and the physiological RA for the level. The average follow up was 2.1 years. The average RA passed from 43.8 degrees (31 to 55) to 2.2 degrees (-5 to 7) after surgery. It was 5.3 degrees (-4 to 12), at follow-up. RA and surgical correction were not significantly different between thoracolumbar and lumbar groups. The average ERD was 47.2 degrees (24 to 66) preoperatively and 8.6 degrees (-5 to 37) at follow-up. The ERD passed from 41.8 degrees (24 to 54) to 0.5 degrees (-5 to 6) in the thoracolumbar group, and from 55.8 degrees (50 to 66) to 21.6 degrees (17 to 37) in the lumbar group. The ERD was significantly different initially (P=0.014) and after surgery (P=0.06). The anatomical result was complete in the thoracolumbar group, because the correction of the deformity at this level does not require more than correction of the vertebral body kyphosis. On the contrary, due to adjacent disc damage, the technique did not fully restore the physiological regional lordosis at lower levels.},

  abstract={Unlabelled: 
We investigated the importance, risk factors, and clinical course of the radiolucent "halo" phenomenon around bone cement following vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic compression fracture. Preoperative osteonecrosis and a lump cement pattern were the most important risk factors for the peri-cement halo phenomenon, and it was associated with vertebral recollapse.
Introduction: 
We observed a newly developed radiolucent area around the bone cement following vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic compression fractures. Here, we describe the importance of the peri-cement halo phenomenon, as well as any associated risk factors and long-term sequelae.
Methods: 
In total, 175 patients (202 treated vertebrae) were enrolled in this study. The treated vertebrae were subdivided into two groups: Group A (with halo, n = 32) and Group B (without halo, n = 170), and the groups were compared with respect to multiple preoperative (age, sex, BMD, preoperative osteonecrosis) and perioperative factors (operative approach: vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty; cement distribution pattern; cement leakage; cement volume), and postoperative results (VAS score, recollapse). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the incidence of the peri-cement halo and all of the parameters described above.
Results: 
Rates of osteonecrosis were also significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (62.5% vs. 31.2%, p < 0.05), and kyphoplasty (KP) was performed more frequently in Group A (43.8% vs. 17.6%, p < 0.05). Lump cement (93.8% vs. 30.6%, p < 0.05) and recollapse (78.1% vs. 24.7%, p < 0.05) were also more common among individuals in Group A. Logistic regression analysis also showed that preoperative osteonecrosis (OR = 3.679; 95% CI = 1.677-8.073; p = 0.001), KP (OR = 3.630; 95% CI = 1.628-8.095; p = 0.002), lump pattern (OR = 13.870; 95% CI = 2.907-66.188; p = 0.001), and vertebral recollapse (OR = 5.356; 95% CI = 1.897-15.122; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with peri-cement halo.
Conclusions: 
The peri-cement halo was found to be associated with vertebral recollapse, this sign likely represents a poor prognostic factor after vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic compression fractures.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
After dorsal stabilisation of vertebral fractures by an internal fixateur the postoperative computed tomography is a standard procedure to control the positions of the pedicle screws, the success of the reposition, the clearance of the spinal canal and to plane an additive secondary ventral stabilisation. An intraoperative scan with a 3D image intensifier may clarify these questions directly after the implantation with the possibility of an immediate correction of the implants. The aim of this study was to find out the optimal point of time to perform an intraoperative 3D scan and if a postoperative computed tomography is dispensable.
Patients and methods: 
Intraoperative 3D scans were carried out on 33 patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures (T11-L5) after bi-segmental fixateur interne montage (Group 1). A matched pair group of 33 patients (Group 2) with a 3D scan after implantation of pedicle screws was built. A postoperative computed tomography of the instrumented spinal section was done in all patients. The following measurements were done in sagittal and axial reconstruction planes and were compared: classification of screw positions, maximal axial diameter of pedicles, cortical perforation of the screws. Additionally in Group 1 the distance between the upper and lower end plates of the injured section, the height of posterior vertebral body wall, the dislocation of the posterior wall and the minimal diameter of the spinal canal were measured.
Results: 
The intraoperative scoring of pedicle screws positions and the measurement of pedicle width showed in both groups a significant accordance with the computed tomography determinations. The measurements "posterior wall dislocation" and "diameter of spinal canal" were only possible in 24 3D scans and showed a significant difference compared with the CT data. The picture quality in Group 2 was scored significantly better than for Group 1 with the complete assembly of the fixateur.
Conclusion: 
The ideal point of time for an intraoperative 3D imaging with the present intensifier generation is directly after pedicle screw insertion. The reliable determination of the spinal canal diameter, of posterior wall fragments and of the exact fracture morphology is only possible by postoperative computed tomography.},

  abstract={Background: 
Clinical outcomes of intravenous (IV) infusion of zoledronic acid (ZOL) for lumbar interbody fusion surgery (LIFS) remain unknown. We investigated the efficacy of IV ZOL on clinical outcome and bone fusion after LIFS.
Materials and methods: 
We retrospectively analyzed 64 patients with both degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and osteoporosis who underwent LIFS from January 2007 to April 2010. All patients were followed up for 2 y. Thirty-two were treated with an IV infusion of ZOL 3 d after surgery and a second injection 1 y later, and the other 32 patients did not receive ZOL. Preoperatively and every 3 mo postoperatively, oswestry disability index questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for back and leg were compared. Preoperative and final postoperative follow-up to evaluate for subsequent compression fractures were also performed. Pedicle screw loosening, cage subsidence, and fusion rate were documented 2 y after surgery.
Results: 
At 2-y follow-up, a solid fusion was achieved in 75% of the ZOL group and only 56% of the control group. At final follow up, the incidence of final subsequent vertebral compression fractures (19% of the ZOL group and 51% of the control group, P = 0.006), pedicle screw loosening (18% of the ZOL group and 45% of the control group, P = 0.03), and cage subsidence >2 mm (28% of the ZOL group and only 54% of the control group, P = 0.04) were significantly lower in the ZOL group than in the control group. The ZOL group demonstrated improvement in VAS (for leg pain VAS, 2/10 for the ZOL group and 5/10 for the control group; for back pain VAS, 2/10 for the ZOL group and 6/10 for the control group) and oswestry disability index scores (7/25 for the ZOL group and 16/25 for the control group).
Conclusions: 
ZOL treatment has beneficial effects on instrumented LIFS both radiographic and clinically. Thus, ZOL treatment can be recommended for osteoporosis patients undergoing LIFS.},

This study evaluated the benefits of ZOL versus placebo on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients from HORIZON-RFT. At month 24 and end of the study visit, ZOL significantly improved patients' overall health state compared to placebo as assessed by the EQ-5D VAS.
Introduction: 
To evaluate the benefits of zoledronic acid (ZOL) versus placebo on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients from The Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence With Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly Recurrent Fracture Trial (HORIZON-RFT).
Methods: 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 2,127 patients were randomized to receive annual infusion of ZOL 5 mg (n = 1,065) or placebo (n = 1,062) within 90 days after surgical repair of low-trauma hip fracture. HRQoL was measured using EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and utility scores (EuroQol instrument) at months 6, 12, 24, 36, and end of the study visit. Analysis of covariance model included baseline EQ-5D value, region, and treatment as explanatory variables.
Results: 
At baseline, patients (mean age 75 years; 24% men and 76% women) were well matched between treatment groups with mean EQ-5D VAS of 65.82 in ZOL and 65.70 in placebo group. At the end of the study, mean change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS was greater for ZOL vs. placebo in all patients (7.67 ± 0.56 vs. 5.42 ± 0.56), and in subgroups of patients experiencing clinical vertebral fractures (8.86 ± 4.91 vs. -1.69 ± 3.42), non-vertebral fractures (5.03 ± 2.48 vs. -1.07 ± 2.16), and clinical fractures (5.19 ± 2.25 vs. -0.72 ± 1.82) with treatment difference significantly in favor of ZOL. EQ-5D utility scores were comparable for ZOL and placebo groups, but more patients on placebo consistently had extreme difficulty in mobility (1.74% for ZOL vs. 2.13% for placebo; p = 0.6238), self-care (4.92% vs. 6.69%; p = 0.1013), and usual activities (10.28% vs. 12.91%; p = 0.0775).
Conclusion: 
ZOL significantly improves HRQoL in patients with low-trauma hip fracture.},
