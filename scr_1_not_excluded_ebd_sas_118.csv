To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) and open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) in the treatment of single level of thoracolumbar fracture.
Methods: 
Databases including Pubmed, Embasem, CNKI were searched to collect clinical trials of the clinical safety and efficiency of PPSF and OPSF for single level of thoracolumbar unstable fracture, relevant proceedings and references were also retrieved manually. Studies from 1990 to 2014 that met the inclusion and exclusion standards were researched. The data were extracted and the methods from the studies were also evaluated. Data analysis was conducted with the Review Manager 5.3 software. Observation targets included operation time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative bleeding, hospitalization time, the bed time, postoperative vertebral Cobb angle, vertebral body height, pain score and the length of incision operation.
Results: 
Fifteen papers were finally studied, including 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 13 case-control studies, involving 789 patients. Compared with OPSF, the PPSF in treating thoracolumbar fracture had shorter operation time, smaller operation incision, less intraoperative and postoperation bleeding, shorter hospitalization days, fewer pain (P<0.00001), the less improvement in the change of Cobb angle (P=0.0006). There was no significant difference in the improvement of vertebral body height (P=0.36), the bed time from operation to exercise (P=0.38) between OPSF and PPSF.
Conclusion: 
Compared with OPSF, PPSF is better, safer, and has fewer pain. But there is no evidence that the PPSF is better in the recovery of the spinal height, and they have the same effect in the long-term follow-up for thoracolumbar fractures. PPSF brines minimally invasive to patients with better effect. It is worth further study and clinical research."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment of a stable burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction in neurologically intact patients have not shown a meaningful difference at early follow-up. To our knowledge, longer-term outcome data have not before been presented.
Methods: 
From 1992 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were evaluated and randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative treatment (posterior or anterior arthrodesis) or nonoperative treatment (a body cast or orthosis). We previously reported the results of follow-up at an average of forty-four months. The current study presents the results of long-term follow-up, at an average of eighteen years (range, sixteen to twenty-two years). As in the earlier study, patients at long-term follow-up indicated the degree of pain on a visual analog scale and completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Work and health status were obtained, and patients were evaluated radiographically.
Results: 
Of the original operatively treated group of twenty-four patients, follow-up data were obtained for nineteen; one patient had died, and four could not be located. Of the original nonoperatively treated group of twenty-three patients, data were obtained for eighteen; two patients had died, and three could not be located. The average kyphosis was not significantly different between the two groups (13° for those who received operative treatment compared with 19° for those treated nonoperatively). Median scores for pain (4 cm for the operative group and 1.5 cm for the nonoperative group; p = 0.003), ODI scores (20 for the operative group and 2 for the nonoperative group; p <0.001) and Roland and Morris scores (7 for the operative group and 1 for the nonoperative group; p = 0.001) were all significantly better in the group treated nonoperatively. Seven of eight SF-36 scores also favored nonoperative treatment.
Conclusions: 
While early analysis (four years) revealed few significant differences between the two groups, at long-term follow-up (sixteen to twenty-two years), those with a stable burst fracture who were treated nonoperatively reported less pain and better function compared with those who were treated surgically."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The surgical results of treating thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were reported to be comparable between patients with and without fusion in an intermediate-term follow-up. To our knowledge, no prior report has compared the results of fusion and non-fusion with long-term follow-up.
Methods: 
This study was designed to provide long-term evaluation of patients with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine treated with short-segment fixation who were randomly assigned to a fusion or non-fusion group. Patients older than sixty years of age at the time of injury and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough Low-Back Outcome Score and the visual analog scale for back pain. Radiographic outcomes were focused on the vertebral body height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the regional segmental motion.
Results: 
Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the non-fusion group, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the fusion group. The average follow-up period was 134 months (range, 121 to 161 months). The average preoperative kyphotic angle was 16.4° for the non-fusion group and 19.5° for the fusion group. The average postoperative kyphotic angle was 1.5° for the non-fusion group and 4.0° for the fusion group. At the time of the latest follow-up, the average kyphotic angle was 13.8° for the non-fusion group and 14.7° for the fusion group. The average kyphotic angle between the two groups was similar at all follow-up times. A progressive decrease of the kyphotic angle was significant (p < 0.05) with time, regardless of fusion. The radiographic outcomes were similar between these two groups at all follow-up times, as were functional outcomes. More patients in the non-fusion group underwent additional surgery to remove implants. Regional segmental motion was preserved in the non-fusion group, with a mean motion (and standard deviation) of 4.2° ± 1.9°.
Conclusions: 
The long-term results of short segmental fixation with and without fusion for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were comparable. Regional segmental motion could be preserved without fusion, and bone graft donor site complications could be eliminated.

Seventy patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures were treated by short-segment pedicle screw fixation and were randomly divided into two groups. Fractures in group A (n=20) were reinforced with posterior morselized bone grafting in vertebrae for spinal fusion, while patients group B (n=50) did not receive the morselized bone grafting for bone fusion. The two groups were compared in terms of kyphotic deformity, anterior vertebral height, instrument failure and neurological functions after the treatment. Frankel grading system was used for the evaluation of neurological evaluation and Denis scoring scale was employed for pain assessment. The results showed that the kyphosis correction was achieved in both group A and group B (group A: 6.4 degree; group B: 5.4 degree)/ At the end of follow-up, kyphosis correction was maintained in group A but lost in group B (P=0.0001). Postoperatively, greater anterior height was achieved in group A than in group B (P<0.01). During follow-up study, anterior vertebral height was maintained only in Group A (P<0.001). Both group A and group B showed good Denis pain scores (P1 and P2) but group A outdid group B in terms of control of severe and constant pain (P4 and P5). By Frankel criteria, the changes in neurological functions in group A was better than those of group B (P<0.001). It is concluded that reinforcement of short-segment pedicle fixation with morselized bone grafting for the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture could achieve and maintain kyphosis correction, and it may also increase and maintain anterior vertebral height. Morselized bone grafting in vertebrae offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures, decreases the instrument failure and provides better postoperative pain control than without the morselized bone grafting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Thoracolumbar junction burst fractures remain a challenging problem due to controversy over the treatment choice of short- or long-segment posterior fixation. The aim of the present study was to compare life quality and sexual function of patients after short- and long-segment posterior fixations in the treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.
Methods: 
In this prospective, randomized study, 24 sexually active male patients diagnosed with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures were randomly assigned to either the short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) group or the long-segment posterior fixation group (LLPF). The exclusion criteria were rheumatological disease and spinal surgery history. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index or smoking habits between the groups. The life quality score of EQ-5D and the International Index of erectile function (IIEF-5) score of male patients and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score of female partners were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.
Results: 
The mean age of patients in the SSPF and LSPF groups was 44.58 and 42.92 years, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the preoperative EQ-5D and IIEF-5 scores of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners. Postoperatively, the EQ-5D scores (p = 0.011) and IIEF-5 scores (p = 0.000) of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners (p = 0.001) were better in the short-segment group.
Conclusions: 
Patients treated with SSPF have better sexual function and life quality with their partners compared to those treated with LSPF. The main clinical relevance of this study is that the impact of the choice of short or long-segment treatment on postoperative sexual function and life quality should be considered by surgeons when performing posterior fixation after thoracolumbar junction burst fractures."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Prospective, 2-center, observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
Objective: 
Investigate clinical and radiologic outcomes of bracing versus no-bracing in the treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Management of thoracolumbar burst fractures depends upon clinical presentation of neurological deficit and radiographic features of fracture severity. Neurologically intact patients with mild deformity and biomechanical stability may be treated with conservative therapy.
Methods: 
Patients with stable (AO type A3), single level, thoracolumbar burst fractures between T12 and L2 with no neurological deficit were randomized to nonoperative treatment with a customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) or no-brace. Self-reported clinical outcomes of pain, disability, and health-related quality of life, and radiographic outcomes of kyphotic progression and loss of vertebral height, assessed by 2 independent reviewers blinded to treatment group, were measured at 6 months follow-up.
Results: 
Twenty-three consecutive eligible patients were included (TLSO: n=12; no-brace: n=11). There were no between-group differences regarding level of injury (P=0.75) and baseline spine geometry including fractional canal compromise (P=0.49), anterior loss of vertebral body height (P=0.28), and sagittal Cobb angle (P=0.13). In-hospital stay was significantly shorter in the no-brace group (mean: 2.8±3.0 d) compared with the TLSO group (mean: 6.3±2.1 d; P=0.004). At follow-up there were no differences in anterior loss of vertebral body height (TLSO: 12.5%±10.2% vs. no-brace: 11.9%±8.1%; P=0.88), kyphotic progression (TLSO: 5.3±4.4 degrees vs. no-brace 5.2±3.6 degrees; P=0.93), adverse events, or self-reported clinical outcomes.
Conclusions: 
Neurologically intact patients with stable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with or without bracing had similar radiographic and clinical outcomes at 6 months follow-up. The no-brace group had shorter in-hospital lengths of stay. Conservative therapy involving early mobilization without brace immobilization may be warranted. Further studies with a larger series of patients and longer follow-up are required for conclusive findings."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 8 - не хирургия [Records Excluded Step 8 No Surgery in the Spine]"

The percutaneous insertion technique requires surgical skill and experience. However, there have been few clinical reports evaluating the accuracy of minimally invasive pedicle screw placement using the conventional fluoroscopy method. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of percutaneous pedicle screw placement in the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures using two-plane conventional fluoroscopy.
Methods: 
A prospective clinical trial was performed. A total of 502 percutaneous pedicle screws in 111 patients, all inserted with the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy, were evaluated. The safety and accuracy of pedicle screw placement were based on the evaluation of postoperative axial 3-mm slice computed tomography scans using the scoring system described by Zdichavsky et al.

Results: 
427/502 pedicle screws (85 %) were classified as good and excellent concerning the best possible screw length and 494/502 (98 %) were found to have good or excellent position. One screw had to be revised due to medial position with a neurological deficit.
Conclusions: 
This study demonstrates the feasibility of placing percutaneous posterior thoracolumbar pedicle screws with the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy.

Decision-making regarding nonoperative versus operative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in the absence of neurologic deficits is controversial. Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately and being exposed to unnecessary adverse consequences.
Purpose: 
Using meta-analysis, we therefore compared pain (VAS) and function (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit treated nonoperatively and operatively. Secondary outcomes included return to work, radiographic progression of kyphosis, radiographic progression of spinal canal stenosis, complications, cost, and length of hospitalization.
Methods: 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE(®), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for 'thoracic fractures', 'lumbar fractures', 'non-operative', 'operative' and 'controlled clinical trials'. We established five criteria for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The main analyses were performed on individual patient data from randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed on VAS pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score, kyphosis, and return to work, including data from nonrandomized controlled trials and using fixed effects meta-analysis. We identified four trials, including two randomized controlled trials consisting of 79 patients (41 with operative treatment and 38 with nonoperative treatment). The mean followups ranged from 24 to 118 months.
Results: 
We found no between-group differences in baseline pain, kyphosis, and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. At last followup, there were no between-group differences in pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores, and return to work rates. We found an improvement in kyphosis ranging from means of 12.8º to 11º in the operative group, but surgery was associated with higher complication rates and costs.
Conclusions: 
Operative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit may improve residual kyphosis, but does not appear to improve pain or function at an average of 4 years after injury and is associated with higher complication rates and costs.

Summary of background data: 
Most authors reported that intraoperative correction of sagittal deformity is important for the maintenance of fracture reduction and is one of the most consistent predictor of satisfactory functional outcome.
Methods: 
Seventy-two patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomized into 4 groups with equal number of patients.

The impact of fusion as a supplement to short-segment instrumentation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is unclear. We conducted a controlled clinical trial to define the effect of fusion on lumbar spine and patient-related functional outcomes.
Methods: 
From 2000 to 2002, seventy-three consecutive patients with a single-level Denis type-B burst fracture involving the thoracolumbar spine and a load-sharing score of <or=6 were managed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with posterolateral fusion (fusion group, n = 37) or without posterolateral fusion (nonfusion group, n = 36). The patients were followed for at least five years after surgery and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with use of the Frankel scale, the motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, a visual analog scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Radiographic outcomes were assessed on the basis of the local kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.
Results: 
No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between the patients managed with the two techniques. Both operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the nonfusion group compared with the fusion group (p < 0.05). Twenty-five of the thirty-seven patients in the fusion group still had some degree of donor-site pain at the time of the latest examination.

A prospective clinical trial was conducted.
Objectives: 
To compare the results of fusion versus nonfusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine.
Summary of background data: 
The operative results of surgically treated burst fractures with short segmental fixation have been well documented. There is no report comparing the results of fusion and nonfusion.
Methods: 
Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, with the inclusion criteria as follows: neurologically intact spine with a kyphotic angle > or = 20 degrees, decreased vertebral body height > or = 50% or a canal compromise > or = 50%, incomplete neurologic deficit with a canal compromise 50%, complete neurologic deficit, and multilevel spinal injury or multiple traumas. All patients were randomly assigned to fusion or nonfusion groups, and operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation was carried out. Posterior fusion with autogenous bone graft was performed for the fusion group (n = 30), and no fusion procedure was done for the nonfusion group (n = 28). The average follow-up period was 41 months (range, 24-71 months).
Results: 
The average loss of kyphotic angle was not statistically significant between these 2 groups. The radiographic parameters were statistically significantly better in the nonfusion group, including angular change in the flexion-extension lateral view (4.8 degrees vs. 1.0 degrees), lost correction of decreased vertebral body height (3.6% vs. 8.3%), intraoperative estimated blood loss (303 mL vs. 572 mL), and operative time (162 minutes vs. 224 minutes). The scores on the low back outcome scale were not statistically significant for these 2 groups.
Conclusions: 
The short-term results of short segmental fixation without fusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were satisfactory. The advantages of instrumentation without fusion are the elimination of donor site complications, saving more motion segments, and reducing blood loss and operative time."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Prospective randomized study. OBJECTIVES.: To compare the results of the combined anterior-posterior surgery (Group A) with posterior ""short-segment"" transpedicular fixation (SSTF) (Group B) in mid-lumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
There are no comparative randomized clinical studies on the outcome following operative treatment of mid-lumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Forty consecutive patients with L2-L4 fresh single A3-type/AO burst fractures and load sharing score up to 6 were randomly selected to underwent either combined one-stage anterior stabilization with mesh cage and SSTF (Group A) or solely SSTF with intermediate screws in the fractured vertebra (Group B). Kyphotic Gardner angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height (PVBHr, AVBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), SF-36, VAS, and Frankel classification were used.
Results: 
The follow-up observation averaged 46 and 48 months for Group A and B, respectively. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were significant more in Group A. More surgical complications were observed in the Group A. After surgery, VAS was reduced to 4.3 and 3.6 for Group A and Group B, respectively. The SF-36 domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in Group B (P = 0.05) and (P = 0.06), respectively. Correction of AVBHr, PVBHr, and spinal canal clearance was similar in both groups. Spinal canal clearance did not differ between the two groups, but it was continuous until the last evaluation in Group B. The final Gardner angle loss of correction averaged 2 degrees and 5 degrees for Group A and Group B, respectively. The posttraumatic Gardner deformity did not significantly improve by SSTF at the final evaluation in the spines of Group B. Gardner angle correlated significantly with SCE in Group B and Group A in all three periods and in the last evaluation, respectively. Frankel grade did not correlate with loss of correction of AVBHr and PVBHr in Group A, while it significantly correlated with loss of PVBHr correction and SCE in the patients of Group B. There was no neurologic deterioration after surgery in any patient. VAS and SF-36 scores did not significantly correlate with the loss of kyphotic angle correction and AVBHr, PVBHr at the final observation in any patient of both groups.
Conclusions: 
SSTF offered similar significant short-term correction of posttraumatic deformities associated with mid-lumbar A3-burst fractures, but better clinical results as compared to combined surgery. However, SSTF did not significantly maintain the after surgery achieved correction of local posttraumatic kyphosis at the final evaluation.

A prospective randomized study was conducted to determine whether there exist any differences in radiographic, clinical, or functional outcomes when individuals with stable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction without neurologic deficit are treated with either a posterior fusion with instrumentation or anterior reconstruction, fusion, and instrumentation. There exists relatively little literature evaluating the outcomes of individuals treated with anterior surgery, and no prospective randomized studies exist comparing the two treatment approaches.
Methods: 
From May 1995 to March 2001, a consecutive series of subjects with acute isolated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) without neurologic deficit were randomized to receive either an anterior fusion with instrumentation or a posterior fusion with instrumentation. Radiographs including computed tomography (CT) were obtained. Radiographs were repeated at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months. The CT scan was also repeated at 24 months. Hospital stay, cost, operating time, blood loss, complications, and patient-related functional outcomes were measured.
Results: 
Of 43 enrolled, 38 completed a minimum of 2-year follow-up (average: 43 months; range: 24-108 months). Eighteen received a posterior spine fusion and 20 an anterior approach. Hospital stay and operating time were similar. Blood loss was higher in the group treated anteriorly; however, the incidence of transfusion was the same. There were 17 ""complications"" including instrumentation removal for pain in 18 patients treated posteriorly, but only 3 minor complications in 3 patients treated anteriorly. Patient-related functional outcomes were similar for the two groups.
Conclusions: 
Although patient outcomes are similar, anterior fusion and instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures may present fewer complications or additional surgeries."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To our knowledge, a prospective, randomized study comparing operative and nonoperative treatment of a thoracolumbar burst fracture in patients without a neurological deficit has never been performed. Our hypothesis was that operative treatment would lead to superior long-term clinical outcomes.
Methods: 
From 1994 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients (thirty-two men and fifteen women) with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative (posterior or anterior arthrodesis and instrumentation) or nonoperative treatment (application of a body cast or orthosis). Radiographs and computed tomography scans were analyzed for sagittal alignment and canal compromise. All patients completed a questionnaire to assess any disability they may have had before the injury, and they indicated the degree of pain at the time of presentation with use of a visual analog scale. The average duration of follow-up was forty-four months (minimum, twenty-four months). After treatment, patients indicated the degree of pain with use of the visual analog scale and they completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry back-pain questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey.
Results: 
In the operative group (twenty-four patients), the average fracture kyphosis was 10.1 degrees at the time of admission and 13 degrees at the final follow-up evaluation. The average canal compromise was 39% on admission, and it improved to 22% at the final follow-up examination. In the nonoperative group (twenty-three patients), the average kyphosis was 11.3 degrees at the time of admission and 13.8 degrees at the final follow-up examination after treatment. The average canal compromise was 34% at the time of admission and improved to 19% at the final follow-up examination. On the basis of the numbers available, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to return to work. The average pain scores at the time of the latest follow-up were similar for both groups. The preinjury scores were similar for both groups; however, at the time of the final follow-up, those who were treated nonoperatively reported less disability. Final scores on the SF-36 and Oswestry questionnaires were similar for the two groups, although certain trends favored those treated without surgery. Complications were more frequent in the operative group.
Conclusion: 
We found that operative treatment of patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and normal findings on the neurological examination provided no major long-term advantage compared with nonoperative treatment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Patients were alternately treated by posterior distraction using pedicle instrumentation (AO fixateur interne) or anterior decompression and instrumentation (Kostuik-Harrington device). Forty patients are presented with a mean follow-up of 20 months. Preoperatively, there was significant canal compromise in 39 patients. This measured 44.5% in those patients undergoing posterior surgery and 58% in those patients undergoing anterior surgery. Postoperatively, this was reduced to 16.5% and 4%, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference between these two groups (P less than 0.0001). The mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 18.7 degrees in those patients treated by anterior surgery and 18.2 degrees in the group treated by posterior surgery. At last follow-up, the mean improvement in kyphotic deformity was 9.3 degrees in the anterior group and 11.3 degrees in the posterior group. There is no statistically significant difference between these two groups. There were two implant failures of the anterior Kostuik-Harrington construct and two implant failures of the AO fixateur interne. Blood loss was significantly higher in the patients undergoing anterior surgery, but there were no complications from thoracotomy and anterior decompression of the dural sac.

The main aims of managing thoracolumbar fractures involve stabilization of traumatized regions, to promote vertebral healing or segmental fusion. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation has evolved as an alternative approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, aiming to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare outcomes of percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Relevant articles were identified from six electronic databases from their inception to December 2014.
Results: 
From 12 relevant studies identified, 279 patients undergoing percutaneous fixation were compared with 340 open fixation procedures. Operative duration was significantly shorter in the percutaneous group by 19 min (P = 0.0002). The percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter hospital stay by 5.7 days (P = 0.0007). Whilst there was no difference in screw malpositioning (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33, 1.83; P = 0.56), the percutaneous approach had lower rates of infections (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13, 1.00; P = 0.05), and superior visual analogue scale clinical outcomes (P = 0.001). No difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative Cobb angle (P = 0.22), postoperative body angle (P = 0.66), and postoperative anterior body height (P = 0.19).
Conclusions: 
The percutaneous approach was associated with shorter operative duration and hospital stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss and reduced infection rates.

Spine fractures are common. The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial but surgery involving pedicle screw fixation has become a popular option.
Objectives: 
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of pedicle screw fixation for traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 11), the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM Database) (1978 to March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (March 2011), reference lists of articles and conference proceedings.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing pedicle screw fixation and other methods of surgical treatment, or different methods of pedicle screw fixation, for treating traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Data collection and analysis: 
Three review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Limited meta-analysis was performed.
Main results: 
Pedicle screw fixation versus other methods of surgery that do not involve pedicle screw fixation was not looked at in any of the identified trials. Studies that were identified investigated different methods of pedicle fixation.Five randomised and three quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. All were at high or unclear risk of various biases, including selection, performance and detection bias. A total of 448 patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures were included in the review. Participants were restricted to individuals without neurological impairment in five trials. The mean ages of study populations of the eight trials ranged from 33 to 41 years, and participants had generally experienced traumatic injury. Mean follow-up for trial participants in the eight trials ranged from 28 to 72 months.Five comparisons were tested.Two trials compared short-segment instrumentation versus long-segment instrumentation. These studies found no significant differences between the two groups in self-reported function and quality of life at final follow-up. Aside from one participant, who sustained partial neurological deterioration that was resolved by further surgery (group not known), no neurological deterioration was noted in these trials.One trial comparing short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular bone grafting versus short-segment fixation alone found no significant difference between the two groups related to patient-perceived function and pain at final follow-up. All participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.Two trials compared posterior instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation ('including' group) versus posterior instrumentation alone ('bridging' group). Investigators reported no differences between the two groups in patient-reported function, quality of life, or pain at final follow-up. One trial confirmed that all participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.One trial comparing monosegmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation found no significant differences between the two groups in Oswestry Disability Index results or in pain scores at final follow-up. No neurological deterioration was reported.Three trials compared posterior instrumentation with fusion versus posterior instrumentation without fusion. Researchers found no differences between the two groups in function and quality of life or pain. No participants showed a decline in neurological status in any of the three trials, and no significant difference was reported between groups in the numbers whose status had improved at final follow-up. Two trials stated that patients in the fusion group frequently had donor site pain. Other reported complications included deep vein thrombosis and superficial infection.
Authors' conclusions: 
This review included only eight small trials and five different comparisons of methods of pedicle fixation in various participants while looking at a variety of outcomes at different time points. Overall, evidence is insufficient to inform the selection of different methods of pedicle screw fixation or the combined use of fusion. However, in the absence of robust evidence to support fusion, it is important to factor the risk of long-term donor site pain related to bone harvesting into the decision of whether to use this intervention. Further research involving high-quality randomised trials is needed."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Since introduction of the pedicle screw-rod system, short-segment pedicle screw fixation has been widely adopted for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF). Recently, the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been introduced in spinal surgery; and it has become a popularly used method for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease. However, there are few clinical reports concerning the efficacy of PPSF without fusion in treatment of TLBF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of short-segment PPSF without fusion in comparison to open short-segment pedicle screw fixation with bony fusion in treatment of TLBF.
Methods: 
This study included 59 patients, who underwent either percutaneous (n = 32) or open (n = 27) short-segment pedicle screw fixation for stabilization of TLBF between December 2003 and October 2009. Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were assessed on a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph. For patient's pain and functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Frankel grading system, and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) were measured. Operation time, and the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss were also evaluated.
Findings: 
In both groups, regional kyphosis (Cobb angle) showed significant improvement immediately after surgery, which was maintained until the last follow up, compared with preoperative regional kyphosis. Postoperative correction loss showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. In the percutaneous surgery group, there were significant declines of intraoperative blood loss, and operation time compared with the open surgery group. Clinical results showed that the percutaneous surgery group had a lower VAS score and a better LBOS at three months and six months after surgery; however, the outcomes were similar in the last follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Both open and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation were safe and effective for treatment of TLBF. Although both groups showed favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes at the final follow-up, PPSF without bone graft provided earlier pain relief and functional improvement, compared with open TPSF with posterolateral bony fusion. Despite several shortcomings in this study, the result suggests that ongoing use of PPSF is recommended for the treatment of TLBF."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ?"

To compare the clinical results between computer assisted minimally invasive spine surgery (CAMISS) and traditional open fixation surgery which used in thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients who had undergone surgery for thoracolumbar fracture from January 2006 to March 2011 was performed. The patients were randomly divided into CAMISS group and traditional open treatment group (control group) by random number table. Clinical results were assessed by comparing the following parameters between patients who had undergone CAMISS or traditional open surgery: operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) of the low back pain, the accuracy of pedicle screw, the status and the correction of kyphosis.
Results: 
Forty-seven patients underwent CAMISS, and fifty patients underwent traditional open surgery. The follow-up periods were 3 - 50 months (mean 12 months). According to the preoperative data, the two groups did not differ with respect to age, gender, marriage, occupation, mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, preoperative VAS scores of the low back pain, preoperative functional spine unit (FSU) Cobb's angle and preoperative local angle of the fracture vertebral body (P > 0.05). Compare to the control group, the patients who got CAMISS had more accuracy of pedicle screw, less blood loss, short immobilized time, lower postoperative fever, and better VAS score of the low back pain (t = 2.162 - 8.736, P < 0.05). The improvement of FSU Cobb's angle and local angle of the fracture vertebral body were better at control group after operation (13.8° ± 6.8° vs. 10.9° ± 5.5°, 11.0° ± 6.0° vs. 7.7° ± 4.8°, t = 2.108 and 2.610, P < 0.05). But there was no significant difference of the FSU Cobb's angle, or local angle of the fracture vertebral body between the two groups at post-operation and follow-up (P > 0.05).

To critically review and summarize the literature comparing the results of surgery via an anterior approach and that via a posterior approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures to identify the better approach.
Methods: 
In this meta-analysis, we conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and other databases using the search terms ""thoracolumbar fractures"", ""anterior"", ""posterior"", ""controlled clinical trials"". Relevant journals or conference proceedings were also searched manually. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the trials that met the selection criteria. Sensitivity analysis was performed when there was significant heterogeneity. Results were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95 % confidence interval.
Results: 
Four randomized clinical trials and three controlled clinical trials comparing the results of the anterior versus posterior approach in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrieved; these studies included 179 and 152 patients in the anterior and posterior approach groups, respectively. There were no differences in terms of neurological recovery, return to work, complications and Cobb angle between the two groups. The anterior approach was associated with longer operative time, greater blood loss and higher cost than the posterior approach.
Conclusions: 
The posterior approach may be more effective than the anterior approach. However, more high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to compare these approaches and guide clinical decision-making. Level of Evidence Level II, therapeutic study.

The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding the classification systems and surgical management of thoracolumbar spine trauma.
Methods: 
A Pubmed search of ""thoracolumbar"", ""spine"", ""fracture"" was used on January 05, 2013. Exclusionary criteria included non-Human studies, case reports, and non-clinical papers. RESULTS. One thousand five hundred twenty manuscripts were initially returned for the combined search string; 150 were carefully reviewed, and 48 manuscripts were included in the review.
Discussion: 
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a high prevalence in North America. The thoracolumbar junction is a point of high kinetic energy transfer and often results in thoracolumbar fractures. New classification systems for thoracolumbar spine fractures are being developed in an attempt to standardize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as well as reporting in the literature. Earlier classifications such as the Denis ""3-column model"" emphasized anatomic divisions to guide surgical planning. More modern classification systems such as the Thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) emphasize initial neurologic status and structural integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex as a guide for surgical decision making and have demonstrated a high intra- and interobserver reliability. Other systems such as the Load-Sharing Classification aid as a useful tool in planning the extent of instrumentation and fusion.
Conclusion: 
There is still much controversy over the surgical management of various thoracolumbar fractures. Level I data exists supporting the nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic compromise. However, for the majority of fracture types in this region, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish standards of care."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To evaluate the clinical and radiological efficacy of paraspinal muscle approach with winglike working channel in the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fracture.
Methods: 
From October 2010 to August 2012, a total of 51 patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures without neurological symptoms were enrolled in the study, including 32 males and 19 females. All patients were divided into two groups: 26 patients were treated through posterior paraspinal muscle approach with winglike working channel, and 25 patients were treated through traditional posterior approach. In all patients, the interval between injury and operation was less than two weeks; the vertebral canal blocked area was less than 1/3 in sagittal diameter; the compression of the fractured vertebra height was less than 2/3. And the patients with pathological fracture and severe osteoporosis were excluded. The perioperative index including operative blood loss, draining loss, operative time, postoperative bed time were recorded. The clinical results were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain preoperatively, at 3 days, 3 months, the last follow-up postoperatively and modified Macnab criteria at the last follow-up. The radiological results were evaluated by sagittal Cobb angle and the anterior height of the fractured vertebra. The data of two groups were compared statistically with paired and independent t test, χ² test, Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test.
Results: 
All patients were followed up with average of 16.6 months. In the two groups, the operative blood loss was respectively (91.5 ± 36.6) ml and (209.2 ± 38.3) ml (t=-11.216, P=0.000), draining loss was (13.7±4.4) ml and (162.3 ± 56.6) ml (t=-13.352, P=0.000), postoperative bed time was (87.3 ± 11.5) hours and (118.4 ± 20.4) hours (t=-6.727, P=0.000), VAS for back pain at 3 days postoperatively was 5.5 ± 1.0 and 6.4 ± 0.8 (t=-3.304, P=0.002), also VAS at the last follow-up was 1.0 (1.0) and 2.0 (1.0) (U=191.0, P=0.008). Data above showed significant differences between the two groups.No significant differences were found in operative time, (109.0 ± 29.7) min vs. (119.2 ± 26.8) min (t=-1.283, P=0.206), and modified Macnab criteria (χ²=0.513, P=0.774) between the two groups. The anterior height of the fractured vertebra preoperatively, at 1 week and the last follow-up postoperatively of the two groups were respectively (57.2 ± 11.8)% and (55.2 ± 10.9)% (t=0.685, P=0.496), (95.2 ± 8.3)% and (95.3 ± 5.8%) (t=-0.068, P=0.946), (92.9 ± 6.7)% and (92.1 ± 5.6)% (t=0.505, P=0.615). The sagittal Cobb angles preoperatively, at 1 week and the last follow-up postoperatively of the two groups were respectively 21.0° (12.5°) and 23.0° (12.0°) (U=316.0, P=0.544), 3.0° (5.5°) and 4.0° (4.5°) (U=342.5, P=0.893), 4.0° (5.5°) and 6.0° (6.0°) (U=328.5, P=0.701).

Operative treatment of vertebral fractures is focused on stabilization of the spine and decompression of the spinal cord and nerves. In German-speaking countries, it is common to restore the sagittal profile by fracture reduction. The use of percutaneous systems has been limited due to inferior reduction possibilities compared to open systems. The improved reduction options offered by newer percutaneous systems extend their application to highly deformed fractures.
Indications: 
Unstable thoracic, lumbar and lumbosacral spine fractures; unacceptable spinal deformities.
Contraindications: 
Need for open decompression or cross-bracing; relative contraindication: obesity or cachexia.
Surgical technique: 
3 cm skin incision 1.5 cm lateral to the radiological border of the pedicle. Incision of the fascia and blunt preparation to the facet joints. Guidewire placement via fluoroscopy. Tapping and cannulated screw setting. Insertion of the longitudinal rods and reduction using special reduction tools. Rod fixation with locking caps, wound closure, dressing.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the fractured vertebra in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Thirty-two consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. All patients received percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, and they were randomly divided into two groups to undergo either the placement of pedicle screws into the fractured vertebra (fractured group) or not (control group). The operation time and intra-operative blood loss were recorded. Oswestry disability index (ODI) questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) as clinical assessments were quantified. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), and Cobb angle (CA).
Results: 
No significant difference was observed in the operation time and intra-operative blood loss between the two groups. Clinical results (VAS and ODI scores) showed no significant difference during all the follow-up periods. In the fractured group, there were better correction and less loss of AVBH and VBI compared with the control group. However, post-operative correction of the CA immediately after surgery and the correction loss at the final follow-up showed no significant difference between the two groups.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of three different surgical procedures in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Between September 2012 and January 2015, a total of 90 patients with type A thoracolumbar fractures were randomly assigned into three groups of 30 each. Patients in group A, B, and C were treated with three-level percutaneous fixation, two-level percutaneous fixation, and three-level open fixation, respectively. Blood loss, duration of surgery, VAS scores, Cobb angles, and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were collected for statistical analysis.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 17.7 months. Post-operative Cobb angles were significantly corrected and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were well restored in all three groups (p < 0.01). Back pain was efficiently relieved according to VAS score change (p < 0.01). There were significant differences in values of blood loss and post-operative VAS scores (at three months) between group A and group C (p < 0.01). No significant difference concerning post-operative anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae, Cobb angles and correction losses was observed between group A and group B (p = 0.580, 0.840, 0.215, respectively).
Conclusion: 
Percutaneous fixation not only provides the same reduction effect as open fixation, but also has an advantage of causing less operation related trauma which is beneficial to post-operative rehabilitation. The efficacy of three-level percutaneous fixation and two-level percutaneous fixation in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures is not significantly different."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To compare the clinical effect of thoracolumbar fractures between single-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the gap of paravertebral muscles and double-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the stripping of paravertebral muscles.
Methods: 
From September 2008 to January 2010, 65 patients with incomplete compressed thoracolumbar fractures or burst thoracolumbar fractures with unilateral endplate injury were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty patients were treated with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paravertebral muscles (treatment group). Thirty-five patients were treated with double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of the paravertebral muscles (control group). All the internal fixations were taken out during 10-12 months after operation. Operative time, perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume were compared between two groups. At final follow-up, the change of neurological ASIA grade were recorded; and postoperative 5 days and final follow-up, compared Denis classification of lumbar and back pain between two groups; and analyzed the sagittal index and compressibility of anterior border of vertebral body by X -ray lateral projection.
Results: 
All patients were follow-up from 14 to 22 months with an average of 18.3 months. No postoperative infection, secondary spinal cord injury was found. One case of control group occurred internal fixation breakage at the 11th month after operation and other internal fixation no loosening. There was no significant difference in operative time, the recovery of neurological function between the two groups (P > 0.05). Perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume of treatment group was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). And in Denis classification of lumbar and back pain, the treatment group recovered more quickly, and the residual pain of lumbar and back was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). Postoperative posterior salient and compression of anterior border of vertebral body improved in two groups (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in degree of improvement between two groups (P > 0.05); but both loss existed at final follow-up (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in loss of posterior salient between two groups (P > 0.05). In the treatment group, the loss of rectify of anterior border of vertebral body existed, but it was less than that of the control group.
Conclusion: 
In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications, the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paraspinal muscles, can effectively recover the height of vertebral body and rectify posterior salient, and reduce the fixed segment. Compared with the traditional operative method of double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of paraspinal muscle, it can obviously reduce the operation wound and the bleeding, lessen the pain of lumbar and back.

The management of amyelic thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). Twenty-three patients were treated with PKP, and 25 patients with SSPI. They all presented with Type A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at two years follow-up. Radiographic data including the anterior and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle, as well as spinal canal compromise was also evaluated. The patients in both groups were similar regarding age, bone mineral density (BMD), follow-up period, severity of the deformity and fracture. Blood loss, operation time, and bed-rest time were less in the PKP group. VAS, ODI score improved more rapidly after surgery in the PKP group. No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at final follow-up (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha), the height of posterior vertebrae (Hp) and the kyphosis angle showed significant improvement in each group (p < 0.05). The postoperative improvement in spinal canal compromise was not statistically significant in the PKP group (p > 0.05); there was a significant improvement in the SSPI group (p < 0.05). Moreover, these postoperative radiographic assessments showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the improvement of canal compromise (p < 0.05). At final follow-up, remodeling of spinal canal compromise was detected in both groups.
Conclusion: 
Both PKP and SSPI appeared as effective and reliable operative techniques for selected amyelic thoracolumbar fractures in the short-term. PKP had a significantly smaller blood loss and shorter bed-rest time, but SSPI provided a better reduction.

Some studies have reported that the conventional intersegmental pedicle screws (4-screw fixation [4S]) device for thoracolumbar fractures was associated with inadequate reduction of fractured vertebrae, insufficient correction of kyphosis, and implant failure. Recently, a series of biomechanical studies has confirmed that the addition of intermediate fixation screws (6-screw fixation [6S]) could provide stronger fixation and better reduction of fractured vertebrae. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiologic efficacy of the additional intermediate screws remains unclear.
Methods: 
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was used to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes and complications of posterior pedicle screws combined with intermediate screws fixation versus conventional intersegmental pedicle screw fixation. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE, OVID, and Springer according to a search strategy, selecting articles based on inclusion criteria, and extracted data from these reports. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed. Pooled estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: 
Six randomized controlled trials involving 310 patients were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed statistically similar baseline characteristics, hospital stays, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and infection rates between the 4S group and the 6S group. The 6S group had significantly less correction loss of segmental angle and of anterior vertebral height compression, and lower implant failure rate. The 6S group also showed a slightly longer operative time and more blood loss than did the 4S group.
Conclusions: 
Based on our analysis, the combined intermediate screws fixation technique was associated with significantly improved radiologic outcomes but did not seem to compromise other perioperative outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To investigate the effect of fusion on short segment including fractured level (SSIFL) and long segment (LS) transpedicular fixation after acute thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. The 2-year clinical and radiologic follow-up results of the 2 groups also were compared.
Methods: 
Seventy-four patients were randomized into one of 2 groups: SSIFL (n = 39) or LS (n = 35). The SSIFL group included one level above and one level below, including the fracture level, whereas the LS group included 2 levels above and 2 levels below, excluding the fracture level, for the transpedicular fixation.

The clinical scores and radiologic parameters of patients with and without fusion also were compared.
Results: 
The number of patients with fusion was significantly greater in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group. There was a significant reduction of the clinical scores of patients who had fusion compared with the fusion-free group; however, there was no radiologically significant difference.

Controversy regarding the best treatment for this condition remains. The traditional surgical approach, when indicated, involves spinal fixation and arthrodesis. Newer studies have brought the need for fusion associated with internal fixation into question. Not performing arthrodesis could reduce surgical time and intraoperative bleeding without affecting clinical and radiological outcomes. With this study, the authors aimed to assess the effect of fusion, adjuvant to internal fixation, on surgically treated thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS A search of the Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed to identify randomized trials that compared the use and nonuse of arthrodesis in association with internal fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The search encompassed all data in these databases up to February 28, 2016. RESULTS Five randomized/quasi-randomized trials, which involved a total of 220 patients and an average follow-up time of 69.1 months, were included in this review. No significant difference between groups in the final scores of the visual analog pain scale or Low Back Outcome Scale was detected. Surgical time and blood loss were significantly lower in the group of patients who did not undergo fusion (p < 0.05). Among the evaluated radiological outcomes, greater mobility in the affected segment was found in the group of those who did not undergo fusion. No significant difference between groups in the degree of kyphosis correction, loss of kyphosis correction, or final angle of kyphosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS The data reviewed in this study suggest that the use of arthrodesis did not improve clinical outcomes, but it was associated with increased surgical time and higher intraoperative bleeding and did not promote significant improvement in radiological parameters."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Thoracolumbar burst fractures (TBFs) are often followed by bilateral pedicle screw fixation (BPSF) at the level of fracture using posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). There has been increasing support for unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) in an attempt to reduce complications and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic results of UPSF versus BPSF at the level of fracture using SSPI in the treatment of severe TBFs.
Methods: 
The records of 42 consecutive patients with severe TBFs who underwent SSPI were divided into 2 groups according to the number of screws in the fracture level, including 20 patients (five screws) in UPSF group and 22 patients (six screws) in BPSF. Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded before surgery, after surgery, and 1.5 years after operation. The patients'clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). For radiological evaluation, changes in local kyphosis angle (LKA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH) were investigated using plain radiographs.

Radiologically, no statistically difference was observed between the two groups in corrected rate of LKA, VWA, or AVH(all P > 0.05). With respect to clinical variants including VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the UPSF group seemed to have advantages over BPSF group in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, hospitalization time (P > 0.05). Especially, implant cost for the BPSF group was 22% greater than the UPSF group. No serious complications occurred in our study. In all cases, fusions healed well and no revision surgery was performed for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation during follow-up.
Conclusions: 
The present study is the first to demonstrate that patients undergoing SSPI with UPSF as compared with BPSF for the treatment of severe TBFs had similar clinical and radiologic outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ?"

The surgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures frequently involves posterior pedicle screw fixation. However, the application of short- or long-segment instrumentation is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of the short-segment fixation with inclusion of the fracture level (SSFIFL) versus the traditional long-segment fixation (LSF) for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures.
Methods: 
From December 2009 to February 2014, 60 patients with unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures (T11-L2) were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group 1 included 30 patients treated by SSFIFL (six-screw construct including the fracture level). Group 2 included 30 patients treated by LSF (eight-screw construct excluding the fracture level). Local kyphosis angle (LKA), anterior body height (ABH), posterior body height (PBH), ABH/PBH ratio of fractured vertebra, and Asia Scale Impairment Scale were evaluated.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in regard to age, sex, trauma etiology, fracture level, fracture type, neurologic status, pre-operative LKA, ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio and follow-up (p > 0.05). Reduction of post-traumatic kyphosis (assessed with LKA) and restoration of fracture-induced wedge shape of the vertebral body (assessed with ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio) at post-operative period were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.234; p = 0.754). There was no significant difference between the two groups in term of correction loss at the last follow-up too (LKA was 15.97° ± 5.62° for SSFIFL and 17.76° ± 11.22° for LSF [p = 0.427]). Neurological outcome was similar in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Inclusion of fracture level in a short-segment fixation for a thoracolumbar junction fractures results in a kyphosis correction and in a maintenance of the sagittal alignment similar to a long-segment instrumentation. Finally, this technique allowed us to save two or more segments of vertebral motion."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ?"

To evaluate and compare the long-term outcome of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated using anterior, posterior or combined anterior and posterior approaches.
Methods: 
The prospective randomised controlled study was conducted at the Tianjin 4th Centre Hospital, Tianjin, China, and comprised patients of unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture operated between July 2004 and July 2006 and followed up for five years. The patients were divided randomly into three groups of anterior, posterior and combined anterior and posterior approaches. Clinical data was analysed using SPSS 17.
Results: 
Of the 66 cases in the study, 45 (68.18%) were male and 21 (31.8%) were female, with overall age ranging from 19 to 69 years. There were 22 (33.3%) patients in the anterior group, 23 (35%) in the posterior group, and 21 (32%) in the combined anterior and posterior group. Comparison was made between two respective groups. The combined group was found to have the longest operation time (p < 0.02; p < 0.01, respectively), larger blood loss (p < 0.006; p < 0.005, respectively), longer hospital stay (p < 0.01; p < 0.003, respectively) and higher hospitalisation costs (p < 0.004; p < 0.001, respectively). The postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly smaller than preoperative one in all groups (p < 0.01; p < 0.02; p < 0.01).

Short-segment U-shaped pedicle screw fixation has been widely used to treat thoracolumbar burst fracture. Some studies have reported the disadvantages of traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, which included a relatively high rate of adjacent segment degeneration and screw failure, including screw pullout and breakage. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of open reduction and fixation using KumaFix fixation system in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
From June 2011 to June 2012, 45 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with KumaFix (the treatment group, n = 23) or traditional U-shaped pedicle screw (the control group, n = 22). The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiologic and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb angle and vertebral wedge angle. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Questionnaire.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 9 to 22 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The operation time in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Preoperative Cobb angles and vertebral wedge angles in two groups were significantly decreased after surgery, and these have been well maintained at the last follow-up with mild correction losses. The results of clinical outcome showed lower VAS and ODI scores in two groups compared with those preoperative, and the treatment group had greater improvement on the ODI compared with the control group at the last follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Compared with traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, KumaFix fixation system can achieve gradual, controlled reduction, provide enough space for bone implantation, and avoid acceleration of adjacent segment degeneration. It is an effective and reliable technique to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Специальные методы"

The main aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after stabilization by a percutaneous transpedicular system and stabilization from the standard open approach for thoracolumbar spine injury.
Methods: 
Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in the study over a period of 16 months. Patients were included in the study if they experienced 1 thoracolumbar fracture (A3.1-A3.3, according to the AO/Magerl classification), had an absence of neurological deficits, had no other significant injuries, and were willing to participate. Eighteen patients were treated by short-segment, minimally invasive, percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. The control group was composed of 19 patients who were stabilized using a short-segment transpedicular construct, which was performed through a standard midline incision. The pain profile was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS), and overall satisfaction by a simple 4-stage scale relating to performance of daily activities. Working ability and return to original occupation were also monitored. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), vertebral body angle (VBA), and bisegmental Cobb angle. The accuracy of screw placement was examined using CT.
Results: 
The mean surgical duration in the percutaneous screw group was 53 ± 10 minutes, compared with 60 ± 9 minutes in the control group (p = 0.032). The percutaneous screw group had a significantly lower perioperative blood loss of 56 ± 17 ml, compared with 331 ± 149 ml in the control group (p < 0.001). Scores on the VAS in patients in the percutaneous screw group during the first 7 postoperative days were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in VBI, VBA, and Cobb angle values during follow-up. There was no significant difference in screw placement accuracy between the groups and no patients required surgical revision. There was no significant difference between groups in overall satisfaction at the 2-year follow-up (p = 0.402). Working ability was insignificantly better in the percutaneous screw group; previous working position was achieved in 17 patients in this group and in 12 cases in the control group (p = 0.088).
Conclusions: 
This study confirms that the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique represents a viable option in the treatment of preselected thoracolumbar fractures. A significant reduction in blood loss, postoperative pain, and surgical time were the main advantages associated with this minimally invasive technique. Clinical, functional, and radiological results were at least the same as those achieved using the open technique after a 2-year follow-up. The short-term benefits of the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique are apparent, and long-term results have to be studied in other well-designed studies evaluating the theoretical benefit of the percutaneous technique and assessing whether the results of the latter are as durable as the ones achieved by open surgery."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To evaluate the efficacies of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra plus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Between June 2008 and September 2010, a total of 46 patients with fractures of thoracolumbar junction, whose scores of load sharing classification (LSC) ranging from 5 to 7, underwent the combined treatment of SSPI and fracture level pedicle screw at our department. They were divided into 2 groups. Group I included 25 patients undergoing SSPI plus unilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (5 screws) while Group II included 21 patients had SSPI plus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (6 screws). The data of anterior body height compression (AVHC), sagittal Cobb's angle, internal fixation failure, restoration of nervous function, visual analogue score (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were analyzed.
Results: 
The groups were similar with regards to age, gender, LSC, AVHC and sagittal Cobb's angle preoperatively. Blood loss volume and operative duration were less in the Group I (109.2 ± 30.68 vs 110.0 ± 32.06 min, t = -0.086, P > 0.05 and 376.0 ± 303.1 vs 409.5 ± 361.1 ml, t = -0.342, P > 0.05).

To investigate the clinical outcome of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws through paraspinal muscle sparing approach to treat thoracolumbar fractures, and to discuss its advantages.
Methods: 
From August 2010 to June 2012, we had 40 thoracolumber fractures patients (27 males and 13 females). Their ages ranged from 22 to 60 years. Of the 40 cases, 4 were T11 fractures, 13 T12 fractures ,17 L1 fractures,6 L2 fractures. According to Denis classification,all of them were burst fractures, with vertebral canal compromise less than 1/3. According to AO classification they were type A or type B1 injuries. All the cases had no nerve injury. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. With Group A (20 cases) we took the method of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to fix one level above and below the injured vertebra through the parespinal muscle sparing approach. With Group B (20 cases), we took the traditional posterior midline approach and open procedure. Then we compared the two groups by operation time, blood loss, drainage, Visual Analogue Scales and X-ray exposure.
Results: 
Minimal invasive group had obvious advatages in operation time, bleeding control and early pain relief of post-operation. The X-ray exposure and long-term follow-up outcome were almost the same.

Flexion-distraction injuries occur due to distractive forces causing disruption of the posterior and middle spinal columns. These fractures classically consist of a fracture line through the posterior bony elements; involvement of the posterior ligamentous complex is, however, common. Surgical treatment is often required for these unstable injuries to avoid neurological deterioration and posttraumatic kyphosis, and the surgery traditionally consists of an open posterior approach with instrumented fusion. Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for these injuries, with the goal of minimal tissue disruption and preservation of normal anatomy while achieving adequate stabilization, has recently been reported in the literature, but to date, a direct comparative study comparing open and percutaneous fixation has not been reported. The authors report their experience treating these fractures with both techniques and review the available literature.
Methods: 
Patients with flexion-distraction injury who were treated between May 2003 and March 2013 were prospectively followed. American Spinal Injury Association scores and degree of kyphotic angulation were recorded at admission, discharge, and follow-up. Data regarding intraoperative blood loss and operative time were obtained from a chart review. Patients treated with open versus minimally invasive procedures were compared.
Results: 
The authors identified 39 patients who suffered flexion-distraction injuries and were treated at their institution during the specified period; one of these patients declined surgery. All had injury to the posterior ligamentous complex. Open surgical procedures with pedicle screw fixation and posterolateral fusion were performed in 27 patients, while 11 patients underwent minimally invasive pedicle screw placement. Overall, there was improvement in kyphotic angulation at the time of discharge as well as most recent follow-up in both the open surgery and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) groups. The authors found no significant difference in American Spinal Injury Association score or the degree of kyphotic angulation between the MIS and open surgery groups. There was a trend toward shorter operative time for the MIS group, and patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures had significantly less blood loss.
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screw fixation appears to have similar efficacy in the treatment of flexion-distraction injuries and it allows for reduced blood loss and tissue damage compared with open surgical techniques. Therefore it should be considered as an option for the treatment of this type of injury."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006.
Objectives: 
To compare the outcomes of surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done.
Main results: 
We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.
Authors' conclusions: 
The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. It is likely, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The optimal timing of stabilization in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. There is currently a lack of consensus on the timing of surgical stabilization, which is limited by the reality that a randomized controlled trial to evaluate early versus late stabilization is difficult to perform. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the benefits, safety and costs of early stabilization compared with late stabilization using data available in the current literature.
Methods: 
An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies evaluating the timing of surgery in patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Two reviewers independently analyzed and selected each study on the basis of the eligibility criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (GRADE). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
Ten studies involving 2,512 subjects were identified. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization shortened the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days and reduced morbidity and hospital expenses for patients with thoracic fractures. However, reduced morbidity and hospital expenses were not observed with stabilization of lumbar fractures. Owing to the very low level of evidence, no conclusion could be made regarding the effect of early stabilization on mortality.
Conclusions: 
We could adhere to the recommendation that patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures should undergo early stabilization, which may reduce the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, morbidity and hospital expenses, particularly when the thoracic spine is involved. Individual patient characteristics should be concerned carefully. However, the definite conclusion cannot be made due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and low level of evidence. Further prospective studies are required to confirm whether there are benefits to early stabilization compared with late stabilization."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The optimal treatment strategy for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction is discussed controversially in the literature. Whilst 360° fusion has shown to result in better radiological outcome, recent studies have failed to show its superiority concerning clinical outcome. The morbidity associated with the additional anterior approach may account for these findings. The aim of this prospective observational study was therefore to compare two different techniques for 360° fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures using either thoracoscopy or a transforaminal approach (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF)) to support the anterior column.
Methods: 
Posterior reduction and short-segmental fixation using angular stable pedicle screw systems were performed in all patients as a first step. Monocortical strut grafts were used for the anterior support in the TLIF group, whilst tricortical grafts or titanium vertebral body replacing implants of adjustable height were used in the combined posteroanterior group. At final follow-up, the radiological outcome was assessed by performing X-rays in a standing position. The clinical outcome was measured using five validated outcome scores. The morbidity associated with the approaches and the donor site was assessed as well.
Results: 
There were 21 patients in the TLIF group and 14 patients in the posteroanterior group included. The postoperative loss of correction was higher in the TLIF group (4.9°±8.3° versus 3.4°±6.4°, p>0.05). There were no significant differences regarding the outcome scores between the two groups. There were no differences in terms of return to employment, leisure activities and back function either. More patients suffered from donor-site morbidity in the TLIF group, whilst the morbidity associated with the surgical approach was higher in the posteroanterior group.
Conclusion: 
The smaller donor-site morbidity in the posteroanterior group is counterbalanced by an additional morbidity associated with the anterior approach resulting in similar clinical outcome. Mastering both techniques will allow the spine surgeon to be more flexible in specific situations, for example, in patients with neurological deficits or severe concomitant thoracic trauma."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

A prospective clinical trial was conducted.
Objective: 
To compare the clinical and radiologic late results of monosegmental transpedicular fixation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures and evaluate the efficacy of monosegmental transpedicular fixation.
Summary of background data: 
SSPI (1 level above and 1 below the fracture level) are accepted by many surgeons as an accepted technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. To preserve more motion segments, some authors have advocated monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI). The recent developments showed that MSPI yielded good clinical results; however, there were no report about comparison of clinical outcome between monosegmental and biosegmental transpedicular fixation in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Eighty-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were randomized by a simple method into 2 groups. Group 1 were treated with monosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 47), and group 2 were treated with biosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 38). Clinical (Low Back Outcome Score and Oswestry Disability Index) and radiologic (load-sharing classification index, sagittal index, and percentage of anterior body height compression) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The 2 groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, local kyphosis, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate between the 2 surgical approaches was also not significantly different (group 1 = 6.38% and group 2 = 5.26%). Oswestry Disability Index improved in both groups by >25 points in a similar amount (P = 0.23). The average follow-up Low Back Outcome Score was 74.9 and 60.2 for group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = 0.033).
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, radiologic parameters demonstrated that both MSPI and SSPI are the effective and reliable operative techniques for selected thoracolumbar burst fractures. MSPI shortened the operative time and decreased the amount of blood loss significantly and, thus, offered better clinical results. Nevertheless, long-term studies are supposed to be performed to support the outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The MCSII results are an update of those obtained with the first multicenter study (MCSI) more than a decade ago. The aim of the study was to assess and bring into focus: the (1) epidemiologic data, (2) surgical and radiological outcome, and (3) 2-year follow-up (FU) results of these injuries. According to the Magerl/AO classification, there were 424 (57.8%) compression fractures (A type), 178 (24.3%) distractions injuries (B type), and 131 (17.9%) rotational injuries (C type). B and C type injuries carried a higher risk for neurological deficits, concomitant injuries, and multiple vertebral fractures. The level of injury was located at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) in 67.0% of the case. 380 (51.8%) patients were operated on by posterior stabilization and instrumentation alone (POSTERIOR), 34 (4.6%) had an anterior procedure (ANTERIOR), and 319 (43.5%) patients were treated with combined posteroanterior surgery (COMBINED). 65% of patients with thoracic (T1-T10) and 57% with lumbar spinal (L3-L5) injuries were treated with a single posterior approach (POSTERIOR). 47% of the patients with thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) injuries were either operated from posterior or with a combined posterior-anterior surgery (COMBINED) each. Short angular stable implant systems have replaced conventional non-angular stable instrumentation systems to a large extent. The posttraumatic deformity was restored best with COMBINED surgery. T-spine injuries were accompanied by a higher number and more severe neurologic deficits than TL junction or L-spine injuries. At the same time T-spine injuries showed less potential for neurologic recovery especially in paraplegic (Frankel/AISA A) patients. 5% of all patients required revision surgery for perioperative complications. Follow-up data of 558 (76.1%) patients were available and collected during a 30-month period from 1 January 2004 until 31 May 2006. On average, a posterior implant removal was carried out in a total of 382 COMBINED and POSTERIOR patients 12 months after the initial surgery. On average, the rehabilitation process required 3-4 weeks of inpatient treatment, followed by another 4 months of outpatient therapy and was significantly shorter when compared with MCSI in the mid-1990s. From the time of injury until FU, 80 (60.6%) of 132 patients with initial neurological deficits improved at least one grade on the Frankel/ASIA Scale; 8 (1.3%) patients deteriorated. A higher recovery rate was observed for incomplete neurological injuries (73%) than complete neurological injuries (44%). Different surgical approaches did not have a significant influence on the neurologic recovery until FU. Nevertheless, neurological deficits are the most important factors for the functional outcome and prognosis of TL spinal injuries. POSTERIOR patients had a better functional and subjective outcome at FU than COMBINED patients. However, the posttraumatic radiological deformity was best corrected in COMBINED patients and showed significantly less residual kyphotic deformity (biseg GDW -3.8° COMBINED vs. -6.1° POSTERIOR) at FU (p = 0.005). The sagittal spinal alignment was better maintained when using vertebral body replacement implants (cages) in comparison to iliac strut grafts. Additional anterior plate systems did not have a significant influence on the radiological FU results. In conclusion, comprehensive data of a large patient population with acute thoracolumbar spinal injuries has been obtained and analyzed with this prospective internet-based multicenter study. Thus, updated results and the clinical outcome of the current operative treatment strategies in participating German and Austrian trauma centers have been presented. Nevertheless, it was not possible to answer all remaining questions to contradictory findings of the subjective, clinical outcome and corresponding radiological findings between different surgical subgroups.

Systematic Review.
Objective: 
To determine whether early spinal stabilization in thoracolumbar spine trauma decreases morbidity and mortality.
Summary of background data: 
The role of early spinal stabilization through surgical means may have a number of benefits. These include reduced morbidity and mortality because of more rapid mobilization afforded by spinal column stabilization and a reduction in the incidence and severity of sepsis and respiratory failure. There are several potential disadvantages of early surgery. The most strongly debated is the potential that the additional physiologic injury may result in an unintended increase in morbidity and mortality caused by worsening of existing injuries, such as with pulmonary or intracranial trauma. This problem may be compounded by increased hemorrhage and resulting hypotension. Operating in the presence of missed or underestimated associated injuries or under less-than-ideal conditions relative to the complexity of the surgery and resources required is also a potential disadvantage.
Methods: 
A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published between January 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify published studies examining the timing of thoracolumbar fracture fixation. Two independent reviewers assessed the strength of literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, assessing quality, quantity, and consistency of results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
A total of 68 articles were initially screened, and 9 ultimately met the predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization of thoracic fractures reduced the mean number of days on a ventilator, the number of days in intensive care unit and in hospital, and reduced respiratory morbidity compared with late stabilization. This effect, other than the length of hospital stay, was not seen with stabilization of lumbar fractures. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect of the timing of stabilization on mortality in thoracolumbar fractures.
Conclusion: 
Ideally, patients with unstable thoracic fractures should undergo early (<72 hours) stabilization of their injury to reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue.

Some studies suggested that nonfusion had several advantages over fusion. The aim of this prospective study was to compare long segment posterior instrumentation with fusion versus long-segment posterior instrumentation without fusion.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 42 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation with fusion (WF), whereas Group 2 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation without fusion (WOF). Long segment instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
Measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index and anterior vertebral height compression showed that both group had similar outcome at final follow-up. Moreover, there was no difference between the two groups according to low back outcome score. Also, implant failure rate (4.7%) was quite low in both groups. However, WF group had prolonged operative time, increased blood loss and donor site morbidity.

The ideal timing of spinal fixation is controversial. A recent study showed that early spine fixation reduced morbidity and resource utilization. We previously noted a trend toward higher mortality in patients undergoing early spinal fixation. This study was done to analyze whether the timing of spinal fixation had a significant effect on mortality.
Methods: 
The registry of our Level I trauma program was queried for all patients with at least one spinal vertebral injury. Anatomic and physiologic variables included age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Injury Severity Score. Outcome was evaluated in terms of ventilator days, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality. Patients were stratified by day of spinal operative fixation as early when done within 48 hours and late when done after 48 hours. Data were analyzed using chi and an unpaired t test, accepting p < 0.05 as significant.
Results: 
Three hundred sixty-one patients between January 1988 and February 2003 required operative spinal fixation (158 early, within 48 hours vs. 203 late, beyond 48 hours). There was no significant difference between the two groups except mortality, which was significantly higher in the early group (7.6 vs. 2.5%; p = 0.0257), and HLOS, which was significantly shorter in the early group (14.42 vs. 17.64 days; p = 0.025).
Conclusion: 
Spinal fixation within 48 hours after vertebral fractures and dislocations appears to increase mortality despite similar anatomic and physiologic parameters in the later operative group. Incomplete resuscitation of patients before surgery may have contributed to this result. The shorter HLOS may have been because of the higher number of early deaths. Prospective studies to identify the optimal timing of spinal fixation and the reason for these outcome differences are warranted."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ? | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

Patients were randomized for operative or nonsurgical treatment. Data sampling involved demographics, fracture classifications, radiographic evaluation, and functional outcome.
Results: 
Sixteen patients received nonsurgical therapy, and 18 received surgical treatment. Follow-up was completed for 32 (94%) of the patients after a mean of 4.3 years. At the end of follow-up, both local and regional kyphotic deformity was significantly less in the operatively treated group. All functional outcome scores (VAS Pain, VAS Spine Score, and RMDQ-24) showed significantly better results in the operative group. The percentage of patients returning to their original jobs was found to be significantly higher in the operative treated group.
Conclusions: 
Patients with a Type A3 thoracolumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit should be treated by short-segment posterior stabilization."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest, and immobilization with a brace once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilization of the fracture with screws, often with decompression, an operation to remove bone fragments which have intruded into the vertebral canal.
Objectives: 
To compare operative with non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Search strategy: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (May 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2005), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) available at http://cbm.imicams.ac.cn (January 1978 to April 2005). We also searched reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted authors where necessary.
Selection criteria: 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing operative with non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Pooling of data was not carried out as only one small, poor quality trial was included.
Main results: 
We included one trial comparing operative with non-operative treatment (53 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in pain and function-related outcomes, rates of return to work, radiographic findings or average length of hospitalization at final follow up. The rate of complications was higher for the patients treated operatively. The degree of kyphosis or the percentage of correction lost did not correlate with any clinical symptoms at the time of the final follow up. Average costs related to hospitalization and treatment in the operative group appeared to be more than in the non-operative group.
Authors' conclusions: 
There was no statistically significant difference on the functional outcome two years or more after therapy between operative and non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. However, this review was able to include only one randomized controlled trial with a small sample size and poor quality, which precluded firm conclusions. More research with high quality trials is needed."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Что-то не вышло"

Despite extensive published research on thoracolumbar burst fractures, controversy still surrounds which is the most appropriate treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature on operative and nonoperative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and no neurological deficit.
Methods: 
In their search of the literature, the authors identified all possible relevant studies concerning thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit. Two independent observers performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction in a blinded and objective manner for all papers identified during the search. In a synthesis of the literature, the authors obtained evidence for both operative and nonoperative treatments.
Conclusions: 
There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the superiority of one approach over the other as measured using generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life scales. There is no scientific evidence linking posttraumatic kyphosis to clinical outcomes. The authors found that there is a strong need for improved clinical research methodology to be applied to this patient population."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

A prospective clinical study.
Objective: 
To evaluate whether a percutaneous dorsal instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures prevents irreversible damage to the spinal muscles.
Methods: 
A total of 57 patients with thoracolumbar fractures (Th12-L4) were divided into two groups, comparable in terms of gender, fracture level, classification and surgical concept. In the first, 24/57 patients were treated using an open procedure (OP-G); in the second, 33/57 were treated via percutaneous dorsal instrumentation (PER-G). Fracture localisation and classification, accuracy of pedicle screw placement, perioperative blood loss, OR- and image converter time as well as muscle damage (needle-EMG) were evaluated.
Results: 
OR- and image converter time as well as the accuracy of pedicle screw placement were not statistically different between groups. The difference in perioperative blood loss [43 (10-90) ml (PER-G) vs [870 (570-1,200 ml (OP-G)] was statistically significant (P <0.005). Needle EMG revealed no muscle damage, and the physiological activity and muscle potentials were normal (PER-G). In the OP-G, polyphasic EMG signals were most common (80%), a sign of the drop-out of numerous motor units.
Conclusions: 
The open procedure caused permanent and significant damage to the strongest extensors of the autochthonus back musculature, the m. multifidus, which results from multisegment combined damage to the r. posterior nervi spinalis and muscle fibres. In contrast, percutaneous placement of an internal fixative reduces perioperative access morbidity causing little iatrogenic damage to back muscles and only a minor perioperative blood loss."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Short-segment (SS) pedicle fixation has become a popular treatment option. However, there are several studies regarding the high rate of failure. The aim of this prospective study was to compare SS versus long-segment (LS) instrumentation.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 18 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included nine patients treated by SS pedicle fixation, whereas group 2 included nine patients treated by LS instrumentation. SS instrumentation was pedicle fixation one level above and below the fractured vertebra. LS instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
As a result, measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index, and anterior vertebral height compression showed that the LS group had a better outcome at final follow-up (P < 0.05). Also, the SS group had a 55% failure rate, whereas the LS group had prolonged operative time and increased blood loss. However, there was no difference between the two groups according to Low Back Outcome Score.
Conclusions: 
In conclusion, radiographic parameters demonstrated that LS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Nevertheless, clinical outcome was the same between the two groups. However, our conclusions were based on posterior-only surgery. Anterior column support would negate the need for LS fixation. Also, SS would have been more successful if two above and two below pedicle screws were used."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

A systematic review of the literature, pertaining surgical treatment of traumatic thoracic and lumbar spine fractures, was performed.
Objectives: 
To provide information on surgical techniques for traumatic spine fracture management, their respective performance and complication rates, based on previously published information.
Summary of background data: 
The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to choose between the various surgical options. In absence of conclusive studies, a systematic review can be an alternative to obtain more convincing information.
Methods: 
Full-text papers from 1970 until 2001 were included if strict inclusion criteria were met. Five surgical subgroups were recognized: posterior short-segment (PS), posterior long-segment (PL), reports on both posterior short- and long-segment (PSL), anterior (A), and anterior combined with posterior (AP) techniques. Clearly defined and generally accepted parameters were scored and subsequently analyzed. The preoperative injury severity of the surgical groups was compared. The neurologic, radiologic, and functional outcome and complications of all groups were assessed.
Results: 
A total of 132 papers, the majority being retrospective case-series, were included representing 5,748 patients. The preoperative injury severity revealed an inequality between the subgroups. Partial neurologic deficits had the potential to resolve irrespective of treatment choice. None of the five techniques used was able to maintain the corrected kyphosis angle. The functional outcome after surgery seems to be better than generally believed. Complications are relatively rare.
Conclusions: 
In general, surgical treatment of traumatic spine fractures is safe and effective. Surgical techniques can only be compared using randomized controlled trials."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

In this article the authors investigated the consequences of misplaced thoracolumbar pedicle screws on late spinal stability.
Method: 
This study consisted of 16 patients with screws in the proper position (Group A) and a further 16 patients with screw misplacement (Group B) who had previously undergone transpedicular screw fixation following thoracolumbar injury. The authors retrospectively evaluated the bone fusion, anterior height of the fractured vertebrae and the kyphotic deformity on postoperative early neutral, and on postoperative long-term neutral and dynamic radiographs in both groups. The results and in addition a back pain questionnaire were compared within each group, and also between groups A and B.
Findings: 
The decreased anterior height of the fractured vertebrae and the increased degree of kyphosis on postoperative early radiographs in group B demonstrated that the correction of the deformity was inadequate in patients with screw misplacement. Furthermore, an additional increase in the degree of kyphosis on long-term neutral radiographs indicated a significant progression in late kyphotic deformity in group B, whereas it was not seen in group A. The evidence of significant motion on neutral-flexion and flexion-extension long-term radiographs demonstrated impaired stability in group B, whilst it was only evident in neutral-flexion radiographs in group A. Moreover, moderate to severe back pain was commonly reported by patients in group B and correlated with lack of bony fusion and significant motion.
Interpretation: 
The authors conclude that the screw misplacement decreased the original spinal stability provided by the instrumentation. Therefore, correct placement of pedicle screws is required to maintain long-term spinal stability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the effect of transpedicular intracorporeal grafting on spinal canal restoration and remodeling in a group of patients treated with short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-one patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomised into transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n=11) and non-transpedicular grafting (NTPG) (n=10) groups, and were prospectively followed for an average of 50 months (range 25-85 months). Groups were similar in age, type of fracture, load sharing classification and kyphotic deformity. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomographic (CT) images through the level of pedicles were obtained, corrected for differences in magnification, and digitized. Areas of the spinal canals were measured and normalized by the estimated area at that level (average of adjacent levels). Average kyphosis was 19.7 degrees+/-6.2 degrees at presentation, was corrected to 1.9 degrees+/-4.9 degrees by operation, but was found to have deteriorated to 9.1 degrees+/-6.4 degrees at final follow-up. There were no differences between groups regarding the evolution of sagittal deformity. Spinal canal narrowing was 38.5+/-18.2% at presentation, 22.1+/-19.8% postoperatively, and it further improved to -2.5+/-16.7% at follow-up, similar for both groups. Our results demonstrate that transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in the treatment of burst fractures does not have a detectable effect on the rate of reconstruction of the canal area or on remodeling.

A prospective, randomized study comparing two treatment methods for thoracolumbar burst fractures: short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting and the same procedure without transpedicular grafting.
Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of transpedicular grafting in preventing failure of short-segment fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Short-segment pedicle instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures is known to fail early because of the absence of anterior support. Additional transpedicular grafting has been offered as an alternative to prevent this failure. However, there is controversy about the results of transpedicular grafting.
Methods: 
Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in the study. The inclusion criterion was the presence of fractures through the T11-L3 vertebrae without neurologic compromise. The patients were randomized by a simple method into two groups. Group 1 patients were treated using short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n = 10), and Group 2 patients were treated by short-segment fixation alone (NTPG) (n = 10). Clinical (Likert's questionnaire) and radiologic (sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and local kyphosis) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in local kyphosis and/or screw breakage, was also not significantly different (TPG = 50%, NTPG = 40%, P = 0.99).
Conclusions: 
Short-segment transpedicular instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures is associated with a high rate of failure that cannot be decreased by additional transpedicular intracorporeal grafting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

The study should analyze the operative methods currently used and determine the results in a large representative collective. This investigation was realized by the working group ""spine"" of the German Trauma Society. Between September 1994 and December 1996, 682 patients treated in 18 different traumatology centers in Germany and Austria were included. Part 2 describes the details of the operative methods and measured data in standard radiographs and CT scans of the spine. Of the patients, 448 (65.7%) were treated with posterior, 197 (28.9%) with combined posterior-anterior, and 37 (5.4%) with anterior surgery alone. In 72% of the posterior operations, the instrumentation was combined with transpedicular bone grafting. The combined procedures were performed as one-stage operations in 38.1%. A significantly longer average operative time (4:14 h) was noted in combined cases compared to the posterior (P < 0.001) or anterior (P < 0.05) procedures. The average blood loss was comparable in both posterior and anterior groups. During combined surgery the blood loss was significantly higher (P < 0.001; P < 0.05). The longest intraoperative fluoroscopy time (average 4:08 min) was noticed in posterior surgery with a significant difference compared to the anterior group. In almost every case a ""Fixateur interne"" (eight different types of internal fixators) was used for posterior stabilization. For anterior instrumentation, fixed angle implants (plate or rod systems) were mainly preferred (n = 22) compared to non-fixed angle plate systems (n = 12). A decompression of the spinal canal (indirect by reduction or direct by surgical means) was performed in 70.8% of the neurologically intact patients (Frankel/ASIA E) and in 82.6% of those with neurologic deficit (Frankel/ASIA grade A-D). An intraoperative myelography was added in 22% of all patients. The authors found a significant correlation between the amount of canal compromise in preoperative CT scans and the neurologic deficit in Frankel/ASIA grades. The wedge angle and sagittal index measured on lateral radiographs improved from -17.0 degrees and 0.63 (preoperative) to -6.3 degrees and 0.86 (postoperative). A significantly (P < 0.01) stronger deformity was noted preoperatively in the combined group compared to the posterior one. The segmental kyphosis angle improved by 11.3 degrees (8.8 degrees with inclusion of the two adjacent intervertebral disc spaces). A significantly better operative correction of the kyphotic deformity was found in the combined group. In 101 (14.8%) patients, intra- or postoperative complications were noticed, 41 (6.0%) required reoperation. There was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. Of the 2264 pedicle screws, 139 (6.1%) were found to be misplaced. This number included all screws, which were judged to be not placed in an optimal direction or location. In seven (1.0%) patients the false placement of screws was judged as a complication, four (0.6%) of them required revision. The multicenter study determines the actual incidence of thoracolumbar fractures and dislocations with associated injuries and describes the current standard of operative treatment. The efforts and prospects of different surgical methods could be demonstrated considering certain related risks.

Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively. According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program. All fractures in the conservative group were of type A. At follow-up of all operated cases, the local gibbus angle had improved by a reduction of on average 18.6 degrees and was followed by a loss of correction of 12.5 degrees ending in a final gain of 6.1 degrees at follow-up. At follow-up of the conservatively treated cases, the local gibbus angle showed an improvement of 11.1 degrees at reduction and a loss of correction of 14.9 degrees after reduction. The remaining result was -3.6 degrees, that means an increase of kyphoses compared to the x-ray at admission. In order to be able to compare two homogeneous groups only fractures of type A were used. Comparison of the two groups showed an improvement of the vertebral body angle of 70% (11.3 degrees) after reduction in the surgical group and 46% (6.1 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The subsequent loss of correction was 19% (3 degrees) in the surgical and 34% (4.5 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The remaining gain at follow-up was 51% (8.3 degrees) in the surgical and only 12% (1.6 degrees) in the conservative group. The local gibbus angle had improved on average by 17.1 degrees after reduction in the surgical and by 11.1 degrees in the conservatively treated group. Loss of correction was 71% (12.2 degrees) and 132% (14.9 degrees), respectively. The final result at follow-up showed a decrease of kyphosis of 4.9 degrees in the surgical and an increase of kyphosis of 3.7 degrees in the conservatively treated group. The difference was significant. Within the surgical group, 75% of the loss of correction was caused by the discs and 25% by the vertebral body.

There was no relationship between radiological and clinical outcome. Whereas 15% of the patients of the surgical group were not satisfied or moderately satisfied with the result, all patients in the conservatively treated group were satisfied or very satisfied. Based on the good clinical results of the conservative treatment we can conclude that in stable fractures without severe deformity, and in patients who are in bad general condition, conservative treatment can considered as an alternative to surgical treatment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

A prospective, longitudinal study of multiply injured patients treated with segmental instrumentation for spinal fractures with a minimum 2-year follow-up.
Objectives: 
To determine whether urgent stabilization of spinal fractures in severely injured patients increases the risk of surgery compared with early treatment and historical results.
Summary and background data: 
Opinion in clinical studies is divided about whether operative treatment offers an advantage over nonoperative treatment in isolated spine fractures. Concomitant trauma is rarely discussed relative to decision making or surgical timing. Urgent stabilization of long-bone fractures improves survival and outcome in polytrauma patients. To date, urgent treatment of spine fractures in polytrauma patients has not been considered in the literature.
Methods: 
Seventy-five consecutive patients treated with segmental instrumentation for spinal trauma were observed prospectively to assess perioperative and longterm outcome. Twenty-seven patients with severe polytrauma (injury severity score, > 26) were separately analyzed. Perioperative and postoperative results were analyzed relative to timing of surgery, injury severity score, and surgical approach. Urgent treatment was defined as that provided within 24 hours of the spinal injury, and early treatment was defined as that provided between 24 and 72 hours after injury.
Results: 
Twenty-five patients (93%) sustained two or more major injuries in addition to the spine fracture, and 17 of 27 (63%) had neurologic injury. The mean injury severity score approached or exceeded the LD50 (50% expected mortality) in each group--36.0 for the early-treatment group and 42.0 for the urgent group--but only one patient in each group died. There were no deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, neurologic injuries, decubiti, deep wound infections, or episodes of sepsis in either group. Blood loss for anterior procedures was significantly higher in the urgent group, but estimated blood loss for posterior procedures was similar for both groups. At 49 months' mean follow-up, no revisions were necessitated by the urgent spinal treatment.
Conclusions: 
Urgent spinal stabilization is safe and appropriate in polytrauma patients when progressive neurologic deficit, thoracoabdominal trauma, or fracture instability increase the risks of delayed treatment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

Both surgery and recumbency have been adopted in the treatment of spinal fractures. Herein we present the indications for each, and our experience with thoracolumbar junction (T12, L1 and L2) burst fractures.
Methods: 
Sixty-eight patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated operatively in 36 cases, and nonoperatively in 32 with recumbency for 1-6 weeks. Treatment was based on clinical and radiological criteria. Eighty-one percent of the recumbency patients, but only 14% of the surgical patients were intact on admission. Patients were followed for a mean+/-SD of 9+/-10 months in the recumbency group, and 21+/-21 months in the surgical group.
Results: 
Neurological improvement and progressive angular deformity occurred in both groups. The cost of recumbency in our patients was nearly half that of those who required surgery, though the length of hospitalization between the two groups was similar at 1 month +/-2 weeks.
Conclusion: 
The above study emphasizes that the selection of operative versus nonoperative treatment in burst fractures should not be random but based on clinical as well as radiological criteria. Recumbency is favored in patients who are intact, with angular deformity less than 20 degrees , a residual spinal canal greater than 50% of normal, and an anterior body height exceeding 50% of the posterior height.

Objectives: 
To study the restoration and maintenance of normal spinal anatomy after open reduction and internal fixation of unstable burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Summary of background data: 
There are laboratory studies documenting the biomechanical advantages of the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems. There have been no previous comparisons of the internal spinal skeletal fixation system with the Hartshill rectangle and sublaminar wiring in matched patient groups.
Methods: 
Radiographs obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at 2 years after surgery were used to assess the restoration and maintenance of normal spinal anatomy in 14 patients who had undergone stabilization with the Hartshill System and in 12 patients who had undergone internal fixation using the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation system.
Results: 
The initial restoration of normal spinal anatomy was good using both systems. However, on examination 2 years after surgery, it was found that the AO system provided significantly superior maintenance of both middle (P < 0.01) and anterior column anatomy (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
The AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems is associated with significantly superior maintenance of spinal anatomy 2 years after surgery."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

An angle of kyphosis of 20 degrees or more evaluated using the sagittal index (s.i.) described by Farcy et al. in 1990, may be a valid indication for invasine treatment using pedicular systems for correction and stabilization; on the other hand, conservative treatment may be adequate for ensuring satisfactory results in fractures with an angle of less than 20 degrees, which are less likely to become unstable in clinically negative patients. This study confronts the immediate and long-term radiographic and clinical results in 2 groups of patients treated for amyelic thoracolumbar fractures, one treated conservatively, the other surgically; in particular, angle of kyphosis, vertebral compression and clinical conditions (pain and functional impairment) at long-term follow-up were assessed. The study was extended to include an assessment of outcome in relation to the angle of post-traumatic kyphosis in both operated and non-operated patients. Thirty-one patients with a diagnosis of non-neurological thoracolumbar trauma of the segment between D11 and L3 were studied. Twenty patients (group A) were treated conservatively (reduction on Cotrel bed and plaster vest) and 11 (group B) surgically (Diapason instrumentation). The 31 patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to the initial angle of kyphosis calculated using the s.i.: the first consisted of 16 patients (group C) with a s.i. of 20 degrees or more and the other of 15 patients (group D) with a s.i. less than 20 degrees. Six of the 16 group C patients and 5 of the 15 group D patients had been surgically treated. On the basis of the case-material considered, we found that satisfactory short-term radiographic results may be obtained by both conservative and surgical treatment. However, long-term outcome is less favorable in patients treated conservatively because maintainance of the initial improvement of the deformity in the injured segment is not as good as in those treated surgically. This limitation of conservative treatment does not however appear to negatively influence clinical conditions in patients with a s.i. of less than 20 degrees. In other words, although conservative treatment is not as effective as surgery for maintaining radiographic improvement, this does not necessarily signify clinical deterioration in cases with a s.i. of less than 20 degrees in whom the two types of treatment gave similar results."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 9 - НСО или НРИ [Records Excluded Step 9a NSR or NRS]"

A bisegmental construction is usual, which means that reduction and relief of the injured vertebral body is achieved indirectly by means of two intact vertebrae immediately adjacent on either side. As a result, both segments stiffen up or are permanently damaged in their function. We report on the possibility of single-segment fixation. The principle is the fusion of the injured segment itself only, i.e., the vertebra actually injured and the vertebra adjacent to the injured segment. Unnecessary fixation of a second healthy segment can thus be avoided. The characteristics of the fracture type in which single-segment stabilization is possible are explained. In a small study of the technique, we used the new AO classification of vertebral fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. The operation technique differs in some details from that applied with a multisegmental internal fixator. For example, the pedicle screws occasionally need to be inserted extremely close to the end-plates if the remaining part of the vertebral body has been destroyed and therefore cannot provide stability. Contraindications are broken pedicles and complete burst fractures of the body. With due consideration for these limitations fractures in all three main groups of the AO classification can, in principle, be stabilized in a single segment.

Roentgenograms were reviewed for severity of initial fracture, canal compromise, and maintenance of initial correction. In general, neurologically intact patients in both groups returned to similar postinjury employment levels.

Retrospective analysis of 16 patients.
Summary of background data: 
The lumbar split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which is type C1.2.1 fracture in the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation spine fracture classification. The axial compressive and torsional force shattered the vertebral body into 2 halves and displaced them rotationally. This kind of fracture is so highly unstable that the treatment is very challenging.
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study was to report and compare on clinical outcome and complications of patients with lumbar split fracture-dislocation which had been treated either short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion.
Materials and methods: 
A total of 16 patients with acute, split fracture-dislocation of the lumbar spine from March 2000 to May 2009 in our department were recruited. Seven patients (group I) treated by long-segment posterior fixation (2 levels above and 2 below the fracture) and anterior corpectomy and strut grafting. With the improvement of surgical technique and instrument, 9 patients after August 2004 were treated by short-segment posterior fixation (1 level above and 1 below, and included the fractured vertebrae itself) and anterior discectomy and strut grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, operation time, complications of operation, time to achieve bony fusion, Frankel scale, Oswestry Disability index, and Visual Analogue Pain Scale the Cobb angle were collected and compared.
Results: 
The mean follow-up was 33.4 months for group I and 36.2 months for group II. The operation time was 457.1 minutes in group I which was significantly longer than 240.0 minutes in group II. The total blood loss was for group I was 2001.4 mL (range, 1580-2500 mL) and for group II was 730.6 mL (range, 430-950 mL). There was no neurological deterioration after surgery in both group and no difference in neurological outcome between the 2 groups. The loss of correction in Cobb angle averaged at the final evaluation was 2 and 5 degrees for groups I and II, respectively. There was no radiologically visible pseudarthrosis. The postoperative Visual Analogue Pain Scale score was 3.3 and 2.7 for groups I and II, respectively. In the SF-36 survey, after surgery the domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in group B (P<0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). Time to achieve bony fusion in group I was 7.9 months which was significantly longer than 3.8 months in group II. Complications included 3 urinary infections, 1 decubitus ulcer, and 1 superficial infection that were cured by antibiotics. Screw breakage was found in 1 patient in the group II.
Conclusions: 
The lumbar sagittal split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which can be treated either with short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion.

Retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To examine perioperative characteristics among polytraumatized patients with operative, unstable spine fractures with and without concomitant operative long bone injuries.
Summary of background data: 
Treatment of polytrauma patients has delicate and time-sensitive protocols to ensure successful recovery. The literature defines standards for vertebral injury and surgical intervention.
Data: 
Severely polytraumatized patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)≥15 were divided according to those with operative spine fractures with operative long bone fractures (OSFLBF) and those with operative spine fractures alone (OSFA).
Methods: 
Patients were compared by sex, age, mechanism of injury (MOI), ISS, location of injuries, time spent inpatient before procedure(s), total time in the operating room, type of procedure(s) performed, estimated operative blood loss, complications, length of stay (LOS), and time to discharge.
Results: 
In a 12-year period, >600 patients were admitted to our level I trauma center with polytrauma and unstable spine fracture. Twelve had sustained operative unstable spine injuries and 21 had unstable spine injuries with a long bone injury requiring operative stabilization. Significant differences in ISS, LOS, MOI, region of vertebral injury, or total operating room time between the 2 groups were not observed. Differences were seen concerning average blood loss during surgery and time spent inpatient before entering the operating room. OSFLBF patients were discharged at a faster rate after 20 days compared with OSFSA patients.
Conclusions: 
No differences in ISS, LOS, MOI, region of vertebral injury or vertebral procedure, or total operating room time were observed. Blood loss was more substantial in the OSFLBF group, but it spent fewer days in the hospital preoperatively. Despite a nonstatistical difference in LOS, a larger proportion of OSFA patients remained in the hospital after being inpatient for >20 days, reducing the risk for iatrogenic complication in that group compared with OSFA.

To study therapeutic effects of self-designed canal decompressor in the posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, and provide evidence for widespread application.
Methods: 
From January 2008 to December 2008, the self-designed canal decompressor was used in 43 patients (30 males and 13 females, ranging in age from 22 to 49 years) with thoracolumbar burst fractures. According to Denis classification, there were 12 cases of type A, 24 cases of type B, 6 cases of type D and 1 case of type E. Affected segment: 16 patients in T12,19 patients in L1 and 8 patients in L2. The index of intra-operative blood loss, postoperative 24 h wound drainage volume, and operative time were compared with those of 16 patients who undergone traditional operation. The preoperative and postoperative vertebral canal volume, Cobb angles, residual vertebral body height, neurological outcome, and back pain were evaluated and compared.
Results: 
All the patients healed without wound infection, neurological symptoms and other complications. Forty-three patients were followed up ranging from 12 to 24 months, with a mean of (16.5 +/- 2.5) months. Compared with traditional posterior operation, the blood loss and operative time in modified posterior approach group had statistically significant difference, but the postoperative 24 h wound drainage had no significant difference between the two groups. CT scan indicated that applying the canal decompressor allowed efficient restore of canal volume from preoperative (49.4 +/- 16.7)% to postoperative (12.8 +/- 4.2)%. The X-ray showed Cobb angles reduced from preoperative (30.1 +/- 2.4)degrees to postoperative (5.1 +/- 0.6) degrees. Mean vertebral height was restored to (81.5 +/- 5.5)% after operation. Follow-up evaluation indicated that neurological recovery presented in 33 patients,with an average improvement of 0.87 Frankel grades. Neurological deterioration was not observed.
Conclusion: 
Applying the canal decompressor enables efficient and safe spinal decompression, restore the height of the injured vertebrae, reconstruction of the anterior-middle column stability,and prevention of postoperative vertebral height and Cobb angle lost."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 6 - осложненная травма [Records Excluded Step 6 TL Trauma SCI Present]"

Six unembalmed human thoracolumbar spine specimens (T10-L4) were used. Following intact testing, a simulated L1 burst fracture was created and sequentially stabilized using 5.5-mm titanium polyaxial pedicle screws and rods for 4 different constructs: SSPF (1 level above and below), SSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level), LSPF (2 levels above and below), and LSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level).

Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to identify differences between treatment groups and functional noninstrumented spine. Short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation did not achieve stability seen in an intact spine (P<.01), whereas LSPF constructs were significantly stiffer than SSPF constructs and demonstrated more stiffness than an intact spine (P<.01). Pedicle screws at the fracture level did not improve either SSPF or LSPF construct stability (P>.1).

Increased structural stability is considered sufficient justification for higher-risk surgical procedures, such as circumferential fixation after severe spinal destabilization. However, there is little biomechanical evidence to support such claims, particularly after traumatic lumbar burst fracture. The authors sought out to compare the biomechanical performance of the following 3 fixation strategies for spinal reconstruction after decompression for an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture: 1) short-segment anterolateral fixation; 2) circumferential fixation; and 3) extended anterolateral fixation.
Methods: 
Thoracolumbar spines (T10-L4) from 7 donors (mean age at death 64+/-6 years; 1 female and 6 males) were tested in pure moment loading in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Thoracolumbar burst fractures were surgically induced at L-1, and testing was repeated sequentially for each of the following fixation techniques: short-segment anterolateral, circumferential, and extended anterolateral. Primary and coupled 3D motions were measured across the instrumented site (T12-L2) and compared across treatment groups.
Results: 
Circumferential and extended anterolateral fixations were statistically equivalent for primary and off-axis range-of-motions in all loading directions, and short-segment anterolateral fixation offered significantly less rigidity than the other 2 methods.
Conclusions: 
The results of this study strongly suggest that extended anterolateral fixation is biomechanically comparable to circumferential fusion in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with posterior column and posterior ligamentous injury. In cases in which an anterior procedure may be favored for load sharing or canal decompression, extension of the anterior instrumentation and fusion one level above and below the unstable segment can result in near equivalent stability to a 2-stage circumferential procedure."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 1 - фаза 0-1 [Records Excluded Step 1 Animal or Cadaver or Biomech or In Vitro or In Silico or Healthy]"

Commonly used fixation techniques may include monofilament wires, sublaminar wires and cables, and pedicle screws. Unfortunately, neurological complications can occur with all of these, compromising the patients' health and quality of life. Recently, an alternative fixation technique using a metal clamp and polyester belt was developed to replace hooks and sublaminar wiring in scoliosis surgery. The goal of this study was to compare the pull-out strength of this new construct with sublaminar wiring, laminar hooks and pedicle screws. Forty thoracic vertebrae from five fresh frozen human thoracic spines (T5-12) were divided into five groups (8 per group), such that BMD values, pedicle diameter, and vertebral levels were equally distributed. They were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate and anchored with metal screws and polyethylene bands. One of five fixation methods was applied to the right side of the vertebra in each group: Pedicle screw, sublaminar belt with clamp, figure-8 belt with clamp, sublaminar wire, or laminar hook. Pull-out strength was then assessed using a custom jig in a servohydraulic tester. The mean failure load of the pedicle screw group was significantly larger than that of the figure-8 clamp (P = 0.001), sublaminar belt (0.0172), and sublaminar wire groups (P = 0.04) with no significant difference in pull-out strength between the latter three constructs. The most common mode of failure was the fracture of the pedicle. BMD was significantly correlated with failure load only in the figure-8 clamp and pedicle screw constructs. Only the pedicle screw had a statistically significant higher failure load than the sublaminar clamp. The sublaminar method of applying the belt and clamp device was superior to the figure-8 method. The sublaminar belt and clamp construct compared favorably to the traditional methods of sublaminar wires and laminar hooks, and should be considered as an alternative fixation device in the thoracic spine."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 1 - фаза 0-1 [Records Excluded Step 1 Animal or Cadaver or Biomech or In Vitro or In Silico or Healthy]"

Although minimally invasive posterior spine implant systems have been introduced, clinical studies reported on reduced quality of spinal column realignment due to correction loss. The aim of this study was to compare biomechanically two minimally invasive spine stabilization systems versus the Universal Spine Stabilization system (USS).
Methods: 
Three groups with 5 specimens each and 2 foam bars per specimen were instrumented with USS (Group 1) or a minimally invasive posterior spine stabilization system with either polyaxial (Group 2) or monoaxial (Group 3) screws. Mechanical testing was performed under quasi-static ramp loading in axial compression and torsion, followed by destructive cyclic loading run under axial compression at constant amplitude and then with progressively increasing amplitude until construct failure. Bending construct stiffness, torsional stiffness and cycles to failure were investigated.
Results: 
Initial bending stiffness was highest in Group 3, followed by Group 2 and Group 1, without any significant differences between the groups. A significant increase in bending stiffness after 20'000 cycles was observed in Group 1 (p = 0.002) and Group 2 (p = 0.001), but not in Group 3, though the secondary bending stiffness showed no significant differences between the groups. Initial and secondary torsional stiffness was highest in Group 1, followed by Group 3 and Group 2, with significant differences between all groups (p ≤ 0.047). A significant increase in initial torsional stiffness after 20'000 cycles was observed in Group 2 (p = 0.017) and 3 (p = 0.013), but not in Group 1. The highest number of cycles to failure was detected in Group 1, followed by Group 3 and Group 2. This parameter was significantly different between Group 1 and Group 2 (p = 0.001), between Group 2 and Group 3 (p = 0.002), but not between Group 1 and Group 3.

These findings quantify the correction loss for minimally invasive spine implant systems and imply that unstable spine fractures might benefit from stabilization with conventional implants like the USS."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 1 - фаза 0-1 [Records Excluded Step 1 Animal or Cadaver or Biomech or In Vitro or In Silico or Healthy]"

To use imaging, histology and electrophysiological assessment to compare the Wiltse approach to pedicle fixation with the conventional posterior open approach for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
We analyzed clinical and histopathological information of consecutive patients with thoracolumbar fractures who underwent short-segment pedicle fixation using either the Wiltse approach or the posterior open approach. Seventy-five patients were enrolled between June 2010 and August 2014 (Wiltse group 35 cases; posterior open group 40 cases). The two groups were compared for MRI appearance, histological and electrophysiological changes in multifidus muscle.
Results: 
On MRI, multifidus cross-sectional area (CSA) in the Wiltse group decreased by only 7.6% between pre-op and the last follow-up, compared to 35.4% in the posterior open group, and less fatty infiltration was found in the Wiltse group. Histologically, post-op (removal of internal fixation) tissue from the posterior open group showed disordered myofibrils, with diameter and CSA decreased by 11.6 and 24.3%, respectively; also, the myofibril gap became larger with fat deposition and scar formation. The Wiltse group had no such significant changes. Electrophysiologically, in the posterior open group, median frequency slope (MFs) significantly increased by 67.6% with average amplitude (AA) significantly decreased by 17.5% between pre-op and 12 months post-op. No significant changes were found in the Wiltse group. At 12 months post-op, AA was significantly lower and MFs was higher in the posterior open group than the Wiltse group.
Conclusion: 
The Wiltse approach showed a lower incidence of multifidus atrophy and denervation, and less fatty infiltration.

Previous studies of conventional surgical procedures have shown a significant rate of incorrect pedicle screw placement ranging from 10 to 40%.

The aim of this prospective study is to improve the reliability of pedicle screwing with computer assistance.
Material and methods: 
A new and original technique that combines preoperative computed tomography imaging with intraoperative passive navigation has been used to perform 48 pedicle screwings in the thoracolumbar region. In the same time, 48 pedicle screwings were performed manually in the same region and on the same vertebral levels. With postoperative X-rays and computed tomography examination, screw position related to pedicle position could be assessed and comparison could be made between the two groups (with and without computer assistance).
Results: 
Two screws in 48 vertebra (4%) had incorrect placement with computer assisted technique whereas 18 screws in 48 vertebra (37%) had incorrect placement with manual insertion. The intraoperative accuracy provided by the computer after registration was better than 1 mm. The difference between the two groups was statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001). The cortex penetration observed with the computer assisted technique was not imputed to computer failures. Errors in acquiring data by the surgeon in the pre and peroperative steps may explain the two incorrect placements of the screws.

Augmentation of pedicle screws is recommended in selected indications (for instance: osteoporosis). Generally, there are two techniques for pedicle screw augmentation: inserting the screw in the non cured cement and in situ-augmentation with cannulated fenestrated screws, which can be applied percutaneously. Most of the published studies used an axial pull out test for evaluation of the pedicle screw anchorage. However, the loading and the failure mode of pullout tests do not simulate the cranio-caudal in vivo loading and failure mechanism of pedicle screws. The purpose of the present study was to assess the fixation effects of different augmentation techniques (including percutaneous cement application) and to investigate pedicle screw loosening under physiological cyclic cranio-caudal loading.
Methods: 
Each of the two test groups consisted of 15 vertebral bodies (L1-L5, three of each level per group). Mean age was 84.3 years (SD 7.8) for group 1 and 77.0 years (SD 7.00) for group 2. Mean bone mineral density was 53.3 mg/cm3 (SD 14.1) for group 1 and 53.2 mg/cm3 (SD 4.3) for group 2. 1.5 ml high viscosity PMMA bone cement was used for all augmentation techniques. For test group 1, pedicles on the right side of the vertebrae were instrumented with solid pedicle screws in standard fashion without augmentation and served as control group. Left pedicles were instrumented with cannulated screws (Viper cannulated, DePuy Spine) and augmented. For test group 2 pedicles on the left side of the vertebrae were instrumented with cannulated fenestrated screws and in situ augmented. On the right side solid pedicle screws were augmented with cement first technique. Each screw was subjected to a cranio-caudal cyclic load starting at 20-50 N with increasing upper load magnitude of 0.1 N per cycle (1 Hz) for a maximum of 5000 cycles or until total failure. Stress X-rays were taken after cyclic loading to evaluate screw loosening.
Results: 
Test group 1 showed a significant higher number of load cycles until failure for augmented screws compared to the control (4030 cycles, SD 827.8 vs. 1893.3 cycles, SD 1032.1; p < 0.001). Stress X-rays revealed significant less screw toggling for the augmented screws (5.2°, SD 5.4 vs. 16.1°, SD 5.9; p < 0.001). Test group 2 showed 3653.3 (SD 934) and 3723.3 (SD 560.6) load cycles until failure for in situ and cement first augmentation. Stress X-rays revealed a screw toggling of 5.1 (SD 1.9) and 6.6 (SD 4.6) degrees for in situ and cement first augmentation techniques (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Augmentation of pedicle screws in general significantly increased the number of load cycles and failure load comparing to the nonaugmented control group. For the augmentation technique (cement first, in situ augmented, percutaneously application) no effect could be exhibited on the failure of the pedicle screws. By the cranio-caudal cyclic loading failure of the pedicle screws occurred by screw cut through the superior endplate and the characteristic ""windshield-wiper effect"", typically observed in clinical practice, could be reproduced."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 1 - фаза 0-1 [Records Excluded Step 1 Animal or Cadaver or Biomech or In Vitro or In Silico or Healthy]"

Retrospective chart review of one surgeon's practice.
Objective: 
We evaluate the perioperative morbidity of 43 patients undergoing minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion to differentiate risks between primary and revision surgery candidates.
Summary of background data: 
Minimally invasive approaches to the lumbar spine have rapidly evolved and the technical feasibility and safety of minimally invasive interbody fusion is well established. Revision surgery is technically more challenging and may cause avoidance of such approaches because of altered anatomy and absent bony landmarks. Description of minimally invasive surgery approaches among revision patients and the feasibility of such techniques demands clarification.
Methods: 
Forty-three consecutive minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions (TLIFs) and posterior lumbar interbody fusions (PLIFs) were reviewed. Estimated blood loss, operative time, and complication rates were compared between primary and revision patients using Student t tests.
Results: 
Seventeen revision surgery cases (40%) were compared with 26 primary surgeries (60%) to elucidate differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, and complications. Demographic variables were similar in both groups. Estimated blood loss trended higher among the PLIF group and among revision cases, though no statistical significance was observed. A higher rate of complications, most notably incidental durotomy, was observed among revision cases in both PLIF and TLIF patients. One patient undergoing primary surgery had an intraoperative pedicle fracture, and 1 patient undergoing revision surgery had an asymptomatic screw malposition. No patients had a major complication, nerve injury, infection, or conversion to an open procedure.
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion by revision surgery is technically feasible and is not associated with more blood loss or neurologic morbidity. However, revision surgery has a higher minor perioperative complication rate, particularly of incidental durotomy. These outcomes demand significant experience before attempting minimally invasive revision surgery in the lumbar spine."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 6b - последствия травм [Records Excluded Step 6b Late TL Trauma]"

A prospective review was done of a new intraoperative technique developed to detect and prevent neurologic compromise during pedicle screw insertion.
Objectives: 
To describe in sufficient detail the technique of persistently electrified pedicle stimulation instruments, so that this technique will be available generally to all clinical neurophysiologists and spine surgeons; and to demonstrate the use, typical results, interpretation, and protocol of the technique.
Summary and background data: 
Fusion techniques that use pedicle instrumentation have the potential to cause nerve root injury. Several authors have proposed imaging and neurophysiologic methods to improve outcome. The present method represents a significant theoretical departure and advance from previously reported methods.
Methods: 
All relevant instruments used during pedicle instrumentation were converted easily, inexpensively, and quickly into monopolar stimulators with appropriate stimulus voltages to identify broaches of pedicle bone via evoked-electromyograms from relevant muscle groups.
Results: 
The persistently electrified pedicle stimulation instrument technique provided accurate intraoperative neurophysiologic information concerning pedicle, integrity in the patients studied. The protocol is standardized and adaptable easily, inexpensively, and quickly to most clinical applications.

Posterior longitudinal ligament reduction (PLLR) has been widely used for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, there are no systemic studies assessing the influence of position parameters of intra-canal fracture fragment (IFF) itself on outcome of reduction. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between position parameters of IFF and the reduction efficacy of PLLR.
Methods: 
Sixty-two patients (average age, 36.9 years) with single thoracolumbar burst fractures and intact posterior longitudinal ligaments were recruited. Patients were divided into reduced and unreduced groups based on IFF reduction situations by PLLR. Preoperative and intraoperative computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate reduction and location parameters of IFF, such as position, width, height, inversion, and horizontal angle, ratio of width of IFF to the transverse diameter of vertebral canal (R 1), and ratio of height of IFF to height of injured vertebrae (R 2) before and after PLLR.
Results: 
There were significant differences in width (P < 0.001), height (P = 0.0141; R 1, P < 0.001), and R 2 (P = 0.0045) between the two groups. When width of IFF was more than 75 % of transverse diameter of vertebral canal and height of IFF was more than 47 % of height of injured vertebrae, the IFF could not be reduced by PLLR.
Conclusions: 
In patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, IFF in apterium of the posterior longitudinal ligament cannot be reduced by PLLR. For thoracolumbar burst fractures that cover the posterior longitudinal ligament, the width and height of IFF are important parameters that influence reduction quality."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 8 - не хирургия [Records Excluded Step 8 No Surgery in the Spine]"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiographic findings associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures could also indicate the presence of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries, which were identified through short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR)-weighted MRI.
Patients and method: 
Sixty-four patients were surgically treated for thoracolumbar burst fractures between April 2007 and February 2014 at our institution. Twenty-four patients were excluded from this study because of the lack of STIR-weighted MRIs, and therefore 40 patients were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based upon the integrity of the PLC, which was evaluated using STIR-weighted MRI: a P group with a PLC injury and a C group without such injury. The following radiographic parameters were evaluated: loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), local kyphosis (LK), vertebral body translation, canal compromise (sagittal transverse ratio, STR), interlaminar distance (ISD), supraspinous distance (SSD) and interspinous distance (ISD). Frankel scale score and total severity score (load sharing and thoracolumbar injury classification systems, respectively) were also evaluated.
Results: 
Preoperative STIR-weighted MRI showed that 25 patients had a PLC injury (P group: 15 men and 10 women), and 15 patients did not have a PLC injury (C group: 8 men and 7 women). More patients in the P group had an LK>20°: 14 patients in the P group and 1 patient in the C group (p<0.01). The % SSD differed between the P and C groups (118.8%±53.4% and 88.0%±24.3%, respectively; p<0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that an LK>20° was a risk factor for PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (odds ratio, 55.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.30-2360.1]; p<0.05).
Conclusions: 
These results demonstrate that while LOVBH, vertebral body translation, and canal compromise do not correlate significantly with the presence of a PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar fractures, an LK>20° and increased % SSD are associated with a PLC injury."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 8 - не хирургия [Records Excluded Step 8 No Surgery in the Spine]"

The resulting 'enhanced tipping-point displays' are convenient summaries of conclusions obtained from making different modeling assumptions about missingness mechanisms. The primary goal of the displays is to make formal sensitivity analysesmore comprehensible to practitioners, thereby helping them assess the robustness of the experiment's conclusions to plausible missingness mechanisms.

To evaluate the efficacy of single-stage posterior vertebral column resection for old thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations with spinal cord injury.
Methods: 
From January 2007 to June 2013, twelve male patients (average age, 32.6 years; range 19-57 years) with old fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord injury underwent single-stage posterior vertebral column resection and internal fixation. All patients were assessed for relief of the pain and restoration of neurologic function. Postoperative Cobb angle was measured and bone graft fusion was evaluated by X-ray. A systematic review of 25 studies evaluating surgical management of thoracolumbar fractures with spinal cord injuries was also performed.
Results: 
From our case series, six of the nine patients with Frankel grade A had significant improvement in urination and defecation after surgery. The three patients with Frankel grades B and C had progression of 1-2 grades after surgery. Bony fusion was achieved and local back pain was relieved in all patients after surgery. From our systematic review of 25 studies, the majority of patients had improved back pain, the postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly reduced compared with pre-operative kyphotic angle.
Conclusion: 
Single-stage posterior vertebral column resection and internal fixation for old thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations is an ideal treatment allowing for thorough decompression, relief of pain, correction of deformities, and restoration of spinal stability.

In a biomechanical in vitro study, burst fracture stabilization was simulated and anterior short fixation devices were tested under load with pure moments to evaluate the biomechanical stabilizing characteristics of the new system in comparison with a currently available system. With interbody graft and fixation the new system demonstrated higher stabilizing effects in flexion/extension and lateral bending and restored axial stability beyond the intact spine, as well as having comparable or improved effects compared with the current system.

Optimal timing of stabilization for spinal injuries is discussed controversially. The goal of this study is to investigate the neurological recovery and its influencing factors in thoracolumbar spine fractures after surgical decompression and stabilization within 8 h of spinal cord injury versus surgery which is performed between 3 and 15 days.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven patients undergoing thoracolumbar stabilization with neurological deficit for an acute thoracolumbar spinal injury at the level of Th8-L2 vertebra at Selcuk University between March 2004 and December 2006 were recorded. Patients with neurological deficit and medically stable for surgery underwent immediate stabilization within 8 h defined as group I (n = 12) and patients underwent operation in 3-15 days after thoracolumbar injury were defined as group II (n = 15). Patients were assessed for neurologic deficit and improvement as defined by the scoring system of American spinal injury association (ASIA).
Results: 
In spite of comparable demographic data, patients in group I had a significantly shorter overall hospital and intensive care unit stay and had lesser systemic complications such as pneumonia and also exhibited better neurological improvement than group II (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Early surgery may improve neurological recovery and decrease hospitalization time and also additional systemic complications in patients with thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries. Thus early stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures within 8 h after trauma appears to be favorable."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 6 - осложненная травма [Records Excluded Step 6 TL Trauma SCI Present]"

A retrospective comparative study.
Objective: 
To investigate the risk factors associated with upper instrumented vertebral (UIV) fractures in adult lumbar deformity.
Summary of background data: 
Long segment lumbar fusions may lead to junctional failures. The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with junctional failures.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven consecutive patients from 2001 to 2008 with minimum 4 levels fused, lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) of L5 or S1, upper instrumented vertebra of T10 or distal, and no previous surgery proximal to the instrumentation were retrospectively reviewed. We describe the UIV angle, the sagittal angle of the upper instrumented vertebra with the horizontal. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, 7 patients with UIV fractures; group 2, 6 patients with other proximal failures; and group 3, 14 patients with no proximal complications.
Results: 
The mean number of levels fused was 5.7 (4-7), 5.2 (4-8), and 6.2 (4-8); mean age was 64.1, 61.8, and 64.1, and mean body mass index was 33.5, 30.0, and 31.6 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P > 0.05). Osteotomies were performed in 5 of 7 in group 1, 1 of 6 in group 2, and 5 of 14 in group 3. Mean follow-up was 26.3 months. The average intraoperative UIV angle (UIV0) and immediate postoperative UIV angle (UIV1) were 18.6°/15.4° for group 1, 5.7°/5.3° for group 2, and 10.3°/7.1° for group 3 (P < 0.05). Surgical revision rates were higher in group 1 (71%) compared with groups 2 (50%) and 3 (43%). Eight of 11 (73%) patients with upper instrumented vertebra of L1 or L2 had either UIV fracture or other proximal failure compared with 5 of 16 (31%) in patients with upper instrumented vertebra of T10, T11, or T12.
Conclusion: 
Our series of long lumbar fusions had a high long-term complication and revision rate. A high UIV angle on intraoperative lateral radiograph was strongly associated with UIV fractures. UIVs of L1 or L2 had a higher rate of adjacent segment or UIV failure."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 5c - не травма [Records Excluded Step 5c TL Spine Other Than Trauma]"

The optimal form of treatment for C2 spine fractures is controversial. This investigation analyzed the variations in treatment of C2 fractures over time, by age group, and by geographic location.
Methods: 
The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample database was queried to identify patients 18 years and older who sustained C2 fracture without neurologic injury from 2006 to 2012. Subsequently, patients were further filtered based on the intervention they received: collar, halo, and surgery. Regions of hospital used in analysis were defined as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Linear regression models were used to analyze trends for C2 incidence rates and treatment type. Analysis of variance tests were used to determine differences among procedure groups when stratified by regions and age groups.
Results: 
Surgical intervention for C2 fracture increased from 36.5% in 2006 to 55.7% in 2012 (r = 0.116, P < 0.001). In contrast, the rate of halo use decreased from 57.8% in 2006 to 37.1% in 2012 (r = -0.139, P < 0.001). Surgery displayed increasing trend across all age groups. A greater proportion of patients in the Northeast were treated by collar compared with all other regions (P < 0.001). In contrast, halo use was significantly lower in the Northeast than the other 3 regions (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
This investigation demonstrated that surgical management of C2 fractures is increasing in frequency over time and at all age groups. Furthermore, the treatment of these fractures varies by region-the Northeast had the highest incidence of collar use and lowest rate of halo use."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 4a - шея [Records Excluded Step 4a Adult C-Spine]"

After dorsal stabilisation of vertebral fractures by an internal fixateur the postoperative computed tomography is a standard procedure to control the positions of the pedicle screws, the success of the reposition, the clearance of the spinal canal and to plane an additive secondary ventral stabilisation. An intraoperative scan with a 3D image intensifier may clarify these questions directly after the implantation with the possibility of an immediate correction of the implants. The aim of this study was to find out the optimal point of time to perform an intraoperative 3D scan and if a postoperative computed tomography is dispensable.
Patients and methods: 
Intraoperative 3D scans were carried out on 33 patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures (T11-L5) after bi-segmental fixateur interne montage (Group 1). A matched pair group of 33 patients (Group 2) with a 3D scan after implantation of pedicle screws was built. A postoperative computed tomography of the instrumented spinal section was done in all patients. The following measurements were done in sagittal and axial reconstruction planes and were compared: classification of screw positions, maximal axial diameter of pedicles, cortical perforation of the screws. Additionally in Group 1 the distance between the upper and lower end plates of the injured section, the height of posterior vertebral body wall, the dislocation of the posterior wall and the minimal diameter of the spinal canal were measured.
Results: 
The intraoperative scoring of pedicle screws positions and the measurement of pedicle width showed in both groups a significant accordance with the computed tomography determinations. The measurements ""posterior wall dislocation"" and ""diameter of spinal canal"" were only possible in 24 3D scans and showed a significant difference compared with the CT data. The picture quality in Group 2 was scored significantly better than for Group 1 with the complete assembly of the fixateur.
Conclusion: 
The ideal point of time for an intraoperative 3D imaging with the present intensifier generation is directly after pedicle screw insertion. The reliable determination of the spinal canal diameter, of posterior wall fragments and of the exact fracture morphology is only possible by postoperative computed tomography."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>false, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: шаг 8a - не та хирургия [Records Excluded Step 8a Surgery Not Directly Relevant]"
