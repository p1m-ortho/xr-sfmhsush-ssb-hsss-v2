To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) and open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) in the treatment of single level of thoracolumbar fracture.
Methods: 
Databases including Pubmed, Embasem, CNKI were searched to collect clinical trials of the clinical safety and efficiency of PPSF and OPSF for single level of thoracolumbar unstable fracture, relevant proceedings and references were also retrieved manually. Studies from 1990 to 2014 that met the inclusion and exclusion standards were researched. The data were extracted and the methods from the studies were also evaluated. Data analysis was conducted with the Review Manager 5.3 software. Observation targets included operation time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative bleeding, hospitalization time, the bed time, postoperative vertebral Cobb angle, vertebral body height, pain score and the length of incision operation.
Results: 
Fifteen papers were finally studied, including 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 13 case-control studies, involving 789 patients. Compared with OPSF, the PPSF in treating thoracolumbar fracture had shorter operation time, smaller operation incision, less intraoperative and postoperation bleeding, shorter hospitalization days, fewer pain (P<0.00001), the less improvement in the change of Cobb angle (P=0.0006). There was no significant difference in the improvement of vertebral body height (P=0.36), the bed time from operation to exercise (P=0.38) between OPSF and PPSF.
Conclusion: 
Compared with OPSF, PPSF is better, safer, and has fewer pain. But there is no evidence that the PPSF is better in the recovery of the spinal height, and they have the same effect in the long-term follow-up for thoracolumbar fractures. PPSF brines minimally invasive to patients with better effect. It is worth further study and clinical research."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment of a stable burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction in neurologically intact patients have not shown a meaningful difference at early follow-up. To our knowledge, longer-term outcome data have not before been presented.
Methods: 
From 1992 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were evaluated and randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative treatment (posterior or anterior arthrodesis) or nonoperative treatment (a body cast or orthosis). We previously reported the results of follow-up at an average of forty-four months. The current study presents the results of long-term follow-up, at an average of eighteen years (range, sixteen to twenty-two years). As in the earlier study, patients at long-term follow-up indicated the degree of pain on a visual analog scale and completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Work and health status were obtained, and patients were evaluated radiographically.
Results: 
Of the original operatively treated group of twenty-four patients, follow-up data were obtained for nineteen; one patient had died, and four could not be located. Of the original nonoperatively treated group of twenty-three patients, data were obtained for eighteen; two patients had died, and three could not be located. The average kyphosis was not significantly different between the two groups (13° for those who received operative treatment compared with 19° for those treated nonoperatively). Median scores for pain (4 cm for the operative group and 1.5 cm for the nonoperative group; p = 0.003), ODI scores (20 for the operative group and 2 for the nonoperative group; p <0.001) and Roland and Morris scores (7 for the operative group and 1 for the nonoperative group; p = 0.001) were all significantly better in the group treated nonoperatively. Seven of eight SF-36 scores also favored nonoperative treatment.
Conclusions: 
While early analysis (four years) revealed few significant differences between the two groups, at long-term follow-up (sixteen to twenty-two years), those with a stable burst fracture who were treated nonoperatively reported less pain and better function compared with those who were treated surgically."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The surgical results of treating thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were reported to be comparable between patients with and without fusion in an intermediate-term follow-up. To our knowledge, no prior report has compared the results of fusion and non-fusion with long-term follow-up.
Methods: 
This study was designed to provide long-term evaluation of patients with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine treated with short-segment fixation who were randomly assigned to a fusion or non-fusion group. Patients older than sixty years of age at the time of injury and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough Low-Back Outcome Score and the visual analog scale for back pain. Radiographic outcomes were focused on the vertebral body height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the regional segmental motion.
Results: 
Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the non-fusion group, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the fusion group. The average follow-up period was 134 months (range, 121 to 161 months). The average preoperative kyphotic angle was 16.4° for the non-fusion group and 19.5° for the fusion group. The average postoperative kyphotic angle was 1.5° for the non-fusion group and 4.0° for the fusion group. At the time of the latest follow-up, the average kyphotic angle was 13.8° for the non-fusion group and 14.7° for the fusion group. The average kyphotic angle between the two groups was similar at all follow-up times. A progressive decrease of the kyphotic angle was significant (p < 0.05) with time, regardless of fusion. The radiographic outcomes were similar between these two groups at all follow-up times, as were functional outcomes. More patients in the non-fusion group underwent additional surgery to remove implants. Regional segmental motion was preserved in the non-fusion group, with a mean motion (and standard deviation) of 4.2° ± 1.9°.
Conclusions: 
The long-term results of short segmental fixation with and without fusion for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were comparable. Regional segmental motion could be preserved without fusion, and bone graft donor site complications could be eliminated.

Seventy patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures were treated by short-segment pedicle screw fixation and were randomly divided into two groups. Fractures in group A (n=20) were reinforced with posterior morselized bone grafting in vertebrae for spinal fusion, while patients group B (n=50) did not receive the morselized bone grafting for bone fusion. The two groups were compared in terms of kyphotic deformity, anterior vertebral height, instrument failure and neurological functions after the treatment. Frankel grading system was used for the evaluation of neurological evaluation and Denis scoring scale was employed for pain assessment. The results showed that the kyphosis correction was achieved in both group A and group B (group A: 6.4 degree; group B: 5.4 degree)/ At the end of follow-up, kyphosis correction was maintained in group A but lost in group B (P=0.0001). Postoperatively, greater anterior height was achieved in group A than in group B (P<0.01). During follow-up study, anterior vertebral height was maintained only in Group A (P<0.001). Both group A and group B showed good Denis pain scores (P1 and P2) but group A outdid group B in terms of control of severe and constant pain (P4 and P5). By Frankel criteria, the changes in neurological functions in group A was better than those of group B (P<0.001). It is concluded that reinforcement of short-segment pedicle fixation with morselized bone grafting for the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture could achieve and maintain kyphosis correction, and it may also increase and maintain anterior vertebral height. Morselized bone grafting in vertebrae offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar vertebrate fractures, decreases the instrument failure and provides better postoperative pain control than without the morselized bone grafting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Thoracolumbar junction burst fractures remain a challenging problem due to controversy over the treatment choice of short- or long-segment posterior fixation. The aim of the present study was to compare life quality and sexual function of patients after short- and long-segment posterior fixations in the treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.
Methods: 
In this prospective, randomized study, 24 sexually active male patients diagnosed with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures were randomly assigned to either the short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) group or the long-segment posterior fixation group (LLPF). The exclusion criteria were rheumatological disease and spinal surgery history. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index or smoking habits between the groups. The life quality score of EQ-5D and the International Index of erectile function (IIEF-5) score of male patients and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score of female partners were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.
Results: 
The mean age of patients in the SSPF and LSPF groups was 44.58 and 42.92 years, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the preoperative EQ-5D and IIEF-5 scores of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners. Postoperatively, the EQ-5D scores (p = 0.011) and IIEF-5 scores (p = 0.000) of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners (p = 0.001) were better in the short-segment group.
Conclusions: 
Patients treated with SSPF have better sexual function and life quality with their partners compared to those treated with LSPF. The main clinical relevance of this study is that the impact of the choice of short or long-segment treatment on postoperative sexual function and life quality should be considered by surgeons when performing posterior fixation after thoracolumbar junction burst fractures."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Decision-making regarding nonoperative versus operative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in the absence of neurologic deficits is controversial. Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately and being exposed to unnecessary adverse consequences.
Purpose: 
Using meta-analysis, we therefore compared pain (VAS) and function (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit treated nonoperatively and operatively. Secondary outcomes included return to work, radiographic progression of kyphosis, radiographic progression of spinal canal stenosis, complications, cost, and length of hospitalization.
Methods: 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE(®), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for 'thoracic fractures', 'lumbar fractures', 'non-operative', 'operative' and 'controlled clinical trials'. We established five criteria for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The main analyses were performed on individual patient data from randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed on VAS pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score, kyphosis, and return to work, including data from nonrandomized controlled trials and using fixed effects meta-analysis. We identified four trials, including two randomized controlled trials consisting of 79 patients (41 with operative treatment and 38 with nonoperative treatment). The mean followups ranged from 24 to 118 months.
Results: 
We found no between-group differences in baseline pain, kyphosis, and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. At last followup, there were no between-group differences in pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores, and return to work rates. We found an improvement in kyphosis ranging from means of 12.8º to 11º in the operative group, but surgery was associated with higher complication rates and costs.
Conclusions: 
Operative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit may improve residual kyphosis, but does not appear to improve pain or function at an average of 4 years after injury and is associated with higher complication rates and costs.

In a prospective randomized study, eighty patients with thoracolumbar fractures treated just with posterior pedicular fixation were randomized into two groups receiving either the one level above and one level below excluding the fracture level (bridging group), or including the fracture level (including group). Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded and followed. A sum of 80 patients (42 patients in group 1 and 38 patients in group 2) were enrolled in the study.

The significant effect of the ""including"" technique on the reduction of kyphotic deformity was most prominent in type C fractures. In conclusion, inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers a better kyphosis correction, in addition to fewer instrument failures, without additional complications, and with a comparable-if not better-clinical and functional outcome.

In this prospective randomized study, the results of treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures by pedicle instrumentation with and without fracture level screw combination were given.
Objective: 
Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of fracture level screw combination in achieving and maintaining correction in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Most authors reported that intraoperative correction of sagittal deformity is important for the maintenance of fracture reduction and is one of the most consistent predictor of satisfactory functional outcome.
Methods: 
Seventy-two patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomized into 4 groups with equal number of patients.

Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and at follow-up.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 50 months. Fracture level screw combination provided better intraoperative correction and maintenance in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, which was more prevalent in short-segment fixation group.

The impact of fusion as a supplement to short-segment instrumentation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is unclear. We conducted a controlled clinical trial to define the effect of fusion on lumbar spine and patient-related functional outcomes.
Methods: 
From 2000 to 2002, seventy-three consecutive patients with a single-level Denis type-B burst fracture involving the thoracolumbar spine and a load-sharing score of <or=6 were managed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with posterolateral fusion (fusion group, n = 37) or without posterolateral fusion (nonfusion group, n = 36). The patients were followed for at least five years after surgery and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with use of the Frankel scale, the motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, a visual analog scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Radiographic outcomes were assessed on the basis of the local kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction.
Results: 
No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between the patients managed with the two techniques.

Objectives: 
To compare the results of fusion versus nonfusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine.
Summary of background data: 
The operative results of surgically treated burst fractures with short segmental fixation have been well documented. There is no report comparing the results of fusion and nonfusion.
Methods: 
Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, with the inclusion criteria as follows: neurologically intact spine with a kyphotic angle > or = 20 degrees, decreased vertebral body height > or = 50% or a canal compromise > or = 50%, incomplete neurologic deficit with a canal compromise 50%, complete neurologic deficit, and multilevel spinal injury or multiple traumas. All patients were randomly assigned to fusion or nonfusion groups, and operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation was carried out. Posterior fusion with autogenous bone graft was performed for the fusion group (n = 30), and no fusion procedure was done for the nonfusion group (n = 28). The average follow-up period was 41 months (range, 24-71 months).
Results: 
The average loss of kyphotic angle was not statistically significant between these 2 groups. The radiographic parameters were statistically significantly better in the nonfusion group, including angular change in the flexion-extension lateral view (4.8 degrees vs. 1.0 degrees), lost correction of decreased vertebral body height (3.6% vs. 8.3%), intraoperative estimated blood loss (303 mL vs. 572 mL), and operative time (162 minutes vs. 224 minutes). The scores on the low back outcome scale were not statistically significant for these 2 groups.
Conclusions: 
The short-term results of short segmental fixation without fusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were satisfactory.

Summary of background data: 
There are no comparative randomized clinical studies on the outcome following operative treatment of mid-lumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Forty consecutive patients with L2-L4 fresh single A3-type/AO burst fractures and load sharing score up to 6 were randomly selected to underwent either combined one-stage anterior stabilization with mesh cage and SSTF (Group A) or solely SSTF with intermediate screws in the fractured vertebra (Group B). Kyphotic Gardner angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height (PVBHr, AVBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), SF-36, VAS, and Frankel classification were used.
Results: 
The follow-up observation averaged 46 and 48 months for Group A and B, respectively. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were significant more in Group A. More surgical complications were observed in the Group A. After surgery, VAS was reduced to 4.3 and 3.6 for Group A and Group B, respectively. The SF-36 domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in Group B (P = 0.05) and (P = 0.06), respectively. Correction of AVBHr, PVBHr, and spinal canal clearance was similar in both groups. Spinal canal clearance did not differ between the two groups, but it was continuous until the last evaluation in Group B. The final Gardner angle loss of correction averaged 2 degrees and 5 degrees for Group A and Group B, respectively. The posttraumatic Gardner deformity did not significantly improve by SSTF at the final evaluation in the spines of Group B. Gardner angle correlated significantly with SCE in Group B and Group A in all three periods and in the last evaluation, respectively. Frankel grade did not correlate with loss of correction of AVBHr and PVBHr in Group A, while it significantly correlated with loss of PVBHr correction and SCE in the patients of Group B. There was no neurologic deterioration after surgery in any patient. VAS and SF-36 scores did not significantly correlate with the loss of kyphotic angle correction and AVBHr, PVBHr at the final observation in any patient of both groups.
Conclusions: 
SSTF offered similar significant short-term correction of posttraumatic deformities associated with mid-lumbar A3-burst fractures, but better clinical results as compared to combined surgery. However, SSTF did not significantly maintain the after surgery achieved correction of local posttraumatic kyphosis at the final evaluation.

Methods: 
From May 1995 to March 2001, a consecutive series of subjects with acute isolated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) without neurologic deficit were randomized to receive either an anterior fusion with instrumentation or a posterior fusion with instrumentation. Radiographs including computed tomography (CT) were obtained. Radiographs were repeated at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months. The CT scan was also repeated at 24 months.

To our knowledge, a prospective, randomized study comparing operative and nonoperative treatment of a thoracolumbar burst fracture in patients without a neurological deficit has never been performed. Our hypothesis was that operative treatment would lead to superior long-term clinical outcomes.
Methods: 
From 1994 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients (thirty-two men and fifteen women) with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative (posterior or anterior arthrodesis and instrumentation) or nonoperative treatment (application of a body cast or orthosis). Radiographs and computed tomography scans were analyzed for sagittal alignment and canal compromise. All patients completed a questionnaire to assess any disability they may have had before the injury, and they indicated the degree of pain at the time of presentation with use of a visual analog scale. The average duration of follow-up was forty-four months (minimum, twenty-four months). After treatment, patients indicated the degree of pain with use of the visual analog scale and they completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry back-pain questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey.
Results: 
In the operative group (twenty-four patients), the average fracture kyphosis was 10.1 degrees at the time of admission and 13 degrees at the final follow-up evaluation. The average canal compromise was 39% on admission, and it improved to 22% at the final follow-up examination. In the nonoperative group (twenty-three patients), the average kyphosis was 11.3 degrees at the time of admission and 13.8 degrees at the final follow-up examination after treatment. The average canal compromise was 34% at the time of admission and improved to 19% at the final follow-up examination. On the basis of the numbers available, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to return to work. The average pain scores at the time of the latest follow-up were similar for both groups. The preinjury scores were similar for both groups; however, at the time of the final follow-up, those who were treated nonoperatively reported less disability. Final scores on the SF-36 and Oswestry questionnaires were similar for the two groups, although certain trends favored those treated without surgery. Complications were more frequent in the operative group.
Conclusion: 
We found that operative treatment of patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and normal findings on the neurological examination provided no major long-term advantage compared with nonoperative treatment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Patients were alternately treated by posterior distraction using pedicle instrumentation (AO fixateur interne) or anterior decompression and instrumentation (Kostuik-Harrington device).

This measured 44.5% in those patients undergoing posterior surgery and 58% in those patients undergoing anterior surgery. Postoperatively, this was reduced to 16.5% and 4%, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference between these two groups (P less than 0.0001). The mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 18.7 degrees in those patients treated by anterior surgery and 18.2 degrees in the group treated by posterior surgery.

There is no statistically significant difference between these two groups. There were two implant failures of the anterior Kostuik-Harrington construct and two implant failures of the AO fixateur interne. Blood loss was significantly higher in the patients undergoing anterior surgery, but there were no complications from thoracotomy and anterior decompression of the dural sac.

The main aims of managing thoracolumbar fractures involve stabilization of traumatized regions, to promote vertebral healing or segmental fusion. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation has evolved as an alternative approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, aiming to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare outcomes of percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Relevant articles were identified from six electronic databases from their inception to December 2014.
Results: 
From 12 relevant studies identified, 279 patients undergoing percutaneous fixation were compared with 340 open fixation procedures. Operative duration was significantly shorter in the percutaneous group by 19 min (P = 0.0002). The percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter hospital stay by 5.7 days (P = 0.0007). Whilst there was no difference in screw malpositioning (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33, 1.83; P = 0.56), the percutaneous approach had lower rates of infections (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13, 1.00; P = 0.05), and superior visual analogue scale clinical outcomes (P = 0.001). No difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative Cobb angle (P = 0.22), postoperative body angle (P = 0.66), and postoperative anterior body height (P = 0.19).
Conclusions: 
The percutaneous approach was associated with shorter operative duration and hospital stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss and reduced infection rates. Given the lack of robust clinical evidence, these findings warrant verification in large prospective registries and randomized trials."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Spine fractures are common. The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial but surgery involving pedicle screw fixation has become a popular option.
Objectives: 
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of pedicle screw fixation for traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 11), the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM Database) (1978 to March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (March 2011), reference lists of articles and conference proceedings.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing pedicle screw fixation and other methods of surgical treatment, or different methods of pedicle screw fixation, for treating traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Data collection and analysis: 
Three review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Limited meta-analysis was performed.
Main results: 
Pedicle screw fixation versus other methods of surgery that do not involve pedicle screw fixation was not looked at in any of the identified trials. Studies that were identified investigated different methods of pedicle fixation.Five randomised and three quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. All were at high or unclear risk of various biases, including selection, performance and detection bias. A total of 448 patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures were included in the review. Participants were restricted to individuals without neurological impairment in five trials. The mean ages of study populations of the eight trials ranged from 33 to 41 years, and participants had generally experienced traumatic injury. Mean follow-up for trial participants in the eight trials ranged from 28 to 72 months.Five comparisons were tested.Two trials compared short-segment instrumentation versus long-segment instrumentation. These studies found no significant differences between the two groups in self-reported function and quality of life at final follow-up. Aside from one participant, who sustained partial neurological deterioration that was resolved by further surgery (group not known), no neurological deterioration was noted in these trials.One trial comparing short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular bone grafting versus short-segment fixation alone found no significant difference between the two groups related to patient-perceived function and pain at final follow-up. All participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.Two trials compared posterior instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation ('including' group) versus posterior instrumentation alone ('bridging' group). Investigators reported no differences between the two groups in patient-reported function, quality of life, or pain at final follow-up. One trial confirmed that all participants had normal findings on neurological examination at final follow-up.One trial comparing monosegmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation found no significant differences between the two groups in Oswestry Disability Index results or in pain scores at final follow-up. No neurological deterioration was reported.Three trials compared posterior instrumentation with fusion versus posterior instrumentation without fusion. Researchers found no differences between the two groups in function and quality of life or pain. No participants showed a decline in neurological status in any of the three trials, and no significant difference was reported between groups in the numbers whose status had improved at final follow-up. Two trials stated that patients in the fusion group frequently had donor site pain. Other reported complications included deep vein thrombosis and superficial infection.
Authors' conclusions: 
This review included only eight small trials and five different comparisons of methods of pedicle fixation in various participants while looking at a variety of outcomes at different time points. Overall, evidence is insufficient to inform the selection of different methods of pedicle screw fixation or the combined use of fusion. However, in the absence of robust evidence to support fusion, it is important to factor the risk of long-term donor site pain related to bone harvesting into the decision of whether to use this intervention. Further research involving high-quality randomised trials is needed."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Since introduction of the pedicle screw-rod system, short-segment pedicle screw fixation has been widely adopted for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF). Recently, the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been introduced in spinal surgery; and it has become a popularly used method for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease. However, there are few clinical reports concerning the efficacy of PPSF without fusion in treatment of TLBF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of short-segment PPSF without fusion in comparison to open short-segment pedicle screw fixation with bony fusion in treatment of TLBF.
Methods: 
This study included 59 patients, who underwent either percutaneous (n = 32) or open (n = 27) short-segment pedicle screw fixation for stabilization of TLBF between December 2003 and October 2009. Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were assessed on a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph. For patient's pain and functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Frankel grading system, and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) were measured. Operation time, and the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss were also evaluated.
Findings: 
In both groups, regional kyphosis (Cobb angle) showed significant improvement immediately after surgery, which was maintained until the last follow up, compared with preoperative regional kyphosis. Postoperative correction loss showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. In the percutaneous surgery group, there were significant declines of intraoperative blood loss, and operation time compared with the open surgery group. Clinical results showed that the percutaneous surgery group had a lower VAS score and a better LBOS at three months and six months after surgery; however, the outcomes were similar in the last follow-up.
Conclusions: 
Both open and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation were safe and effective for treatment of TLBF. Although both groups showed favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes at the final follow-up, PPSF without bone graft provided earlier pain relief and functional improvement, compared with open TPSF with posterolateral bony fusion. Despite several shortcomings in this study, the result suggests that ongoing use of PPSF is recommended for the treatment of TLBF."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ?"

To compare the clinical results between computer assisted minimally invasive spine surgery (CAMISS) and traditional open fixation surgery which used in thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients who had undergone surgery for thoracolumbar fracture from January 2006 to March 2011 was performed. The patients were randomly divided into CAMISS group and traditional open treatment group (control group) by random number table. Clinical results were assessed by comparing the following parameters between patients who had undergone CAMISS or traditional open surgery: operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) of the low back pain, the accuracy of pedicle screw, the status and the correction of kyphosis.
Results: 
Forty-seven patients underwent CAMISS, and fifty patients underwent traditional open surgery. The follow-up periods were 3 - 50 months (mean 12 months). According to the preoperative data, the two groups did not differ with respect to age, gender, marriage, occupation, mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, preoperative VAS scores of the low back pain, preoperative functional spine unit (FSU) Cobb's angle and preoperative local angle of the fracture vertebral body (P > 0.05). Compare to the control group, the patients who got CAMISS had more accuracy of pedicle screw, less blood loss, short immobilized time, lower postoperative fever, and better VAS score of the low back pain (t = 2.162 - 8.736, P < 0.05). The improvement of FSU Cobb's angle and local angle of the fracture vertebral body were better at control group after operation (13.8° ± 6.8° vs. 10.9° ± 5.5°, 11.0° ± 6.0° vs. 7.7° ± 4.8°, t = 2.108 and 2.610, P < 0.05).

The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding the classification systems and surgical management of thoracolumbar spine trauma.
Methods: 
A Pubmed search of ""thoracolumbar"", ""spine"", ""fracture"" was used on January 05, 2013. Exclusionary criteria included non-Human studies, case reports, and non-clinical papers. RESULTS. One thousand five hundred twenty manuscripts were initially returned for the combined search string; 150 were carefully reviewed, and 48 manuscripts were included in the review.
Discussion: 
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a high prevalence in North America. The thoracolumbar junction is a point of high kinetic energy transfer and often results in thoracolumbar fractures. New classification systems for thoracolumbar spine fractures are being developed in an attempt to standardize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as well as reporting in the literature. Earlier classifications such as the Denis ""3-column model"" emphasized anatomic divisions to guide surgical planning. More modern classification systems such as the Thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) emphasize initial neurologic status and structural integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex as a guide for surgical decision making and have demonstrated a high intra- and interobserver reliability. Other systems such as the Load-Sharing Classification aid as a useful tool in planning the extent of instrumentation and fusion.
Conclusion: 
There is still much controversy over the surgical management of various thoracolumbar fractures. Level I data exists supporting the nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic compromise. However, for the majority of fracture types in this region, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish standards of care."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Operative treatment of vertebral fractures is focused on stabilization of the spine and decompression of the spinal cord and nerves. In German-speaking countries, it is common to restore the sagittal profile by fracture reduction. The use of percutaneous systems has been limited due to inferior reduction possibilities compared to open systems. The improved reduction options offered by newer percutaneous systems extend their application to highly deformed fractures.
Indications: 
Unstable thoracic, lumbar and lumbosacral spine fractures; unacceptable spinal deformities.
Contraindications: 
Need for open decompression or cross-bracing; relative contraindication: obesity or cachexia.
Surgical technique: 
3 cm skin incision 1.5 cm lateral to the radiological border of the pedicle. Incision of the fascia and blunt preparation to the facet joints. Guidewire placement via fluoroscopy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of three different surgical procedures in the treatment of type A thoracolumbar fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Between September 2012 and January 2015, a total of 90 patients with type A thoracolumbar fractures were randomly assigned into three groups of 30 each. Patients in group A, B, and C were treated with three-level percutaneous fixation, two-level percutaneous fixation, and three-level open fixation, respectively. Blood loss, duration of surgery, VAS scores, Cobb angles, and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were collected for statistical analysis.
Results: 
The average follow-up was 17.7 months. Post-operative Cobb angles were significantly corrected and anterior height ratios of fractured vertebrae were well restored in all three groups (p < 0.01). Back pain was efficiently relieved according to VAS score change (p < 0.01).

To compare the clinical effect of thoracolumbar fractures between single-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the gap of paravertebral muscles and double-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the stripping of paravertebral muscles.
Methods: 
From September 2008 to January 2010, 65 patients with incomplete compressed thoracolumbar fractures or burst thoracolumbar fractures with unilateral endplate injury were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty patients were treated with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paravertebral muscles (treatment group). Thirty-five patients were treated with double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of the paravertebral muscles (control group). All the internal fixations were taken out during 10-12 months after operation. Operative time, perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume were compared between two groups. At final follow-up, the change of neurological ASIA grade were recorded; and postoperative 5 days and final follow-up, compared Denis classification of lumbar and back pain between two groups; and analyzed the sagittal index and compressibility of anterior border of vertebral body by X -ray lateral projection.
Results: 
All patients were follow-up from 14 to 22 months with an average of 18.3 months. No postoperative infection, secondary spinal cord injury was found. One case of control group occurred internal fixation breakage at the 11th month after operation and other internal fixation no loosening. There was no significant difference in operative time, the recovery of neurological function between the two groups (P > 0.05). Perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume of treatment group was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). And in Denis classification of lumbar and back pain, the treatment group recovered more quickly, and the residual pain of lumbar and back was less than that of control group (P < 0.01). Postoperative posterior salient and compression of anterior border of vertebral body improved in two groups (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in degree of improvement between two groups (P > 0.05); but both loss existed at final follow-up (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in loss of posterior salient between two groups (P > 0.05). In the treatment group, the loss of rectify of anterior border of vertebral body existed, but it was less than that of the control group.
Conclusion: 
In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications, the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paraspinal muscles, can effectively recover the height of vertebral body and rectify posterior salient, and reduce the fixed segment. Compared with the traditional operative method of double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of paraspinal muscle, it can obviously reduce the operation wound and the bleeding, lessen the pain of lumbar and back. And the recent clinical effect is satisfied."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The management of amyelic thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). Twenty-three patients were treated with PKP, and 25 patients with SSPI. They all presented with Type A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at two years follow-up. Radiographic data including the anterior and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle, as well as spinal canal compromise was also evaluated. The patients in both groups were similar regarding age, bone mineral density (BMD), follow-up period, severity of the deformity and fracture. Blood loss, operation time, and bed-rest time were less in the PKP group. VAS, ODI score improved more rapidly after surgery in the PKP group. No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at final follow-up (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha), the height of posterior vertebrae (Hp) and the kyphosis angle showed significant improvement in each group (p < 0.05). The postoperative improvement in spinal canal compromise was not statistically significant in the PKP group (p > 0.05); there was a significant improvement in the SSPI group (p < 0.05). Moreover, these postoperative radiographic assessments showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the improvement of canal compromise (p < 0.05). At final follow-up, remodeling of spinal canal compromise was detected in both groups.
Conclusion: 
Both PKP and SSPI appeared as effective and reliable operative techniques for selected amyelic thoracolumbar fractures in the short-term. PKP had a significantly smaller blood loss and shorter bed-rest time, but SSPI provided a better reduction. Long-time studies should be conducted to support these clinical outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Some studies have reported that the conventional intersegmental pedicle screws (4-screw fixation [4S]) device for thoracolumbar fractures was associated with inadequate reduction of fractured vertebrae, insufficient correction of kyphosis, and implant failure. Recently, a series of biomechanical studies has confirmed that the addition of intermediate fixation screws (6-screw fixation [6S]) could provide stronger fixation and better reduction of fractured vertebrae. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiologic efficacy of the additional intermediate screws remains unclear.
Methods: 
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was used to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes and complications of posterior pedicle screws combined with intermediate screws fixation versus conventional intersegmental pedicle screw fixation. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE, OVID, and Springer according to a search strategy, selecting articles based on inclusion criteria, and extracted data from these reports. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed. Pooled estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: 
Six randomized controlled trials involving 310 patients were evaluated in this meta-analysis. Pooled estimates showed statistically similar baseline characteristics, hospital stays, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and infection rates between the 4S group and the 6S group. The 6S group had significantly less correction loss of segmental angle and of anterior vertebral height compression, and lower implant failure rate. The 6S group also showed a slightly longer operative time and more blood loss than did the 4S group.
Conclusions: 
Based on our analysis, the combined intermediate screws fixation technique was associated with significantly improved radiologic outcomes but did not seem to compromise other perioperative outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

To investigate the effect of fusion on short segment including fractured level (SSIFL) and long segment (LS) transpedicular fixation after acute thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. The 2-year clinical and radiologic follow-up results of the 2 groups also were compared.
Methods: 
Seventy-four patients were randomized into one of 2 groups: SSIFL (n = 39) or LS (n = 35). The SSIFL group included one level above and one level below, including the fracture level, whereas the LS group included 2 levels above and 2 levels below, excluding the fracture level, for the transpedicular fixation. Fusion was assessed by technetium 99m-methylendiphosphonate, bone scintigraphy, and single-photon emission computed tomography.

The clinical scores and radiologic parameters of patients with and without fusion also were compared.
Results: 
The number of patients with fusion was significantly greater in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group. There was a significant reduction of the clinical scores of patients who had fusion compared with the fusion-free group; however, there was no radiologically significant difference. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the SSIFL and LS groups in terms of the 2-year radiologic and clinical follow-up results.

Controversy regarding the best treatment for this condition remains. The traditional surgical approach, when indicated, involves spinal fixation and arthrodesis. Newer studies have brought the need for fusion associated with internal fixation into question. Not performing arthrodesis could reduce surgical time and intraoperative bleeding without affecting clinical and radiological outcomes. With this study, the authors aimed to assess the effect of fusion, adjuvant to internal fixation, on surgically treated thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS A search of the Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed to identify randomized trials that compared the use and nonuse of arthrodesis in association with internal fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The search encompassed all data in these databases up to February 28, 2016. RESULTS Five randomized/quasi-randomized trials, which involved a total of 220 patients and an average follow-up time of 69.1 months, were included in this review. No significant difference between groups in the final scores of the visual analog pain scale or Low Back Outcome Scale was detected. Surgical time and blood loss were significantly lower in the group of patients who did not undergo fusion (p < 0.05). Among the evaluated radiological outcomes, greater mobility in the affected segment was found in the group of those who did not undergo fusion. No significant difference between groups in the degree of kyphosis correction, loss of kyphosis correction, or final angle of kyphosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS The data reviewed in this study suggest that the use of arthrodesis did not improve clinical outcomes, but it was associated with increased surgical time and higher intraoperative bleeding and did not promote significant improvement in radiological parameters."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety between patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who underwent posterior fixation alone (non-fusion) and supplemented with fusion.
Methods: 
A comprehensive search of related literature was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library. Clinical outcomes (LBOS and VAS), surgical outcomes (operation time, blood loss, hospital stay and perioperative complications), and radiographic outcomes (kyphotic angle, decreased vertebral body height and segmental motion) were assessed in the meta-analysis.

However, there was a significant difference regarding blood loss, operation time, segmental motion and donor site pain between fusion and non-fusion.
Conclusion: 
This meta-analysis demonstrated that posterior fixation alone could achieve satisfactory clinical and radiological results in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture. Moreover, posterior fixation without fusion was superior to additional fusion with less blood loss, shorter operation time, better segmental motion and lower donor site pain."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Thoracolumbar burst fractures (TBFs) are often followed by bilateral pedicle screw fixation (BPSF) at the level of fracture using posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). There has been increasing support for unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) in an attempt to reduce complications and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic results of UPSF versus BPSF at the level of fracture using SSPI in the treatment of severe TBFs.
Methods: 
The records of 42 consecutive patients with severe TBFs who underwent SSPI were divided into 2 groups according to the number of screws in the fracture level, including 20 patients (five screws) in UPSF group and 22 patients (six screws) in BPSF. Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded before surgery, after surgery, and 1.5 years after operation. The patients'clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). For radiological evaluation, changes in local kyphosis angle (LKA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH) were investigated using plain radiographs.
Results: 
Mean follow-up was 18.3 months for UPSF group and 19.0 months for BPSF group (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the age, gender, fracture type and site in both groups. Radiologically, no statistically difference was observed between the two groups in corrected rate of LKA, VWA, or AVH(all P > 0.05). With respect to clinical variants including VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the UPSF group seemed to have advantages over BPSF group in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, hospitalization time (P > 0.05). Especially, implant cost for the BPSF group was 22% greater than the UPSF group. No serious complications occurred in our study. In all cases, fusions healed well and no revision surgery was performed for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation during follow-up.
Conclusions: 
The present study is the first to demonstrate that patients undergoing SSPI with UPSF as compared with BPSF for the treatment of severe TBFs had similar clinical and radiologic outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: РИ?"

The surgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures frequently involves posterior pedicle screw fixation. However, the application of short- or long-segment instrumentation is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of the short-segment fixation with inclusion of the fracture level (SSFIFL) versus the traditional long-segment fixation (LSF) for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures.
Methods: 
From December 2009 to February 2014, 60 patients with unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures (T11-L2) were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group 1 included 30 patients treated by SSFIFL (six-screw construct including the fracture level). Group 2 included 30 patients treated by LSF (eight-screw construct excluding the fracture level). Local kyphosis angle (LKA), anterior body height (ABH), posterior body height (PBH), ABH/PBH ratio of fractured vertebra, and Asia Scale Impairment Scale were evaluated.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in regard to age, sex, trauma etiology, fracture level, fracture type, neurologic status, pre-operative LKA, ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio and follow-up (p > 0.05). Reduction of post-traumatic kyphosis (assessed with LKA) and restoration of fracture-induced wedge shape of the vertebral body (assessed with ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio) at post-operative period were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.234; p = 0.754). There was no significant difference between the two groups in term of correction loss at the last follow-up too (LKA was 15.97° ± 5.62° for SSFIFL and 17.76° ± 11.22° for LSF [p = 0.427]). Neurological outcome was similar in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Inclusion of fracture level in a short-segment fixation for a thoracolumbar junction fractures results in a kyphosis correction and in a maintenance of the sagittal alignment similar to a long-segment instrumentation.

Short-segment U-shaped pedicle screw fixation has been widely used to treat thoracolumbar burst fracture. Some studies have reported the disadvantages of traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, which included a relatively high rate of adjacent segment degeneration and screw failure, including screw pullout and breakage. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of open reduction and fixation using KumaFix fixation system in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
From June 2011 to June 2012, 45 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with KumaFix (the treatment group, n = 23) or traditional U-shaped pedicle screw (the control group, n = 22). The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiologic and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb angle and vertebral wedge angle. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Questionnaire.
Results: 
All patients were followed up from 9 to 22 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The operation time in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Preoperative Cobb angles and vertebral wedge angles in two groups were significantly decreased after surgery, and these have been well maintained at the last follow-up with mild correction losses. The results of clinical outcome showed lower VAS and ODI scores in two groups compared with those preoperative, and the treatment group had greater improvement on the ODI compared with the control group at the last follow-up.
Conclusions:

The main aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after stabilization by a percutaneous transpedicular system and stabilization from the standard open approach for thoracolumbar spine injury.
Methods: 
Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in the study over a period of 16 months. Patients were included in the study if they experienced 1 thoracolumbar fracture (A3.1-A3.3, according to the AO/Magerl classification), had an absence of neurological deficits, had no other significant injuries, and were willing to participate. Eighteen patients were treated by short-segment, minimally invasive, percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. The control group was composed of 19 patients who were stabilized using a short-segment transpedicular construct, which was performed through a standard midline incision. The pain profile was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS), and overall satisfaction by a simple 4-stage scale relating to performance of daily activities. Working ability and return to original occupation were also monitored. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), vertebral body angle (VBA), and bisegmental Cobb angle. The accuracy of screw placement was examined using CT.
Results: 
The mean surgical duration in the percutaneous screw group was 53 ± 10 minutes, compared with 60 ± 9 minutes in the control group (p = 0.032). The percutaneous screw group had a significantly lower perioperative blood loss of 56 ± 17 ml, compared with 331 ± 149 ml in the control group (p < 0.001). Scores on the VAS in patients in the percutaneous screw group during the first 7 postoperative days were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in VBI, VBA, and Cobb angle values during follow-up. There was no significant difference in screw placement accuracy between the groups and no patients required surgical revision. There was no significant difference between groups in overall satisfaction at the 2-year follow-up (p = 0.402). Working ability was insignificantly better in the percutaneous screw group; previous working position was achieved in 17 patients in this group and in 12 cases in the control group (p = 0.088).
Conclusions: 
This study confirms that the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique represents a viable option in the treatment of preselected thoracolumbar fractures. A significant reduction in blood loss, postoperative pain, and surgical time were the main advantages associated with this minimally invasive technique. Clinical, functional, and radiological results were at least the same as those achieved using the open technique after a 2-year follow-up.

To evaluate the efficacies of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra plus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.
Methods: 
Between June 2008 and September 2010, a total of 46 patients with fractures of thoracolumbar junction, whose scores of load sharing classification (LSC) ranging from 5 to 7, underwent the combined treatment of SSPI and fracture level pedicle screw at our department. They were divided into 2 groups. Group I included 25 patients undergoing SSPI plus unilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (5 screws) while Group II included 21 patients had SSPI plus bilateral pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra (6 screws). The data of anterior body height compression (AVHC), sagittal Cobb's angle, internal fixation failure, restoration of nervous function, visual analogue score (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were analyzed.
Results: 
The groups were similar with regards to age, gender, LSC, AVHC and sagittal Cobb's angle preoperatively. Blood loss volume and operative duration were less in the Group I (109.2 ± 30.68 vs 110.0 ± 32.06 min, t = -0.086, P > 0.05 and 376.0 ± 303.1 vs 409.5 ± 361.1 ml, t = -0.342, P > 0.05). They were followed up for a minimum period of 12 months. In follow-up period was 17.48 ± 4.14 months in Group I versus 18.33 ± 4.31 months in Group II (t = -0.683, P > 0.05). All patients with initial partial neurologic deficits improved at the final follow-up. Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups.
Conclusions: 
Pedicle screw fixation through the pedicle of fractured vertebra plus SSPI is an excellent surgical therapeutic choice for patients with a LSC range of 5-7 thoraclumbar fractures.

To investigate the clinical outcome of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws through paraspinal muscle sparing approach to treat thoracolumbar fractures, and to discuss its advantages.
Methods: 
From August 2010 to June 2012, we had 40 thoracolumber fractures patients (27 males and 13 females). Their ages ranged from 22 to 60 years. Of the 40 cases, 4 were T11 fractures, 13 T12 fractures ,17 L1 fractures,6 L2 fractures. According to Denis classification,all of them were burst fractures, with vertebral canal compromise less than 1/3. According to AO classification they were type A or type B1 injuries. All the cases had no nerve injury. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. With Group A (20 cases) we took the method of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to fix one level above and below the injured vertebra through the parespinal muscle sparing approach. With Group B (20 cases), we took the traditional posterior midline approach and open procedure. Then we compared the two groups by operation time, blood loss, drainage, Visual Analogue Scales and X-ray exposure.
Results: 
Minimal invasive group had obvious advatages in operation time, bleeding control and early pain relief of post-operation. The X-ray exposure and long-term follow-up outcome were almost the same.
Conclusion: 
Through paraspinal muscle sparing approach minimal invasive internal fixtation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to treat thoracolumber has more advantages than traditional procedure in blood control and quick recovery. The method needs no special instruments and don't increase X-ray exposure."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Специальные методы"

Flexion-distraction injuries occur due to distractive forces causing disruption of the posterior and middle spinal columns. These fractures classically consist of a fracture line through the posterior bony elements; involvement of the posterior ligamentous complex is, however, common. Surgical treatment is often required for these unstable injuries to avoid neurological deterioration and posttraumatic kyphosis, and the surgery traditionally consists of an open posterior approach with instrumented fusion. Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for these injuries, with the goal of minimal tissue disruption and preservation of normal anatomy while achieving adequate stabilization, has recently been reported in the literature, but to date, a direct comparative study comparing open and percutaneous fixation has not been reported. The authors report their experience treating these fractures with both techniques and review the available literature.
Methods: 
Patients with flexion-distraction injury who were treated between May 2003 and March 2013 were prospectively followed. American Spinal Injury Association scores and degree of kyphotic angulation were recorded at admission, discharge, and follow-up. Data regarding intraoperative blood loss and operative time were obtained from a chart review. Patients treated with open versus minimally invasive procedures were compared.
Results: 
The authors identified 39 patients who suffered flexion-distraction injuries and were treated at their institution during the specified period; one of these patients declined surgery. All had injury to the posterior ligamentous complex. Open surgical procedures with pedicle screw fixation and posterolateral fusion were performed in 27 patients, while 11 patients underwent minimally invasive pedicle screw placement. Overall, there was improvement in kyphotic angulation at the time of discharge as well as most recent follow-up in both the open surgery and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) groups. The authors found no significant difference in American Spinal Injury Association score or the degree of kyphotic angulation between the MIS and open surgery groups. There was a trend toward shorter operative time for the MIS group, and patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures had significantly less blood loss.
Conclusions: 
Minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screw fixation appears to have similar efficacy in the treatment of flexion-distraction injuries and it allows for reduced blood loss and tissue damage compared with open surgical techniques. Therefore it should be considered as an option for the treatment of this type of injury."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006.
Objectives: 
To compare the outcomes of surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles.
Selection criteria: 
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.
Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done.
Main results: 
We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.
Authors' conclusions: 
The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. It is likely, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The optimal timing of stabilization in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. There is currently a lack of consensus on the timing of surgical stabilization, which is limited by the reality that a randomized controlled trial to evaluate early versus late stabilization is difficult to perform. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the benefits, safety and costs of early stabilization compared with late stabilization using data available in the current literature.
Methods: 
An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies evaluating the timing of surgery in patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Two reviewers independently analyzed and selected each study on the basis of the eligibility criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (GRADE). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
Ten studies involving 2,512 subjects were identified. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization shortened the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days and reduced morbidity and hospital expenses for patients with thoracic fractures. However, reduced morbidity and hospital expenses were not observed with stabilization of lumbar fractures. Owing to the very low level of evidence, no conclusion could be made regarding the effect of early stabilization on mortality.
Conclusions: 
We could adhere to the recommendation that patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures should undergo early stabilization, which may reduce the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, morbidity and hospital expenses, particularly when the thoracic spine is involved. Individual patient characteristics should be concerned carefully. However, the definite conclusion cannot be made due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and low level of evidence. Further prospective studies are required to confirm whether there are benefits to early stabilization compared with late stabilization."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

A prospective clinical trial was conducted.
Objective: 
To compare the clinical and radiologic late results of monosegmental transpedicular fixation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures and evaluate the efficacy of monosegmental transpedicular fixation.
Summary of background data: 
SSPI (1 level above and 1 below the fracture level) are accepted by many surgeons as an accepted technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. To preserve more motion segments, some authors have advocated monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI). The recent developments showed that MSPI yielded good clinical results; however, there were no report about comparison of clinical outcome between monosegmental and biosegmental transpedicular fixation in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Methods: 
Eighty-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were randomized by a simple method into 2 groups. Group 1 were treated with monosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 47), and group 2 were treated with biosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 38). Clinical (Low Back Outcome Score and Oswestry Disability Index) and radiologic (load-sharing classification index, sagittal index, and percentage of anterior body height compression) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The 2 groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, local kyphosis, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate between the 2 surgical approaches was also not significantly different (group 1 = 6.38% and group 2 = 5.26%). Oswestry Disability Index improved in both groups by >25 points in a similar amount (P = 0.23). The average follow-up Low Back Outcome Score was 74.9 and 60.2 for group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = 0.033).
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, radiologic parameters demonstrated that both MSPI and SSPI are the effective and reliable operative techniques for selected thoracolumbar burst fractures. MSPI shortened the operative time and decreased the amount of blood loss significantly and, thus, offered better clinical results. Nevertheless, long-term studies are supposed to be performed to support the outcomes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

Systematic Review.
Objective: 
To determine whether early spinal stabilization in thoracolumbar spine trauma decreases morbidity and mortality.
Summary of background data: 
The role of early spinal stabilization through surgical means may have a number of benefits. These include reduced morbidity and mortality because of more rapid mobilization afforded by spinal column stabilization and a reduction in the incidence and severity of sepsis and respiratory failure. There are several potential disadvantages of early surgery. The most strongly debated is the potential that the additional physiologic injury may result in an unintended increase in morbidity and mortality caused by worsening of existing injuries, such as with pulmonary or intracranial trauma. This problem may be compounded by increased hemorrhage and resulting hypotension. Operating in the presence of missed or underestimated associated injuries or under less-than-ideal conditions relative to the complexity of the surgery and resources required is also a potential disadvantage.
Methods: 
A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published between January 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify published studies examining the timing of thoracolumbar fracture fixation. Two independent reviewers assessed the strength of literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, assessing quality, quantity, and consistency of results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results: 
A total of 68 articles were initially screened, and 9 ultimately met the predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated that early stabilization of thoracic fractures reduced the mean number of days on a ventilator, the number of days in intensive care unit and in hospital, and reduced respiratory morbidity compared with late stabilization. This effect, other than the length of hospital stay, was not seen with stabilization of lumbar fractures. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect of the timing of stabilization on mortality in thoracolumbar fractures.
Conclusion: 
Ideally, patients with unstable thoracic fractures should undergo early (<72 hours) stabilization of their injury to reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true, ""lumena27""=>true}"

The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Although spinal fusion has been a touchstone of spinal fixation, nonfusion technique have become raising its popularity recently. Some studies suggested that nonfusion had several advantages over fusion. The aim of this prospective study was to compare long segment posterior instrumentation with fusion versus long-segment posterior instrumentation without fusion.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 42 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation with fusion (WF), whereas Group 2 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation without fusion (WOF). Long segment instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
Measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index and anterior vertebral height compression showed that both group had similar outcome at final follow-up. Moreover, there was no difference between the two groups according to low back outcome score. Also, implant failure rate (4.7%) was quite low in both groups. However, WF group had prolonged operative time, increased blood loss and donor site morbidity.

Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads.

Data collection and analysis: 
Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Pooling of data was not carried out as only one small, poor quality trial was included.
Main results: 
We included one trial comparing operative with non-operative treatment (53 participants).

The degree of kyphosis or the percentage of correction lost did not correlate with any clinical symptoms at the time of the final follow up. Average costs related to hospitalization and treatment in the operative group appeared to be more than in the non-operative group.
Authors' conclusions: 
There was no statistically significant difference on the functional outcome two years or more after therapy between operative and non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit.

However, there are several studies regarding the high rate of failure. The aim of this prospective study was to compare SS versus long-segment (LS) instrumentation.
Methods: 
For this purpose, 18 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included nine patients treated by SS pedicle fixation, whereas group 2 included nine patients treated by LS instrumentation. SS instrumentation was pedicle fixation one level above and below the fractured vertebra. LS instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra.
Results: 
As a result, measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index, and anterior vertebral height compression showed that the LS group had a better outcome at final follow-up (P < 0.05). Also, the SS group had a 55% failure rate, whereas the LS group had prolonged operative time and increased blood loss. However, there was no difference between the two groups according to Low Back Outcome Score.
Conclusions: 
In conclusion, radiographic parameters demonstrated that LS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Nevertheless, clinical outcome was the same between the two groups. However, our conclusions were based on posterior-only surgery. Anterior column support would negate the need for LS fixation. Also, SS would have been more successful if two above and two below pedicle screws were used."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

A systematic review of the literature, pertaining surgical treatment of traumatic thoracic and lumbar spine fractures, was performed.
Objectives: 
To provide information on surgical techniques for traumatic spine fracture management, their respective performance and complication rates, based on previously published information.
Summary of background data: 
The treatment of traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine remains controversial. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to choose between the various surgical options. In absence of conclusive studies, a systematic review can be an alternative to obtain more convincing information.
Methods: 
Full-text papers from 1970 until 2001 were included if strict inclusion criteria were met. Five surgical subgroups were recognized: posterior short-segment (PS), posterior long-segment (PL), reports on both posterior short- and long-segment (PSL), anterior (A), and anterior combined with posterior (AP) techniques. Clearly defined and generally accepted parameters were scored and subsequently analyzed. The preoperative injury severity of the surgical groups was compared. The neurologic, radiologic, and functional outcome and complications of all groups were assessed.
Results: 
A total of 132 papers, the majority being retrospective case-series, were included representing 5,748 patients. The preoperative injury severity revealed an inequality between the subgroups. Partial neurologic deficits had the potential to resolve irrespective of treatment choice. None of the five techniques used was able to maintain the corrected kyphosis angle. The functional outcome after surgery seems to be better than generally believed. Complications are relatively rare.
Conclusions: 
In general, surgical treatment of traumatic spine fractures is safe and effective. Surgical techniques can only be compared using randomized controlled trials."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

Transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in combination with short-segment instrumentation has been offered as an alternative to prevent failure. However, concern still remains about the potential complication of further canal narrowing or failure of remodeling with this technique. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the effect of transpedicular intracorporeal grafting on spinal canal restoration and remodeling in a group of patients treated with short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-one patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomised into transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n=11) and non-transpedicular grafting (NTPG) (n=10) groups, and were prospectively followed for an average of 50 months (range 25-85 months). Groups were similar in age, type of fracture, load sharing classification and kyphotic deformity. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomographic (CT) images through the level of pedicles were obtained, corrected for differences in magnification, and digitized. Areas of the spinal canals were measured and normalized by the estimated area at that level (average of adjacent levels). Average kyphosis was 19.7 degrees+/-6.2 degrees at presentation, was corrected to 1.9 degrees+/-4.9 degrees by operation, but was found to have deteriorated to 9.1 degrees+/-6.4 degrees at final follow-up. There were no differences between groups regarding the evolution of sagittal deformity. Spinal canal narrowing was 38.5+/-18.2% at presentation, 22.1+/-19.8% postoperatively, and it further improved to -2.5+/-16.7% at follow-up, similar for both groups. Our results demonstrate that transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in the treatment of burst fractures does not have a detectable effect on the rate of reconstruction of the canal area or on remodeling. Spinal canal remodeling was observed to occur in all patients regardless of grafting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

A prospective, randomized study comparing two treatment methods for thoracolumbar burst fractures: short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting and the same procedure without transpedicular grafting.
Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of transpedicular grafting in preventing failure of short-segment fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
Summary of background data: 
Short-segment pedicle instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures is known to fail early because of the absence of anterior support. Additional transpedicular grafting has been offered as an alternative to prevent this failure. However, there is controversy about the results of transpedicular grafting.
Methods: 
Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in the study. The inclusion criterion was the presence of fractures through the T11-L3 vertebrae without neurologic compromise. The patients were randomized by a simple method into two groups. Group 1 patients were treated using short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n = 10), and Group 2 patients were treated by short-segment fixation alone (NTPG) (n = 10). Clinical (Likert's questionnaire) and radiologic (sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and local kyphosis) outcomes were analyzed.
Results: 
The two groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in local kyphosis and/or screw breakage, was also not significantly different (TPG = 50%, NTPG = 40%, P = 0.99).
Conclusions: 
Short-segment transpedicular instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures is associated with a high rate of failure that cannot be decreased by additional transpedicular intracorporeal grafting."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"

Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively. According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program. All fractures in the conservative group were of type A. At follow-up of all operated cases, the local gibbus angle had improved by a reduction of on average 18.6 degrees and was followed by a loss of correction of 12.5 degrees ending in a final gain of 6.1 degrees at follow-up. At follow-up of the conservatively treated cases, the local gibbus angle showed an improvement of 11.1 degrees at reduction and a loss of correction of 14.9 degrees after reduction. The remaining result was -3.6 degrees, that means an increase of kyphoses compared to the x-ray at admission. In order to be able to compare two homogeneous groups only fractures of type A were used. Comparison of the two groups showed an improvement of the vertebral body angle of 70% (11.3 degrees) after reduction in the surgical group and 46% (6.1 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The subsequent loss of correction was 19% (3 degrees) in the surgical and 34% (4.5 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The remaining gain at follow-up was 51% (8.3 degrees) in the surgical and only 12% (1.6 degrees) in the conservative group. The local gibbus angle had improved on average by 17.1 degrees after reduction in the surgical and by 11.1 degrees in the conservatively treated group. Loss of correction was 71% (12.2 degrees) and 132% (14.9 degrees), respectively. The final result at follow-up showed a decrease of kyphosis of 4.9 degrees in the surgical and an increase of kyphosis of 3.7 degrees in the conservatively treated group. The difference was significant. Within the surgical group, 75% of the loss of correction was caused by the discs and 25% by the vertebral body. In the conservatively treated group it was 69% and 31%, respectively. Concerning loss of correction, no difference was seen between patients with and without intercorporal bone grafting. There was no relationship between radiological and clinical outcome. Whereas 15% of the patients of the surgical group were not satisfied or moderately satisfied with the result, all patients in the conservatively treated group were satisfied or very satisfied. Based on the good clinical results of the conservative treatment we can conclude that in stable fractures without severe deformity, and in patients who are in bad general condition, conservative treatment can considered as an alternative to surgical treatment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Pavel""=>true, ""dursunov.eldar97""=>true}"
