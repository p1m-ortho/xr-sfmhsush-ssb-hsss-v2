abstract = {SUMMARY: To evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, we compared the pre- and postoperative clinical and radiological results in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. We compared the pre- and postoperative compression ratios (CRs), kyphotic angles (KAs), and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the patients in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The results showed that the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is a therapeutic option for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Due to the relatively high-risk nature of the patient population, complications such as myocardial events, seizures, agitation, or dyspnea may occur and render completion of the procedure imprudent. We analyzed the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients who underwent balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs between January 2005 and April 2008. A unipedicular approach was used in 15 patients and a bipedicular approach was used in 30 patients. The CR, KA, and 100-point VAS score for pain were measured pre- and postoperatively in each patient. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in restoration of the CR (p = 0.376) and KA (p = 0.888) between the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The patients in the unipedicular group showed greater improvement in VAS score than those in the bipedicular group (p {\textless} 0.001). There were no postoperative complications, such as nerve injury or pedicle fracture, in either of the two groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs were as good as those of bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. Thus, unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with VCFs.},

Trauma of the thoracolumbar spine is frequently associated with spinal cord injury and other visceral and bony injuries. Prolonged pain and disability after thoracolumbar trauma present a significant burden on patients and society.To formulate evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the care of patients with injuries to the thoracolumbar spine.A systematic review of the literature was performed using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for studies relevant to thoracolumbar spinal injuries based on specific clinically oriented questions. Relevant publications were selected for review.For all of the questions posed, the literature search yielded a total of 6561 abstracts. The task force selected 804 articles for full text review, and 78 were selected for inclusion in this overall systematic review.The available evidence for the evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracolumbar spine injuries demonstrates considerable heterogeneity and highly variable degrees of quality. However, the workgroup was able to formulate a number of key recommendations to guide clinical practice. Further research is needed to counter the relative paucity of evidence that specifically pertains to patients with only thoracolumbar spine injuries.The full version of the guideline can be reviewed at: https://www.cns.org/guideline-chapters/congress-neurological-surgeons-systematic-review-evidence-based-guidelines/chapter{\_}1.},

abstract = {Surgical therapy is vital for thoracolumbar burst fracture in restoring vertebral height, correcting kyphosis, decompressing nervous, and maintaining stability. Patients have unexpectedly lower hemoglobin levels postoperatively, which is remarkably inconsistent with the measured blood loss. However, hidden blood loss (HBL) is often neglected.To investigate HBL during perioperative period and determine its influential factors after surgery.A total of 68 patients who underwent surgery in our institution between January 2015 and January 2017 were included in the study. The demographic information, including the patients' age, gender, weight, height, duration of symptoms, surgery approach, time of operation, volume of drainage, classification of fracture, percentage of vertebral height loss and restoration, was collected. HBL was calculated according to the Gross formula. Influential factors were further analyzed using multivariate linear regression analysis.The mean HBL was 303.5 (range 18.4-803.5) mL, accounting for 67.5{\%} of total blood loss. It indicated that the amount of HBL was much higher than we expected. Multiple and stepwise regression analysis revealed that blood loss, preoperative activated partial prothrombin time (APPT), percentage of anterior and medium vertebral height restoration were positively correlated with HBL. The association between HBL and the influential factors was analyzed based on the regression model equation: HBL = [1 + e [216.737 + 0.627*blood loss + 10.817*APTT + 207.549*anterior height restoration + 20.002*medium height restoration]]-1.HBL during perioperative period accounted for a substantial portion of the total blood loss and was much larger than what we thought. The blood loss, preoperative APPT, percentage of anterior and medium vertebral height restoration were positively correlated with HBL. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to HBL to ensure patients' safety.},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the clinical and  functional outcomes between combined anterior and posterior 2-segment spinal fusion and posterior 3-segment spinal fusion in patients with thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures without neurological deficit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with TL burst fracture, 20 degrees kyphosis/50{\%} collapse, and posterior ligament injury, but without neurological deficit, were randomly assigned into posterior and combined groups. At the final follow-up, the clinical and functional means of the groups were compared. RESULTS: Fourteen and 13 patients were treated with the combined and posterior approach, respectively. Age (40.0+/-10.3 and 37.0+/-14.2 years; P=.519), sex (female/male, 3:10 and 5:9; P=.385), mechanism of injury (P=.513), fractured levels (P=.185), type of fracture (P=.293), degree of kyphosis at initial admission (P=.616), collapse (P=.155), canal narrowing (P=.280), follow-up (P=.076) and accompanied limb fracture (P=.374) were similar between groups. Duration of hospital stay was similar between groups (P=.102). However, blood loss was was higher in combined group (195ml versus 358ml, P=0.003). A 14.2 degrees correction was achieved in the posterior group and 16.9 degrees in the combined group (P=.61). Loss of correction at the last follow-up visit was 2.1 degrees with a final kyphosis of 7.2 degrees in the posterior group and 1.2 degrees with a final kyphosis of 5.5 degrees in the combined group. The differences in the correction of kyphosis (P=.616), postop kyphosis (P=.756), loss of correction (P=.141) and final kyphosis (P=.085) between the treatment groups were not significant. At the last follow-up visit scores were similar. CONCLUSION: Both treatment methods are similar in terms of clinical and functional outcomes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the type and severity of spinal injury in airborne sports, as well as patients demographics in this unique set of athletes. Paragliding is one of the most popular airborne sports in Switzerland, which thought to be no less dangerous with a high potential for spinal injury. Few studies on spinal column injuries have been performed in these high-risk athletes with only inconsistent findings. METHODS: Patient charts were analyzed for all airborne sports injuries affecting the spine from 2010 to 2017 at a level-1 trauma center in Switzerland. To classify the injuries, we used the newest AOSpine classification, ASIA-grading and the injury severity score (ISS). In total, 235 patients were admitted to the emergency department due to an airborne injury. A total of 148 patients (148/235, 63.0{\%}) which were predominantly male (125/235, 84.5{\%}) at a mean age of 39.4 years suffered 334 spinal fractures and 5 spinal contusions. The mean ISS was 17.3, and the L1 vertebra was most commonly affected (47.6{\%} of cases, 68/148). RESULTS: A total of 78 patients (54.5{\%} or 78/148) required spine surgery due to instability or neurological deficits (31/148 patients; 20.9{\%}). Concomitant injuries were identified in 64.2{\%} of cases (n = 95). CONCLUSION: Due to the increasing popularity of airborne sports, age of patients and severity of injuries (ISS) increased compared with the literature. The thoracolumbal spine is at especially high risk. To prevent further complications, the treatment procedure has to be sought carefully and algorithm should be introduced in clinics to avoid delay in diagnostics and surgery.

abstract = {The cutaneous silent period (CSP) to noxious finger stimulation constitutes a robust spinal inhibitory reflex that protects the hand from injury. In certain conditions, spinal inhibition is interrupted by a brief burst-like electromyographic activity, dividing the CSP into two inhibitory phases (I1 and I2). This excitatory component is termed long-loop reflex (LLR) and is presumed to be transcortical in origin. Efficient defense from environmental threats requires sensorimotor integration between multimodal sensory afferents and planning of defensive movements. In the defensive peripersonal space (DPPS) immediately surrounding the body, we interact with objects and persons with increased alertness. We investigated whether CSP differs when the stimulated hand is in the DPPS of the face compared with a distant position. Furthermore, we investigated the possible role of vision in CSP modulation. Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent CSP testing with the handheld either within 5 cm from the nose (near) or away from the body (far). Recordings were obtained from first dorsal interosseous muscle following index (D2) or little finger (D5) stimulation with varying intensities. A subgroup of subjects underwent CSP recordings in near and far conditions, both with eyes open and with eyes closed. No inhibitory CSP parameter differed between stimulation in near and far conditions. LLRs occurring following D2 stimulation were significantly larger in near than far conditions at all stimulus intensities, irrespective of subjects seeing their hand. Similar to the hand-blink reflex, spinally organized protective reflexes may be modulated by corticospinal facilitatory input when the hand enters the DPPS of the face. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY The present findings demonstrate for the first time that a spinally organized protective reflex, the cutaneous silent period (CSP), may be modulated by top-down corticospinal facilitatory input when the stimulated hand enters the defensive peripersonal space (DPPS) of the face. In particular, the cortically mediated excitatory long-loop reflex, which may interrupt the CSP, is facilitated when the stimulated hand is in the DPPS, irrespective of visual control over the hand. No spinal inhibitory CSP parameter differs significantly in or outside the DPPS.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hyperextension-distraction type injury of the thoracolumbar spine is an  unstable fracture pattern that generally necessitates surgical stabilization by posterior instrumentation. Care must be taken when positioning these patients from supine to prone due to the unstable nature of their injury. The study objectives were (1) to describe a novel modification of the Jackson table turn technique, which may be safer and more effective than the conventional log-roll method and traditional Jackson table technique for positioning patients with hyperextension-distraction injuries of the thoracolumbar spine from supine to prone in the operating room and (2) to present two cases in which this technique was successfully performed. METHODS: Two patients were carefully positioned from supine to prone by our modification of the Jackson table turn technique, which utilizes a Wilson frame sandwiched between two flat-top Jackson frames. Case 1: a 65-year-old female presented status-post motor vehicle collision with a T9-T10 extension-distraction injury, requiring T7-T12 posterior spinal instrumented fusion (PSIF). Case 2: a 72-year-old female presented status-post motor vehicle collision with a T9-T10 extension-distraction injury and an unstable L1 burst fracture, requiring T7-L2 PSIF. RESULTS: Both patients remained hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact throughout positioning and postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is safe and effective for positioning patients with hyperextension-distraction type injuries of the thoracolumbar spine from supine to prone in the operating room and may be superior to conventional methods.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unstable sacral fractures are high-energy injuries and comprise polytrauma. Internal fixation to enable withstanding vertical loads is required to get up early from the bed after an unstable sacral fracture. We developed a new minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedure for unstable pelvic ring fractures and reported it in Japanese in 2010. We presented our minimally invasive surgical technique of crab-shaped fixation for the treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures and report on its short-term outcomes. METHODS: Sixteen patients with unstable pelvic ring fractures (AO types C1, 2, and 3) were treated using crab-shaped fixation. All procedures were performed with the patient in the prone position through 5-cm skin incisions created bilaterally at the level of the posterior superior iliac spine. Four iliac screws were inserted and connected with two rods under the fascia. Percutaneous pedicle screws were inserted at L5 or L4 and connected to the iliac rod using offset connectors. Fracture reduction was then performed. RESULTS: The average surgical time was 158 min (range, 117-230 min), with an intraoperative bleeding volume of 299 ml (range, 80-480 ml). Thirty-three pedicle screws and 64 iliac screws were implanted with no instance of malpositioning or perforation. A surgical site infection developed in 2 of the 16 cases. Both were deep methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, with the removal of the distal implants required in only one of these cases. Bony union was achieved in all patients, and all vertical displacements reduced by 7.0 mm, on average (range, 5.4-9.0 mm), to {\textless} 10 cm. Correction was retained in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Crab-shaped fixation provides a feasible MIS approach for spinopelvic fixation, which allows good reduction of the vertical displacement of unstable pelvic ring fractures and bony union.},

Thirty-eight consecutive patients (nine male, 29 female; mean age: 74.8 years; range: 60-86 years) with burst fractures affecting the middle-low lumbar vertebrae who underwent posterior-instrumented fusion were included. Using the Magerl classification system, these fractures were classified into three types: 16 patients with superior incomplete burst fracture (superior-type), 11 patients with inferior incomplete burst fracture (inferior-type) and 11 patients with complete burst fracture (complete-type). The clinical features were investigated for each type, and postoperative complications such as postoperative vertebral collapse (PVC) and instrumentation failure were assessed after a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years (range: 1-8.1 years). All patients suffered from severe leg pain by radiculopathy, except one with superior-type fracture who exhibited cauda equina syndrome. Nineteen of 27 patients with superior- or inferior-type fracture were found to have spondylolisthesis due to segmental instability. Although postoperative neurological status improved significantly, lumbar lordosis and segmental lordosis at the fused level deteriorated from the postoperative period to the final follow-up due to postoperative complications caused mainly by PVC (29{\%}) and instrument failure (37{\%}). Posterior-instrumented fusion led to a good clinical outcome; however, a higher incidence of postoperative complications due to bone fragility was inevitable. Therefore, short-segment instrument and fusion with some augumentation techniqus, together with strong osteoporotic medications may be required to avoid such complications.},

Patients who received REBOA were compared with patients receiving OCCM for traumatic arrest using continuous vital sign monitoring and videography. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the REBOA group and 18 patients were enrolled in the OCCM group. Of the total patients, 86.3 per cent were male with a mean age of 36.2 +/- 13.9 years. Ninety-four percent of patients suffered penetrating trauma in the OCCM group compared with 30.3 per cent of the REBOA group (P = {\textless}0.001). Before aortic occlusion (AO), there was no difference in initial EtCO(2) values, but mean, median, peak, and final EtCO(2) values were lower in OCCM (P {\textless} 0.005).

abstract = {The majority of compressive vertebral fractures in osteoporotic bone occur at the level of the thoracolumbar junction. Immediate decompression is often required in order to reduce the extent of neurological damage. This study evaluated four fixation methods for decompression in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, and presented the most suitable method for osteoporotic patients. A finite element model of a T7-L5 spinal segment was created and subjected to an L1 corpectomy to simulate a serious burst fracture. Five models were tested: a) intact spine; 2) two segment fixation (TSF), 3) up-three segment fixation (UTSF), below-three segment fixation (BTSF), and four segment fixation (FSF). The ROM, stiffness and compression ratio of the fractured vertebra were recorded under various loading conditions. The results of this study showed that the ROM of the FSF model was the lowest, and the ROMs of UTSF and BTSF models were similar but still greater than the TSF model. Decreasing the BMD to simulate osteoporotic bone resulted in a ROM for the four instrumented models that was higher than the normal bone model. Of all models, the FSF model had the highest stiffness at T12-L2 in extension and lateral bending. Similarly, the compression ratio of the FSF model at L1 was also higher than the other instrumented models. In conclusion, FSF fixation is suggested for patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. For patients with normal bone quality, both UTSF and BTSF fixation provide an acceptable stiffness in extension and lateral bending, as well as a favorable compression ratio at L1.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human adipose stem cells (ASCs) have emerged as a promising treatment paradigm for skin wounds. Recent works demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of stem cells is partially mediated by extracellular vesicles, which comprise exosomes and microvesicles. In this study, we investigate the regenerative effects of isolated microvesicles from ASCs and evaluate the mechanisms how ASC microvesicles promote wound healing. METHODS: Adipose stem cell-derived microvesicles (ASC-MVs) were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation, stained by PKH26, and characterized by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We examined ASC-MV effects on proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Next, we explored the underlying mechanisms by gene expression analysis and the activation levels of AKT and ERK signaling pathways in all three kinds of cells after ASC-MV stimulation. We then assessed the effect of ASC-MVs on collagen deposition, neovascularization, and re-epithelialization in an in vivo skin injury model. RESULTS: ASC-MVs could be readily internalized by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), HaCAT, and fibroblasts and significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of these cells both in vitro and in vivo. The gene expression of proliferative markers (cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin A1, cyclin A2) and growth factors (VEGFA, PDGFA, EGF, FGF2) was significantly upregulated after ASC-MV treatment. Importantly, ASC-MVs stimulated the activation of AKT and ERK signaling pathways in those cells. The local injection of ASC-MVs at wound sites significantly increased the re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, and neovascularization and led to accelerated wound closure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ASC-MVs can stimulate HUVEC, HaCAT, and fibroblast functions. ASC-MV therapy significantly accelerates wound healing, and the benefits of ASC-MVs may due to the involvement of AKT and ERK signaling pathways. This illustrates the therapeutic potential of ASC-MVs which may become a novel treatment paradigm for cutaneous wound healing.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The optimal treatment for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine is controversial. The addition of screws in the fractured segment has been shown to improve construct stiffness, but can aggravate the trauma to the fractured vertebra. Therefore, optimised placement of two pedicle screws at the fracture level is required for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. This randomised controlled study is the first to examine the efficacy of diverse orders of pedicle screw placement and will provide recommendations for the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised controlled trial with blinding of patients and the statistician, but not the clinicians and researchers, will be conducted. A total of 70 patients with single AO type A3 or A4 thoracolumbar fractures who are candidates for application of short-segment pedicle screws at the fractured vertebral level will be allocated randomly to the distraction-screw and screw-distraction groups at a ratio of 1:1. The primary clinical outcome measures will be the percentage loss of vertebral body height, screw depth in the injured vertebrae and kyphosis (Cobb angle). Secondary clinical outcome measures will be complications, Visual Analogue Scale scores for back and leg pain, neurological function, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and Oswestry Disability Index. These parameters will be evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, on postoperative day 3, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Board of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University have reviewed and approved this study (batch: LCKY2018-05). The results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at an international spine-related meeting after completion of the study. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03384368; Pre-results.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This was a meta-analysis study. OBJECTIVE: To compare different posterior spine fixation methods for burst fracture fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: This study was performed to elucidate if the current body of literature supports one posterior spinal fusion fixation method for burst fracture to minimize the rate of implant failure and progression of posttraumatic kyphosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed for pertinent articles. The articles were examined against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data pertaining to kyphosis angle, Frankel score, vertebral level, blood loss, operation time, hospital stay, postoperative bracing, instrument failure, complications, and follow-up were collected. A random effects model was chosen due to variation among the individual studies' patient populations and surgical methods. RESULTS: A total of 23 publications were eventually deemed eligible according to the criteria and included into this study. The group with 2 levels above and 1 below with intermediate screws had the greatest maintenance of spine kyphosis and lowest implant failure at final follow-up (P{\textless}0.001). There was no difference between the periods of hospital stay (P=0.788) and blood loss (P=0.154) among different tiers. CONCLUSIONS: A fixation method consisting of 2 levels above and 1 below with intermediate screws for the thoracolumbar burst fractures showed the highest correction of kyphosis angle both at immediate and final follow-up and also the lowest implant failure at final follow-up.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar vertebral fracture without neurological deficit is still controversial.Management of vertebral fracture with percutaneous fixation was first reported in 2004.Advantages of percutaneous fixation are: less tissue dissection; decreased post-operative pain; decreased bleeding and operative time (depending on the steep learning curve); better screw positioning with fluoroscopy compared with an open freehand technique; and a decreased infection rate.The limitations of percutaneous fixation of vertebral fractures include increased radiation exposure to the patient and the surgeon, together with the steep learning curve for this technique.Adding a screw at the level of the fractured vertebra has the advantages of incorporating fewer motion segments with less operative time and bleeding. This also increases the axial, sagittal and torsional stiffness of the construct.Percutaneous fixation alone without grafting is sufficient for treating type A and B1 (AO classification) thoracolumbar fractures with satisfactory results concerning kyphosis reduction when compared with open instrumentation and fusion and with open fixation.Type C and B2 fractures (ligamentous injuries) should undergo fusion since the ligamentous healing is mechanically weak, increasing the risk of instability.This review offers a detailed description of percutaneous screw insertion and discusses the advantages and disadvantages.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of aortic occlusion (AO) during Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) using a sophisticated continuous vital sign (CVS) monitoring tool. METHODS: Patients admitted between February 2013 and May 2017 at a tertiary center that received REBOA were included. Patients in cardiac arrest before or at the time of REBOA were excluded. Time of AO was documented by time-stamped videography and correlated with CVS data. RESULTS: 28 patients were included, mean (standard deviation) ISS was 38 (11). 18 received Zone 1 (distal thoracic aorta) and 10 received Zone 3 (distal abdominal aorta) AO. Among Zone 1 patients the pre-AO systolic blood pressure (SBP) nadir was 64 (19) mmHg, which increased to a mean of 124 (29) mmHg within 5 min after AO (p {\textless} 0.01). Among Zone 3 patients the pre-AO SBP nadir was 75 (19) mmHg, which increased to a mean of 98 (14) mmHg within 5 min after AO (p {\textless} 0.01). 72{\%} of Zone 1 patients had episodes during AO where SBP was less than 90 mmHg as compared to 80{\%} of Zone 3 patients (p = 0.51). 100{\%} of Zone 1 patients had periods during AO where SBP was greater than 140 mmHg as compared to 70{\%} Zone 3 patients (p = 0.04). The overall mean decrease in SBP after balloon deflation was 13 (20) mmHg (p {\textless} 0.01), with similar decreases among groups (14 (21) mmHg vs 12 (18) mmHg for Zone 1 and 3 patients, respectively (p = 0.85)). Patients undergoing Zone 1 AO were more likely to have an acute change (increase or decrease) in their heart rate immediately after AO as compared to Zone 3 AO (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Significant hemodynamic alterations occur before, during, and after AO. The effects of Zone 1 AO on blood pressure and heart rate appear different than Zone 3 AO. This may have important implications for cardiac or cerebral function and perfusion goals, particularly with concomitant injuries such as cardiac contusion or traumatic brain injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The posterior longitudinal ligament plays a key role in spinal stability. The purpose of this study was to determine the injuries of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) in thoracolumbar burst fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients suffering a thoracolumbar burst fracture from January 2011 to December 2015 were divided into an intact group and a disrupted group according to the status of the PLL. Mid-sagittal canal diameter, width and height of bone fragments, inversion angle and horizontal rotation angle of bone fragments and local kyphosis angle were measured. Anterior, middle and posterior vertebrae compression ratio, mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio, ratio of height of bone fragments occupying the posterior wall of the injured vertebral body and ratio of the width of bone fragment occupying the transverse canal diameter were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were included in the study including 52 patients in the intact group and 43 patients in the disrupted group. There were significant differences on anterior and posterior vertebrae compression ratio, mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio, inversion angle and horizontal rotation angle of bone fragment (P 0.05) between the two groups. Injury of the PLL showed a positive correlation with the mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio and inversion angle of bone fragment (P 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio and inversion angle of bone fragment can be used to assess the status of the PLL in thoracolumbar burst fractures. When the mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio was 52{\%} and the inversion angle of the bone fragment was 33 degrees the PLL was likely to be disrupted.},

abstract = {Study Design: Technical report. Objectives: Conventional 2-dimensional (2D) video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is a technical procedure mainly performed by experienced surgeons. The technique may, however, come with difficulties in hand-eye coordination and estimation of depth. Three-dimensional thoracoscopy can help overcome these difficulties by providing a stereoscopic 3D view. The objective of this study is to report the first experience and results with 3D thoracoscopy for spine surgery in trauma patients. Methods: The first 4 patients treated with anterior stabilization for traumatic spine fractures using 3D thoracoscopy in an academic hospital are described. Baseline characteristics, operative time, and blood loss were retrospectively collected. This data is compared with a cohort of patients treated in the same center with the conventional 2D technique. Additionally, the treating surgeons' and residents' experience with the technique is described. Surgical equipment consists of 3D compatible video monitors, a videoscope with 2 cameras, and special glasses to be worn by the personnel. Results: Four patients were successfully treated using 3D thoracoscopy. Operative time was comparable to that of the conventional 2D technique and less blood loss occurred. No per- or postoperative complications or problems occurred. Per-operative views were of very high quality and provided improved depth perception. Surgeons and residents deemed the technique helpful, especially during technically demanding aspects of the procedure. Conclusions: While a shorter learning curve, decreased surgery time, and blood loss have to be proven in future prospective studies, the first experience with 3D-VATS for spine surgery is positive, and future use in minimally invasive spine surgery seems feasible.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The management of thoracolumbar burst fractures often includes combined anterior/posterior approaches with prolonged operative time and complications. The transpedicular approach offers a posterior only approach with circumferential reconstruction and decompression. We aim to present the experience of a single center in the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures using a posterior-only approach for circumferential stabilization and report on this technique's effectiveness in restoring the alignment of the thoracolumbar junction. METHODS: A case review of the medical records of patients admitted to the adult neurosurgery service (from January 2011 through June 2014) with traumatic non-pathological thoracolumbar burst fractures and subsequently treated with a transpedicular corpectomy (including the placement of an expandable cage) was performed, retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent a posterior transpedicular corpectomy consisting of anterior column reconstruction using an expandable cage with supplementary posterior fixation within 72 hours of injury. The average pre-operative canal compromise was 69{\%}. The average pre-operative kyphotic angle was 21.6 degrees . The average post-operative kyphotic angle was 5.15 degrees , with an average correction of 16.45 degrees . There were 11 patients with pre-operative neurological compromises, of which patients, 8 experienced variable degrees of recovery. The average operating time was 410.5 minutes (range, 240-550 min). The average blood loss was 880 mL (range, 650-1500). Three patients experienced complications during surgery; 1 patient died. CONCLUSION: The transpedicular approach for circumferential reconstruction and stabilization provides an alternative technique for the management of thoracolumbar fractures, having an acceptable risk and the associated lower morbidity of a posterioronly approach.},

abstract = {Lumbar spine fusion is a common procedure associated with a high cost burden and  risk of serious complications. We aimed to summarise systematic reviews on the effectiveness of lumbar spine fusion for most diagnoses. We found no high-quality systematic reviews and the risk of bias of the randomised controlled trials in the reviews was generally high. The available evidence does not support a benefit from spine fusion compared to non-operative alternatives for back pain associated with degeneration. The available evidence does not support a clinical benefit from spine fusion compared to non-operative treatment or stabilisation without fusion for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Benefits of spine fusion compared to non-operative treatment for isthmic spondylolisthesis are unclear (one trial at high risk of bias). Surgical intervention for metastatic carcinoma of the spine associated with spinal cord compromise improves mobility and neurological outcome (based on a single trial). Better evidence is required to determine more accurately the effectiveness of spine fusion surgery for all indications. Patients contemplating spinal fusion should be fully informed about the evidence base for their particular problem, including the relative potential benefits and harms of fusion compared with non-operative treatments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore a method of modified incision to prevent the postoperative  spinal lateral angulation via anterior approach for lumbar fracture. METHODS: A total 40 patients with lumbar fracture from January 2016 to Jun 2017 were internalized in the study. Including 28 males and 12 females, aged from 27 to 68 years with an average of (39.5+/-14.9) years. Among them, 28 cases caused by high fall, 9 cases by heavy injury, 3 cases by traffic accidents; and 35 fractures were located at L(1),4 at L(2),1 at L(3). All the fractures were type A based on AO classification. According to Frankel classify of spinal cord injury, 5 cases were grade A, 1 case was B, 10 cases were C, 15 cases were D, 9 cases were E. The patients were divided randomly into modified incision groups and routine incision groups. All patients were treated with decompression, internal fixation and titanium mesh supported bone graft fusion via anterior approach. All the internal fixation materials were ANTERIOR (Medtronic Inc). Incision direction and incision plane were improved in modified incision groups. The coronal Cobb angle and the angle between the vertebral screw and the corresponding endplate were analyzed before and after operation. RESULTS: Pre-and post-operative coronal Cobb angles were (1.20+/-3.26) degrees , ( 2.16+/-3.55) degrees in modified incision groups and(1.22+/-4.42) degrees , (3.91+/-3.78) degrees in routine incision groups respectively. And there was no statistical difference before operation, and there was statistical difference after operation between two groups(P=0.017). There was no lateral angulation of more than 5 degrees in modified incision group, but there was lateral angulation of 5 to 10 degrees in routine incision group in 6 cases. The incidence of lateral angulation about 5 degrees after operation was significantly different between two groups (P=0.010). There was significant difference in the angle between the proximal two vertebral screws and the corresponding endplate between two groups (P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference in the angle between the distal two vertebral screws and the corresponding endplate (P{\textgreater}0.05).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purposes of the study were to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of augmented vertebroplasty using a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) implant, for the treatment of lumbar or thoracic vertebral fractures (A2 according to the Magerl's AO classification) and to analyze pain reduction, height restoration, and complications during a 2-year follow-up period. METHODS: Prospective non-randomized evaluation was performed for 21 painful split vertebral fractures (20 patients, 14 females, 6 males; mean age 72.80 +/- 10.991) treated with percutaneous vertebral augmentation using a PEEK device, under fluoroscopic guidance. Pain before the procedure and after 6, 12, and 24 months was evaluated using a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. Imaging was performed by CT and X-rays. The minimum craniocaudal diameter at the level of the fracture and the maximum craniocaudal diameter at the middle of the fractured vertebra were measured. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate pain decrease and height restoration. RESULTS: Successful implant positioning was achieved in all cases. No major clinical complications were observed. Comparing the mean pain scores at baseline (8.69 +/- 1.138) and the first day after the treatment (1.19 +/- 1.424), there was a decrease of 7.50 NVS units (p {\textless} 0.001). Minimum and maximum vertebral body heights were increased after the procedure 56.58{\%} and 13.7{\%} respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Both pain relief and height restoration remained statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.001) during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: A2 Magerl thoracic or lumbar fractures could be successfully treated with PEEK implant-assisted vertebral augmentation. Randomized studies with larger sample sizes should be done to confirm the effectiveness of the technique. KEY POINTS: * Vertebral augmentation using a PEEK implant for the treatment of A2 Magerl lumbar or thoracic vertebral fractures seems to be effective both in terms of pain reduction and height restoration. * Effects on pain reduction and height restoration have a long-term duration. * The technique seems to be safe for the treatment of A2 Magerl fractures, without major complications in our study group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The conservative treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar vertebral fractures is often not clearly defined. METHODS: This review is based on articles retrieved by a systematic search in the PubMed and Web of Science databases for publications up to February 2018 dealing with the conservative treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar vertebral fractures. The search initially yielded 3345 hits, of which 35 were suitable for use in this review. RESULTS: It can be concluded from the available original clinical research on the subject, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), that the primary diagnostic evaluation should be with plain x-rays, in the standing position if possible. If a fracture is suspected on the plain films, computed tomography (CT) is indicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is additionally advisable if there is a burst fracture. The spinal deformity resulting from the fracture should be quantified in terms of the Cobb angle. The choice of a conservative or operative treatment strategy is based on the primary stability of the fracture, the degree of deformity, the presence or absence of disc injury, and the patient's clinical state. Our analysis of the three RCTs implies that early functional therapy without a corset should be performed, although treatment in a corset may be appropriate to control pain. Follow-up x-rays should be obtained after mobilization and at one week, three weeks, six weeks, and twelve weeks. CONCLUSION: Further comparative studies of the indications for surgery and specific conservative treatment modalities would be desirable.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Turnover of cartilage endplate extracellular matrix (ECM) may play an  important role in disc degeneration and low back pain (LBP). However, the expression pattern of pro-inflammatory factors, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) in the cartilage endplates (CEP) of intervertebral discs (IVD) is not understood. We aimed to examine the transcriptional levels of MMP, TIMP, and interleukins (IL), and the correlations between them. METHODS: Thirty degenerated cartilage endplate samples from patients with LBP who underwent lumbar fusion surgery were included in the degenerated group. Ten patients without LBP history who underwent lumbar surgery because of vertebral burst fractures were included in the control group. The degenerative severity of the samples was evaluated by MRI, and hematoxylin-eosin and safranin O-fast green (SO-FG) staining. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. The correlations between the levels of these genes were tested using Spearman's rho test. RESULTS: Hematoxylin-eosin and SO-FG staining confirmed a decrease in cell number and proteoglycans in the degenerated cartilage endplate. MRI showed significant signal changes in degenerated cartilage endplates. Patients in the degenerated group showed a higher rate of endplate Modic changes when compared with the control group. MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-3, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta were elevated with statistical significance, while MMP-1, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and IL-6 were changed without statistical significance or remained unchanged. Expression of MMP-3 was positively correlated with IL-1alpha (Spearman coefficient, 0.486; P {\textless} 0.05); expression of TIMP-3 was positively correlated with MMP-9, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta (Spearman coefficient, 0.577, 0.407, and 0.571, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-3, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta may play a role in the process of cartilage endplate degeneration. MMP-3 may be regulated by IL-1alpha, and TIMP-3 might be associated with MMP-9 and regulated by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective study of 2 cohorts. OBJECTIVE: Compare the clinical and radiologic outcome of 2 cohorts of unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures treated by open posterior fixation (OPF) with bone graft or by percutaneous fixation (PCF) without grafting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In recent years, PCF is the most common treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. To date, no studies have analyzed clinical outcomes in terms of return to work. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two cohorts of patients with unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures fractures (type A2, A3, and A4) without neurological symptoms underwent OPF (n=91) or PCF (n=54) between 2010 and 2015. A conventional radiologic study was performed in the preoperative, immediate postoperative period, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at 1-year and 2-year follow-up. The period to return to work and the type of work were also recorded. RESULTS: The percentages of correction were significantly higher in cases operated by OPF: fracture angle (P{\textless}0.001), kyphotic deformity (P{\textless}0.001), vertebral compression (P{\textless}0.001), and displacement (P{\textless}0.001). Cases operated by PCF experienced greater loss of correction at 2-year follow-up, especially in fracture displacement (P{\textless}0.001), deformity angle (P{\textless}0.001), kyphotic deformity (P{\textless}0.001), and in the sagittal index (P{\textless}0.001). Besides this greater loss of correction, PCF cases showed better Visual Analog Scale (P{\textless}0.001) and Oswestry Disability Index scores (P{\textless}0.001) at final follow-up. The percentage of patients returning to the same heavy work position was higher in the PCF group (P{\textless}0.001) and in a shorter period of time (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The greater loss of correction of patients undergoing PCF does not reflect the clinical outcomes that were significantly better as compared to patients undergoing open fixation with grafting. It would be useful to further evaluate if the radiological changes could have a long-term clinical significance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare intermediate screws (IS) with kyphoplasty (KP) in posterior short-segment fixation (PSSF) for patients with single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, 1465 patients were retrospectively reviewed; 48 patients were enrolled with a minimal follow-up of 2 years. Perioperative and functional outcomes were compared. The regional Cobb angle (CA) was included in radiographic analysis. Implant failures or CA correction loss over 10 degrees were regarded as surgical failures. Multiple linear regression was performed to investigate the risk factors of kyphosis recurrence. RESULTS: Fluoroscopic time (23.7 +/- 3.6 vs. 79.3 +/- 12.1 s, p {\textless} 0.001), operative time (109.6 +/- 13.1 vs. 123.8 +/- 19.0 min, p = 0.006) and blood loss (104.6 +/- 34.9 vs. 129.1 +/- 21.7 ml, p = 0.005) were all lower in the IS group. The KP group had lower Visual Analogue Scale scores (3.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.8, p = 0.028) and greater anterior body height (ABH) (30.3 +/- 9.0 vs. 36.3 +/- 11.0{\%}, p = 0.044) after surgery, and less correction loss (5.6 +/- 2.7 vs. 0.4 +/- 1.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Both groups had a CA correction loss of 4 degrees with a 10{\%} failure rate. The A3 Magerl subclassification, smaller preoperative ABH and smaller postoperative CA had positive correlations with CA correction loss. CONCLUSION: PSSF with KP provides better back pain relief, greater ABH reduction and less correction loss, while IS has the advantages of less operative time, fluoroscopic time and blood loss. Magerl subclassification of burst fracture is a potential predictor for recurrent kyphosis. Reducing fractured vertebral body height rather than segmental curvature may be more important in PSSF.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery using a mini-open lateral retropleural or  retroperitoneal approach for corpectomy is a well-described procedure for treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Most surgeons have incorporated fluoroscopy for localization and determination of hardware placement accuracy; however, the utility of computer-assisted image-guided spinal navigation has not been well described. We report a series of mini-open lateral approach thoracolumbar corpectomy cases using either fluoroscopy or intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) with computer-assisted navigation and discuss the technical nuances and advantages of using iCT with navigation versus fluoroscopy. METHODS: A retrospective review and analysis was performed of the cases of 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures surgically managed via mini-open lateral corpectomy with fluoroscopy (2013-2015) or iCT navigation (2015-2017). The surgical outcomes were evaluated by the estimated blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, and need for revision. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the numerical rating scale pain score. Radiographic outcomes were assessed with follow-up CT scans. The results were statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 13.4 months for the fluoroscopy group and 14.7 months for the iCT group. No surgical complications developed and no revisions were required. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in surgical or clinical outcomes. However, the radiation exposure to the surgeons was significantly less with the iCT group (P {\textless} 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The use of iCT with spinal navigation for mini-open lateral corpectomy for thoracolumbar burst fractures yields perioperative and clinical outcomes comparable to those using traditional fluoroscopy, with decreased radiation exposure to surgeons.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and to underline the right indications of the posterior monosegmental stabilization for the treatment of thoraco-lumbar spine fractures. METHOD: Twenty patients underwent a monosegmental stabilization at our Institution and were retrospectively reviewed with a minimum follow-up of two years. All the patients had a clinical and radiological assessment before, after the surgery and at final follow-up. All data were evaluated by one independent observer. Data collected were Denis pain and work scale, somatic kyphosis (SK), somatic height (SH), and compression percentage (CP). RESULTS: The mean pre-operative SK angle measured between the upper and lower end plate of the fractured vertebra was 23.6 degrees . The mean SK immediately after surgery was 12.8 degrees and at final follow-up was 13.9 degrees . The mean pre-operative SH was 21.9 mm, the mean value after surgery was 26.5 mm, and at final follow-up was 24.8 mm. The mean pre-operative CP was 66.7{\%}, the mean value after surgery was 80.9{\%}, and at final follow-up was 75.3{\%}. At final follow-up, 75{\%} of the patients had no pain or moderate pain and 95{\%} of the patients returned to a full time work. CONCLUSIONS: Monosegmental stabilization with fusion is a safe and effective method to treat well selected thoracolumbar spine fractures. The right indications are type A1, type B2, and type A3 with a load sharing of less than 7 points and some very well selected type C fractures in which there is not lateral and rotatory displacement.},

abstract = {Pneumothorax is a principal diagnosis for emergency management services (EMS) providers to make because it is a potentially life-threatening condition that is commonly associated with complaints such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and trauma. The condition spans all age groups, and EMS providers should, therefore, maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax for any patient with a sudden onset of acute respiratory distress and ipsilateral chest pain. Pneumothorax is the entry of air into the potential space between the parietal and visceral pleura. Air can enter the chest cavity from a rupture in the lung tissue or trauma to the pleura. Lung tissue can burst spontaneously in patients with risk factors such as tobacco use, Marfan's syndrome, underwater diving, airplane travel, and male gender. It can also occur secondarily as a part of a chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the destruction of lung tissue.[1] EMS providers may also encounter several different mechanisms of injury that violate the pleura creating a pneumothorax, such as penetrating trauma to the chest or blunt trauma with a rib fracture. EMS providers may be called to the outpatient setting where medical/holistic procedures involving the chest or neck may cause an iatrogenic pneumothorax, such as central venous catheter placement, thoracentesis, and lung biopsies. EMS providers are challenged in making the diagnosis for several reasons. They do not have access to emergency department tools such as chest radiographs and point of care thoracic ultrasound which may clinch the diagnosis. Many patients will have comorbid conditions that may mimic a pneumothorax including COPD/asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pleural effusions, which may have decreased breath sounds during acute exacerbations and acute dyspnea. A hemothorax will have a similar presentation as a hemothorax such as dyspnea, hypoxia, decreased breath sounds, and chest pain. A key clinical finding that separates these two is that a pneumothorax will have hyper-resonance to percussion, but a hemothorax will have a hypo-resonance to percussion. Both of these will need a chest tube, but only a tension pneumothorax will require needle decompression. Ambient noise in the field may drown out differences in lateralized breath sounds. Low light, body fluid, and other environmental factors may make otherwise obvious chest wall openings unapparent in emergencies. In the appropriate clinical setting of acute dyspnea, but equivocal breath sounds, EMS providers may percuss the thorax for unilateral hyper-resonance and asymmetric tactile fremitus in making the diagnosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Standard radiographs are still considered as the gold standard for  the early assessment of thoraco-lumbar osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs), although several studies demonstrated superior accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnostic process of OVFs. The aim of this study was to quantify the misdiagnosis rate of OVFs and analyse the impact of MRI on early diagnosis and classification, compared to standard radiographs alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 173 patients were enrolled in this study. All participants were 55 years of age or older (60 years for men) and complained acute back pain with suspected thoracolumbar OVFs without history of high-energy trauma. Diagnosis of OVF was initially performed on standard radiographs obtained in the emergency room. Then, all the patients underwent MRI scan with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequencing within 7 days. We compared the level and number of fractures identified on standard radiographs with the MRI scan results. The discordance between radiographic and MRI diagnosis was quantified. Fractures were classified according to AO Spine Classification. RESULTS: Mean age of the study participant was 74.2 years (range 55-92). They were 100 males and 73 females. MRI modified initial diagnosis in 52{\%} (90/173) of our patients: in 43.9{\%} of patients MRI identified one or more new thoracolumbar fracture. In 14 cases (8.1{\%}) MRI disproved the evidence of any thoracolumbar fracture, even those recognized at plain X-rays. Bone bruise was detected by MRI in 19 vertebral bodies in 8 patients (4.6{\%}) at levels that were classified as unremarkable on X-ray alone. In addition, 63 patients (36.4{\%}) presented a total of 93 old fractures. The classification of fracture pattern after MRI changed in 28.90{\%} of the patients (changes mostly involved AO type A1 patterns). CONCLUSIONS: Underdiagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is a common problem due to a lack of radiographic detection. Our results showed that the extensive use of MRI imaging allows better accuracy in the diagnostic process and in the classification assessment, compared to conventional radiographs. Further investigation should provide additional information about the impact of early MRI on treatment and management of elderly patients with suspected OVFs, including the decision to hospitalize or not, and how it could affect clinical outcome and social costs.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. PURPOSE: To evaluate radiological parameters as indicators for posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries in the case of limited availability of magnetic resonance imaging. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fractures with PLC injuries can be misdiagnosed on X-rays or computed tomography scans. This study aimed to retrospectively assess unrecognized PLC injuries and evaluate radiographic parameters as indicators of PLC injuries requiring surgery. METHODS: In total, 314 patients with type A and type B2 fractures who underwent surgical treatment between 2001 and 2010 were included. The frequency of misdiagnosis was reassessed, and radiographic parameters were evaluated and correlated. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 51.8 years. There were 225 type A3/A4 and 89 type B2 fractures; 39 of the type B2 fractures (43.8{\%}) had been misdiagnosed as type A fractures. Type B fractures presented with a significantly higher kyphotic wedge angle and Cobb angle and a lower sagittal index (SI) than type A fractures. In addition, the normalized interspinous distance was higher in type B2 fractures. The significant mathematical indicators for PLC injuries were as follows: Cobb angle+kyphotic wedge angle {\textgreater}29 degrees ; Cobb angle2 {\textgreater}170 degrees ; and vertebral angle/SI {\textgreater}25. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that PLC injuries are frequently misdiagnosed. Correlations between certain radiological parameters associated with PLC injuries can be useful indicators of the presence of such injuries requiring surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures has traditionally involved spinal instrumentation with fusion performed with standard open surgical techniques. Novel surgical strategies, including instrumentation without fusion and percutaneous instrumentation alone, have been considered less invasive and more efficient treatments. OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature and determine the role of fusion in instrumented fixation, as well as the role of percutaneous instrumentation, in the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: The task force members identified search terms/parameters and a medical librarian implemented the literature search, consistent with the literature search protocol (see Appendix I), using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from January 1, 1946 to March 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 906 articles were identified and 38 were selected for full-text review. Of these articles, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. CONCLUSION: There is grade A evidence for the omission of fusion in instrumented fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. There is grade B evidence that percutaneous instrumentation is as effective as open instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. QUESTION: Does the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented fixation improve outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures? RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that in the surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, surgeons should understand that the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented stabilization has not been shown to impact clinical or radiological outcomes, and adds to increased blood loss and operative time. Strength of Recommendation: Grade A. QUESTION: How does the use of minimally invasive techniques (including percutaneous instrumentation) affect outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for thoracic and lumbar fractures compared to conventional open techniques? RECOMMENDATION: Stabilization using both open and percutaneous pedicle screws may be considered in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures as the evidence suggests equivalent clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Background: Management of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial in the literature. The primary aims of this study were to assess different levels of fixation with respect to radiological outcomes in terms of fracture reduction and future loss of correction. Methods: This is a single center, retrospective study. Fifty-five patients presenting with thoracolumbar fractures between January 2012 and December 2015 were analyzed in the study. The levels of fixation were divided in 3 groups: 1 vertebra above and 1 below the fracture (1/1), 2 above and 2 below (2/2), and 2 above and 1 below (2/1). Results: The most common mechanism was high fall injury, and the most common vertebra L1. Burst fractures were the ones with the highest incidence. The 2/2 fixation achieved the best reduction of the fracture, but with no statistical significance. The correction is maintained better by the 2/2 fixation, but there is no statistical difference compared to the other fixations. Insertion of screws at the fracture level did not improve outcomes. Conclusion: The data of this study identified a trend toward better radiological outcomes for fracture reduction and maintenance of the correction in the 2/2 fixations. However, these results are not statistically significant. Future multicenter prospective clinical trials are needed in order to agree on the ideal management and method of fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) combined with microbubbles (MB) contrast agent infusion has been shown to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBBD), increasing the delivery of neurotherapeutics to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases. pFUS interaction with the intravascular MB results in acoustic cavitation forces passing through the neurovascular unit (NVU), inducing BBBD detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Multiple pFUS+MB exposures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models are being investigated as a method to clear amyloid plaques by activated microglia or infiltrating immune cells. Since it has been reported that pFUS+MB can induce a sterile inflammatory response (SIR) [1-5] in the rat, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential long-term effects of SIR in the brain following single and six weekly sonications by serial high-resolution MRI and pathology. Methods: Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing 217+/-16.6 g prior to sonication received bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to tag proliferating cells in the brain. pFUS was performed at 548 kHz, ultrasound burst 10 ms and initial peak negative pressure of 0.3 MPa (in water) for 120 s coupled with a slow infusion of {\~{}}460 microL/kg (5-8x10(7) MB) that started 30 s before and 30 s during sonication. Nine 2 mm focal regions in the left cortex and four regions over the right hippocampus were treated with pFUS+MB. Serial high-resolution brain MRIs at 3 T and 9.4 T were obtained following a single or during the course of six weekly pFUS+MB resulting in BBBD in the left cortex and the right hippocampus. Animals were monitored over 7 to 13 weeks and imaging results were compared to histology. Results: Fewer than half of the rats receiving a single pFUS+MB exposure displayed hypointense voxels on T2*-weighted (w) MRI at week 7 or 13 in the cortex or hippocampus without differences compared to the contralateral side on histograms of T2* maps. Single sonicated rats had evidence of limited microglia activation on pathology compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Six weekly pFUS+MB treatments resulted in pathological changes on T2*w images with multiple hypointense regions, cortical atrophy, along with 50{\%} of rats having persistent BBBD and astrogliosis by MRI. Pathologic analysis of the multiple sonicated animals demonstrated the presence of metallophagocytic Prussian blue-positive cells in the parenchyma with significantly (p{\textless}0.05) increased areas of activated astrocytes and microglia, and high numbers of systemic infiltrating CD68(+) macrophages along with BrdU(+) cells compared to contralateral brain. In addition, multiple treatments caused an increase in the number of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau)-positive neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the sonicated cortex but not in the hippocampus when compared to contralateral brain, which was confirmed by Western blot (WB) (p{\textless}0.04). Conclusions: The repeated SIR following multiple pFUS+MB treatments could contribute to changes on MR imaging including persistent BBBD, cortical atrophy, and hypointense voxels on T2w and T2*w images consistent with pathological injury. Moreover, areas of astrogliosis, activated microglia, along with higher numbers of CD68(+) infiltrating macrophages and BrdU(+) cells were detected in multiple sonicated areas of the cortex and hippocampus. Elevations in pTau and NFT were detected in neurons of the multiple sonicated cortex. Minimal changes on MRI and histology were observed in single pFUS+MB-treated rats at 7 and 13 weeks post sonication. In comparison, animals that received 6 weekly sonications demonstrated evidence on MRI and histology of vascular damage, inflammation and neurodegeneration associated with the NVU commonly observed in trauma. Further investigation is recommended of the long-term effects of multiple pFUS+MB in clinical trials.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between lean psoas cross-sectional area (CSA) and 1-year all-cause mortality in elderly patients sustaining pelvic and long bone fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: Elderly trauma patients admitted from 2007 to 2014. METHODS: We reviewed demographic and clinical data, injury mechanism, fracture OTA/AO classification, and mortality. Axial computed tomography images were used to measure lean psoas CSA at the L3-L4 disk space. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate 1-year mortality association with psoas CSA in crude and adjusted for age, body mass index, Injury Severity Score, medical comorbidities, and discharge destination in total population and stratified by sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: One-year all-cause mortality defined as death within 12 months from date of hospitalization. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-eight patients (54{\%} female, 46{\%} male) were analyzed. The pelvis was most commonly fractured (37.81{\%}). A statistically significant association was observed between decreased lean psoas CSA and 1-year mortality in total population {\{}hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.90-0.96], P {\textless} 0.0001{\}}. Stratification by gender revealed a statistically significant mortality HR in male patients [HR = 0.89 (95{\%} CI = 0.84-0.96), P = 0.002].

Methods: This is a retrospective case series. Patients treated nonsurgically for AOSpine type A fractures (T1-L5) with at least 1 year follow-up identified. A standing antero-posterior and lateral 36-inch radiographs and measures of spino-pelvic relationships and sagittal alignment were obtained, as well as clinical assessment using the visual analog scale, the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and labor status. Results: Twenty-two patients with 33 fractures were included (L1 was the most injured level with 18.2{\%}). There were 17 men (77.2{\%}) and the mean age was 47.1 years. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months (mean of 27.8 months). There were 22 type A1 (66.7{\%}), 3 type A2 (9{\%}), 6 type A3 (18{\%}), and 2 type A4 (6{\%}) fractures. The ODI ranged from 4{\%} to 58{\%}, with a mean of 24.4{\%}. The SF-36 physical health score ranged from 23 to 82.25 (mean 49.59), and the mental health score ranged from 14.75 to 94.25 (mean 63.28). No association was identified between the spino-pelvic measurements, global alignment, and patient-reported outcomes.

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the inter and intraobserver agreement of the Magerl AO and AOSpine thoracolumbar fracture classification systems. Methods: The participants were divided into two groups, the first composed of six spinal surgeons and the other composed of 18 medical orthopedic residents. On two different occasions, separated by an interval of one month, the participants analyzed and classified 25 radiographs with thoracolumbar fractures using both thoracolumbar fracture classification systems, Magerl AO and AOSpine. The results were analyzed for classification reliability using the Kappa coefficient (k). Results: The Magerl AO classification system showed a fair interobserver agreement (k = 0.32), considering the fractures type and subtype, whereas the AOSpine classification system showed a moderate interobserver agreement (k = 0.59). The Magerl AO classification showed a fair intraobserver agreement for both residents and specialists (k = 0.21 and 0.38, respectively), while the AOSpine showed a substantial agreement between residents (k = 0.62) and moderate between specialists (k = 0.53). Conclusions: When evaluating fracture morphology, the AOSpine thoracolumbar fracture classification system presented a better reliability and reproducibility compared to the Magerl AO classification system.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define radiologic parameters and the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) scan on posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury, identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with thoracolumbar (TL) fracture. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 88 patients with TL fractures divided into 2 groups by PLC status evident on MRI: intact and ruptured. The parameters assessed included the anterior fractured vertebral body height (AVH) and posterior fractured vertebral body height, upper and lower AVH, anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, AVH ratio, local kyphotic angle (LKA), region angle (RA), sagittal index (SI), Gardner angle (GA), Gardner index (GI), Cobb angle, interspinous distance (ISD), upper and lower ISD, ISD ratio, interspinous distance minus (ISDM), interspinous angle (ISA), and upper and lower ISA. The t test, Pearson chi(2) test, and multivariate logistic regression were used. RESULTS: PLC rupture (vs. intact) was associated with RA, GA, GI, ISD, ISD ratio, and ISDM. The positive risk factors for PLC rupture were GA, LKA, SI, and RA. The negative risk factors for PLC rupture were SI greater than 20 degrees and GI. PLC rupture was associated with the SI, upper interspinous distance, ISD ratio, ISDM, and ISA in those with type A1/A2 fractures and the GA, GI, ISD, ISD ratio, and ISDM in those with type A3/A4 fractures. CONCLUSIONS: An RA greater than 16 degrees , SI greater than 20 degrees , and GI greater than 24 degrees were associated with PLC injury in patients with type A TL fractures, and an RA greater than 16 degrees and SI greater than 20 degrees predicted PLC injury in type A1 and A2 fractures. An SI greater than 20 degrees , GI greater than 24 degrees , LKA greater than 26 degrees , and ISD ratio greater than 56{\%} predicted PLC injury in type A3 and A4 fractures.},

abstract = {The authors present a new minimally invasive posterior thoracic and upper lumbar  spinal approach, using midline-staged incision with bilateral dissection via the natural muscular cleavage plane between the spinalis and longissimus muscles for pedicle fixation. The aim was to clarify anatomy and compare results between this technique and the conventional paraspinal approach. An anatomic MRI study determined the position of the superficial aponeurosis of the spinalis-longissimus intermuscular cleavage plane with respect to the midline. The surgical procedure is described. A radiological and clinical study evaluated 24 patients divided into two comparative groups, operated on via the medial intermuscular or the paraspinal approach, for isolated A3 and B2 Magerl fracture between T2 and L2, without neurologic involvement. Pain, postoperative complications, reduction quality and esthetic satisfaction were assessed. MRI located the cleavage plane, which was consistently 11.01+/-0.9mm (range, 9.4-12.3mm) from the midline. In the "medial approach" group, hospital stay was significantly shorter, by 3 days, at 4+/-1.9 (range, 2-8 days) (p: 0.005); pain on VAS was 2 points lower at postoperative day 1 (2.1+/-1.4; range,{\textless}/=1-4; p:0.032), and lower at discharge (0.3+/-0.6; range, 0-1; p: 0.001). The scar was considered esthetically very satisfactory. This easily performed and reproducible medial intermuscular approach showed low iatrogenesis, significantly improving postoperative course.},

abstract = {Study Design: Review of literature and case series. Objectives: Update and review of current treatment concepts for spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders. Methods: Case presentation and description of a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for unstable spinal injuries with an underlying ankylosing spinal disorder (ASD) of the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. Results: Nondisplaced fractures can be missed easily using conventional X-rays. Thus, computed tomography (CT) scans are recommended for all trauma patients with ASD. In doubt or presence of any neurologic involvement additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans should be obtained. Spine precautions should be maintained all times and until definitive treatment ({\textless}24 h). Nonoperative fracture treatment is not recommended given the mechanical instability of the most commonly seen fracture patterns (AOSpine B- and C-type, M2) in patients with ASD and inherent high risk of secondary neurologic deterioration. For patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis (DISH) sustaining cervical spine fractures, a combined anterior-posterior instrumentation for fracture fixation is recommended. Closed reduction and patient positioning can be challenging in presence of preexisting kyphotic deformities. In the thoracolumbar (TL) spine, a posterior instrumentation extending 2 to 3 levels above and below the fracture level is recommended to maintain adequate reduction and stability until fracture healing. Minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screws and cement augmentation can help to minimize the surgical trauma and strengthen the construct stability in patients with diminished minor bone quality (osteopenia, osteoporosis). Conclusions: Current concepts, treatment options, and recommendations of the German Orthopedic Trauma Society-Spine Section for spinal fractures in the ankylosed spine have been outlined.},

abstract = {Study Design: consensus paper with systematic literature review. Objective: The aim of this study was to establish recommendations for treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures based on systematic review of current literature and consensus of several spine surgery experts. Methods: The project was initiated in September 2008 and published in Germany in 2011. It was redone in 2017 based on systematic literature review, including new AOSpine classification. Members of the expert group were recruited from all over Germany working in hospitals of all levels of care. In total, the consensus process included 9 meetings and 20 hours of video conferences. Results: As regards existing studies with highest level of evidence, a clear recommendation regarding treatment (operative vs conservative) or regarding type of surgery (posterior vs anterior vs combined anterior-posterior) cannot be given. Treatment has to be indicated individually based on clinical presentation, general condition of the patient, and radiological parameters. The following specific parameters have to be regarded and are proposed as morphological modifiers in addition to AOSpine classification: sagittal and coronal alignment of spine, degree of vertebral body destruction, stenosis of spinal canal, and intervertebral disc lesion. Meanwhile, the recommendations are used as standard algorithm in many German spine clinics and trauma centers. Conclusion: Clinical presentation and general condition of the patient are basic requirements for decision making. Additionally, treatment recommendations offer the physician a standardized, reproducible, and in Germany commonly accepted algorithm based on AOSpine classification and 4 morphological modifiers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracic and lumbar burst fractures in neurologically intact patients are considered to be inherently stable, and responsive to nonsurgical management. There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal conservative treatment modality. The question remains whether external bracing is necessary vs mobilization without a brace after these injuries. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of external bracing improves outcomes compared to no brace for neurologically intact patients with thoracic or lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for studies relevant to thoracolumbar trauma. Clinical studies specifically comparing external bracing to no brace for neurologically intact patients with thoracic or lumbar burst fractures were selected for review. RESULTS: Three studies out of 1137 met inclusion criteria for review. One randomized controlled trial (level I) and an additional randomized controlled pilot study (level II) provided evidence that both external bracing and no brace equally improve pain and disability in neurologically intact patients with burst fractures. There was no difference in final clinical and radiographic outcomes between patients treated with an external brace vs no brace. One additional level IV retrospective study demonstrated equivalent clinical outcomes for external bracing vs no brace. CONCLUSION: This evidence-based guideline provides a grade B recommendation that management either with or without an external brace is an option given equivalent improvement in outcomes for neurologically intact patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures. The decision to use an external brace is at the discretion of the treating physician, as bracing is not associated with increased adverse events compared to no brace. QUESTION: Does the use of external bracing improve outcomes in the nonoperative treatment of neurologically intact patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures? RECOMMENDATION: The decision to use an external brace is at the discretion of the treating physician, as the nonoperative management of neurologically intact patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures either with or without an external brace produces equivalent improvement in outcomes.

  abstract = {Pathogenic trypanosomatids (Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania spp.) are protozoan parasites that cause neglected diseases affecting millions of people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In the process of infection, trypanosomatids evade and survive the immune system attack, which can lead to a chronic inflammatory state that induces cumulative damage, often killing the host in the long term. The immune mediators involved in this process are not entirely understood. Most of the research on the immunologic control of protozoan infections has been focused on acute inflammation. Nevertheless, when this process is not terminated adequately, permanent damage to the inflamed tissue may ensue. Recently, a second process, called resolution of inflammation, has been proposed to be a pivotal process in the control of parasite burden and establishment of chronic infection. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that promotes the normal function of injured or infected tissues. Several mediators are involved in this process, including eicosanoid-derived lipids, cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-10, and other proteins such as Annexin-V. For example, during T. cruzi infection, pro-resolving lipids such as 15-epi-lipoxin-A4 and Resolvin D1 have been associated with a decrease in the inflammatory changes observed in experimental chronic heart disease, reducing inflammation and fibrosis, and increasing host survival. Furthermore, Resolvin D1 modulates the immune response in cells of patients with Chagas disease. In Leishmania spp. infections, pro-resolving mediators such as Annexin-V, lipoxins, and Resolvin D1 are related to the modulation of cutaneous manifestation of the disease. However, these mediators seem to have different roles in visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis. Finally, although T. brucei infections are less well studied in terms of their relationship with inflammation, it has been found that arachidonic acid-derived lipids act as key regulators of the host immune response and parasite burden. Also, cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta may be related to increased infection. Knowledge about the inflammation resolution process is necessary to understand the host-parasite interplay, but it also offers an interesting opportunity to improve the current therapies, aiming to reduce the detrimental state induced by chronic protozoan infections.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 28 patients with two-segment thoracolumbar fractures without neural dysfunction treated from January 2013 to August 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 17 males and 11 females, with a mean age of(37.5+/-10.3) years (ranging from 19 to 55 years). According to fracture AO classification, all 28 cases were type A, including 2 cases of T(1)(0),(1)(1), 3 cases of T(1)(1),(1)(2), 9 cases of T(1)(2)-L(1), 4 cases of L(1),(2), 5 cases of L(2),(3), 4 cases of L(3),(4), 1 case of L(4),(5). All 28 patients received treatment of new external spinal skeletal fixation and percutaneous injury vertebra bone grafting. Operation time, intraoperative bleeding and related complications were recorded. The informations of vertebral anterior border height percentage and bone fusion were observed by radiography before and after operation, before removed external fixation and final follow-up. Visual analogue scale(VAS) was used to evaluate the clinical effects. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 13 to 32 months with an average of (24.5+/-3.5) months. There was significant difference by the time of 3 days postoperatively, before removed external fixation, final follow-up comparing with the preoperative in vertebral anterior border height percentage and VAS score(P{\textless}0.05). There was no significant difference in vertebral anterior border height percentage by the time of 3 days postoperatively, before removed external fixation comparing with final follow-up(P{\textgreater}0.05). While the VAS score showed a gradually declining trend, screw lossening ocurred in 2 cases and nail tracker infection occurred in 1 case after operation, and no other complications were found. CONCLUSIONS: New external spinal skeletal fixation and percutaneous injury vertebra bone grafting can got satisfactory clinical effect in treating two-segment thoracolumbar fractures without neural dysfunction, which is an effective method of minimally invasive surgery.},

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed for 52 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures from August 2010 to August 2015. Among them, 27 patients(group A) were treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty, including 17 males and 10 females, aged from 54 to 68 years old with an average of(61.01+/-5.41) years, 16 cases were type A3 and 11 cases were type A4 according the new AO typing. Other 25 patients (group B) were treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with injured vertebra pedicle fixation, including 12 males and 13 females, aged from 55 to 66 years old with an average of (59.28+/-6.12) years, 18 cases were type A3 and 7 cases were type A4 according the new AO typing. Operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume, complication, image data and clinical effect were compared between two groups. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 12 to 15 months with an average of (12.4+/-2.1)months. There was no significant difference in general data(including gender, age, injured site, preoperative VAS score, Cobb angle, injured vertebral anterior border height) between two groups. There was no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume between two groups. Preoperative, one week after operation and final follow-up, VAS scores were 5.2+/-0.5, 1.2+/-0.2, 0.8+/-0.1 respectively in group A and 5.0+/-0.6, 2.5+/-0.4, 1.3+/-0.2 in group B; injured vertebral anterior border height were (49.4+/-6.8){\%}, ( 94.5+/-1.2){\%}, ( 94.1+/-3.7){\%} respectively in group A and (48.2+/-7.0){\%}, ( 94.3+/-4.1){\%}, ( 90.0+/-2.3){\%} in group B;Cobb angles were (20.4+/-5.2) degrees , (2.5+/-1.8) degrees , (4.4+/-1.7) degrees respectively in group A and (19.8+/-6.8) degrees , (2.4+/-1.7) degrees , (7.0+/-1.2) degrees in group B. At final follow-up, VAS, Cobb angle, injured vertebral anterior border height in two groups were obviously improved(P{\textless}0.05). Postoperative at 1 week and final follow-up, VAS score of group A was lower than that of group B(P{\textless}0.05);and there was no significant difference in Cobb angle between two groups(P{\textgreater}0.05); there was significant difference in injured vertebral anterior border height between two groups(P{\textless}0.05). The complication of internal fixation failure had 1 case in group A and 4 cases in group B. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of single osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures, short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty is better than combined with injured vertebra pedicle fixation in clinical effect, it can relieve pain, maintain injured vertebral height and sagittal alinement, reduce the complications associated with internal fixation, and be worth spread in clinic.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 22 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures of single segment treated from January 2013 to December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 12 males and 10 females, aged from 32 to 56 years old with an average of (42.4+/-8.6) years. Self-made intelligent pneumatic reset instrument was applied to 22 cases under anaesthesia reduction, and then percutaneous pedicle screw fixation was performed. Clinical features were observed and the clinical effects were evaluated by VAS, ODI, kyphotic angle (Cobb angle) and the injured vertebral anterior border height before and after operation. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up from 1 to 2.5 years with an average of 18 months. All fractures obtained bone healing, no complications such as loosening, displacement, breakage of pedicle screw and kyphosis were found. Preoperative, 1 week postoperative, and final follow-up, VAS scores of lumbar pain were 7.82+/-0.85, 3.09+/-0.92, 1.05+/-0.72;ODI scores were 84.2+/-11.2, 46.3+/-9.0, 12.2+/-4.3;Cobb angle were (16.3+/-5.4) degrees , (3.7+/-2.2) degrees , ( 5.5+/-2.6) degrees ; the injured vertebral anterior border heights were (59.5+/-7.8){\%}, (86.9+/-6.0){\%}, (83.5+/-5.5){\%}, respectively. There was significant differences in VAS, ODI scores between any two times(P{\textless}0.05). At 1 week postoperative and final follow-up, Cobb angle, injuried vertebral anterior border height were obviously improved (P{\textless}0.05), and there was no significant difference between postoperative 1 week and final follow-up (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is safe and feasible surgical technique that intelligent inflated reduction combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. It has advantage of little trauma, reliable fixation, and less complication, etc. Therefore, it is a better choice for single-segment thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {Injuries in the pelvic region in children and adolescents are very rare and often associated with a high energy trauma. Aim of this prospective multicenter study was, by analyzing the data from the TraumaRegister Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Unfallchirurgie (TR-DGU), to evaluate any correlation between the severity of pelvic fractures and resulting mortality in different age groups.These study findings are based on a large pool of data retrieved from the prospectively-setup pelvic trauma registry established by the German Trauma Society (DGU) and the German Section of the Association for Osteosynthesis/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) International in 1991. The registry provides data on all patients suffering pelvic fractures within a 14-year time frame at any 1 of the 23 level 1 trauma centers contributing to the registry. The analysis covers 4 age groups ranging from 0 to 17 years, covering different factors regarding pelvic fractures and their treatment.We identified a total of 9684 patients including 1433 pelvic fractures in children aged {\textless}/=17 years. Those patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to the patients' age (groups A-D) and according to the fracture severity (group 1 = Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score pelvis {\textless}/=2, and group 2 = AIS pelvis {\textgreater}/=3). The mortality in group 1 was 8.8{\%} with a RISC (Revised Injury Severity Score) II of 8.6{\%}, standard mortality rate (SMR) of 1.02 and 7.2{\%} in group 2 with an RISC II of 9.9{\%} (SMR 0.73). In pelvic factures of Type A (Tile classification of pelvic fractures), an SMR of 0.76 was recorded, in Type B fractures the SMR was 0.65, and in Type C fractures 0.79. Severe pelvic injuries (AIS pelvis {\textgreater}/=2) were associated with a higher rate of whole body computer tomograph (CT) scans (1-5 years: 80{\%}, 6-10 years 81.8{\%}, 11-14 years 84.7{\%}, and 15-17 years 85.6{\%}). The rate of pelvic surgery rose with the pelvic injury's severity (AIS 2: 7.6{\%}, AIS 3: 35{\%}, AIS 4: 65.6{\%}, AIS 5 61.5{\%}). We observed higher rates of preclinical and initial clinical hypotension defined as Riva-Rocci (RR) {\textless}90 mmHG) as well as of preclinical fluid application in all age groups. The presence of a pelvic injury was associated with a higher rate of severe abdominal injuries with an AIS of {\textgreater}/=3 (25.1{\%} vs. 14.6{\%}) and of severe thorax injuries with an AIS{\textgreater}/=3 (43.6{\%} vs. 28.6{\%}).We have been able to analyze an enormous number of pelvic fractures in children and adolescents including different age groups by relying on data from the TR-DGU. Mortality seems to be associated with the severity of the pelvic injury, but is lower than the RISC II score's prognosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe coronal imaging changes associated with recollapse of injured vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic thoracolumbar fracture (OTLF). METHODS: Fifty-four cases were retrospectively divided into 2 groups according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) classification of thoracolumbar fracture: group A, type A1 fracture (n = 26); group B, type A3.1 fracture (n = 28). Visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, local scoliotic Cobb angle, and coronal wedge angle of the injured vertebrae were observed preoperatively, on postoperative day 3, and at final follow-up. RESULTS: The average follow-up time was 19.17 +/- 6.30 months. At final follow-up, the visual analog scale score and the Oswestry Disability Index score were significantly greater in group B than in group A (both P {\textless} 0.05). At final follow-up, loss of correction of scoliotic Cobb angle and coronal wedge angle was significantly higher in group B than in group A (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty was effective in both type A1 and type A3.1 OTLF. However, coronal imaging changes after percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty were more obvious in type A3.1 OTLF than in type A1. Moreover, clinical outcomes in type A3.1 OTLF were slightly inferior to those in type A1.},

abstract = {Aims: This study aimed to analyze the correlation between transverse process (TP) fractures of the fourth (L4) and fifth (L5) lumbar vertebrae and biomechanical and haemodynamic stability in patients with a pelvic ring injury, since previous data are inconsistent. Patients and Methods: The study is a retrospective matched-pair analysis of patients with a pelvic fracture according to the modified Tile AO Muller and the Young and Burgess classification who presented to a level 1 trauma centre between January 2005 and December 2014. Results: A total of 728 patients with pelvic ring injuries were included, of whom 183 (25.1{\%}) had a biomechanically unstable pelvic fracture. Of these patients, 84 (45.9{\%}) had a fracture of a TP of L4 and/or L5. A total of 73 patients (13.4{\%}) with a stable pelvic ring injury (p {\textless} 0.001) had a fracture of a TP. Patients with a fracture of a TP of L4 and/or L5 had a 5.5-fold risk (odds ratio (OR)) of having a biomechanically unstable pelvic injury. TP fractures (OR 1.6, p = 0.2) could not be confirmed as an independent predictor of haemodynamic instability. Conclusion: This is the first study that has demonstrated a positive correlation between a TP fracture of L4 and/or L5 and a biomechanically unstable pelvic ring injury. The presence of transverse process fractures of L4 and/or L5 indicates increased severity of pelvic injury and therefore can help in the planning of emergency treatment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness between percutaneous and open pedicle screw fixation without fusion for treating type A3 and A4 thoracolumbar fractures. Traumatic thoracolumbar burst fracture is a common pathology without a consensus on the best treatment approach. Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been recently introduced in the treatment of spinal fractures to reduce the adverse effects associated with the conventional open approaches, such as iatrogenic muscle denervation and pain. METHODS: A prospective analysis was made to evaluate consecutive 46 patients with type A3 and A4 thoracolumbar fractures. Patients were divided into a percutaneous pedicle screw fixation group (PPSF) and an open pedicle screw fixation group (OPSF). The mean age of patients in PPSF group (12 men, 11 woman) was 49.9 years and in OPSF group (10 men, 13 women) 52.2 years. For the purpose of evaluation, the radiological assessment of the bisegmental Cobb angle, the loss of correction, the volume of blood loss, operation time, cumulative radiation time and dose were recorded and compared. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12 months. There were no significant differences between OPSF and PPSF in the Cobb angle preoperative and postoperative angle and the loss of bisegmental correction. In PPSF group, the mean preoperative Cobb angle was 10.9 degrees and improved by 4.5 degrees postoperatively, and in OPSF group the preoperative angle was 12.1 degrees and postoperatively improved by 3.8 degrees . Significant differences between OPSF and PPSF were found in the mean cumulative radiation time, radiation dose and operation time. PPSF group also had a significantly lower perioperative blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: Both open and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation were safe and effective methods to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures. Percutaneous fixation without fusion seems to be suitable for type A3 and A4 fractures.},

abstract = {Objective Cortical bone trajectory pedicle screws (CBT) have a different trajectory compared to traditional pedicle screws (PS) and they may confer biomechanical advantages in some patient populations. We hypothesize that the placement of CBT in traumatic thoracolumbar fractures could be an alternative technique to the traditional utilization of PS. Methods Single surgeon, retrospective study was performed at a Level 1 Trauma Center from 2013 to 2017. All patients aged between 18 and 90 years with operative AO classification A, B, and C traumatic thoracolumbar fractures were included. Patients with pathological fractures, active spinal infections, or history of vertebral augmentation were excluded. Age, injury severity score (ISS), AO classification, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), and presence of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) or construct failure were compared between CBT and PS groups. The PS group was further separated into open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and minimally invasive spine (MIS) groups. All CBT and ORIF cases were completed via open incisions allowing arthrodesis of the involved lamina and facet joints whereas no arthrodesis was completed in the MIS patients. Choice of technique was at the attending surgeon's discretion. Results The study included 71 patients, out of which 12 received CBT and 59 received PS. Of the 59 PS patients, 39 were ORIF and 20 were MIS. The average operative time was 22.9 minutes less in CBT compared to ORIF (p = 0.24). EBL was 337.50 mL for CBT, 184.33 mL for MIS, and 503.33 mL for ORIF (p = 0.01) demonstrating that MIS technique results in a significantly reduced blood loss. However, EBL was comparable for CBT versus MIS (p {\textgreater} 0.05). ISS was not significantly different between the three groups (p = 0.89). LOS was 4.06 days fewer for CBT patients compared to ORIF patients (p = 0.36). There was one case of construct failure as well as one case of incisional site infection in the PS group, but none were found in the CBT group. Instances of PJK complications were determined by the change in the Cobb angle over time and they were not statistically different between the three groups (p = 0.68). Conclusions CBT is noninferior to PS in the fixation of unstable adult traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. With the exception of EBL, CBT was not statistically different compared to MIS and ORIF. This study establishes a precedent to expand the application of this new technique and investigate with larger sample sizes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the novel polymethyl methacrylate-augmented bone cement-injectable cannulated pedicle screw (CICPS) in patients with thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures (AO type A) associated with osteoporosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 28 patients treated for osteoporosis-related thoracolumbar vertebral body compression fracture at our facility between 2011 and 2015. Treatment involved posterior thoracolumbar fusion or lumbar fusion using CICPS. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated using visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores, degree of fracture reduction, and correction of kyphosis. The safety of CICPS was mainly assessed in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: All 28 patients had severe osteoporosis. The visual analog scale score at final follow-up (0.50 +/- 0.69) was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) lower compared with before surgery (4.93 +/- 1.30). The Oswestry Disability Index score had also decreased from 57.39{\%} +/- 14.46{\%} to 6.83{\%} +/- 15.38{\%} at final follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001). Radiologic evaluation of vertebral height and Cobb angle showed good fracture reduction and satisfactory correction of kyphosis (preoperative vs. final follow-up, P {\textless} 0.001). There were no instances of screw loosening or symptomatic complications except for a few cases of cement leakage from CICPS (10.3{\%}; cement leakage most common in AO type A3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of CICPS and polymethyl methacrylate is an effective and safe surgical technique for management of osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures (AO type A), with good clinical outcomes and low complications rates.},

We compared range of motion (ROM), von Mises stresses on the implants, and stress on the intervertebral discs superior and inferior to the injured vertebra during simulated spinal movements.There were no significant differences in ROM, von Mises stress, or intervertebral disc stress among the 4 intermediate pedicle screw fixation techniques for all spinal movements evaluated. In addition, there were no consolidated trends depicting beneficial differences between the short and long screw models, or between the unilateral and bilateral screw models.ROM, von Mises stress, and intervertebral disc stress are the same across the 4, posterior short-segment fixation techniques evaluated using finite element models.

abstract = {Objective: To discuss the security and effectiveness of fixing the unstable region of sagittal injured unit symmetrically with pedicle screws combined with bone graft fusion for treating thoracolumbar fractures. Methods: A series of 65 patients with a single level thoracolumbar fracture between November 2011 and November 2015 were included in the study. There were 41 males and 24 females with an average age of 36.7 years (range, 23-60 years). The fracture segments included T 7 1 case, T 9 in 2 cases, T 10 in 4 cases, T 11 in 8 cases, T 12 in 14 cases, L 1 in 19 cases, L 2 in 13 cases, L 3 in 3 cases, and L 4 in 1 case. According to AO classification, there were 34 cases classified as type A, 27 cases type B, and 4 cases type C. The neurological function was evaluated by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade score, there were 1 case at grade A, 2 cases grade B, 6 cases grade C, 15 cases grade D, and 41 cases grade E. The thoracolumbar injury severity score (TLICS) was 4 in 9 cases, 5 in 29 cases, 6-8 in 23 cases, 9-10 in 4 cases. The time form injury to operation was 2-12 days (mean, 5.3 days). The fractured vertebra, along with the superior and inferior discs were defined as a injured unit and divided into three parts on the sagittal position: region mainly including the superior disc, cephalic 1/3 of injured vertebra, and posterior ligamentous complex as to oppose; region mainly including the middle 1/3 of injured vertebra, pedicles, lamina, spinous process, and supraspinal ligament; region mainly including the inferior disc, caudal 1/3 of injured vertebra, and posterior ligamentous complex as to oppose. The unstable region was defined as the key injured region of the vertebra. Pedicle screws were fixed symmetrically and correspondingly with bone grafting to treat thoracolumbar fractures. The neurological status, ratio of anterior body height, and sagittal Cobb angle were collected at preoperation, immediate after operation, and last follow-up to evaluate surgical and clinical outcomes. Results: All patients accepted operation safely and were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 17.3 months). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 3 patients, and cured by symptomatic treatment. There was no complications such as loosening, displacement, and breakage of internal fixator. Bony fusion was achieved in all patients at 10-13 months (mean, 11.4 months) after operation. At last follow-up, according to ASIA grading, 1 case was grade A, 1 grade B, 3 grade C, 9 grade D, and 51 grade E, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative data ( Z=-2.963, P=0.014). The ratio of anterior body height at preoperation, immediate after operation, and last follow-up were 53.2{\%}+/-6.8{\%}, 91.3{\%}+/-8.3{\%}, 89.5{\%}+/-6.6{\%} respectively; and the sagittal Cobb angle were (16.3+/-8.1), (2.6+/-7.5), (3.2+/-6.8) degrees respectively. The ratio of anterior body height and the sagittal Cobb angle at immediate after operation and at last follow-up were significantly improved when compared with preoperative values ( P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found between at immediate after operation and at last follow-up ( P{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: It is safe and reliable to treat thoracolumbar fractures under the principle of fixing the unstable region of injured unit symmetrically with pedicle screws combined with bone grafting.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We have introduced a method of modified posterior short-segment pedicle  screw fixation and evaluated its clinical effects in treating lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficits. METHODS: The data from 22 patients with lumbar burst fracture and incomplete neurological deficits who had undergone modified posterior short-segment instrumentation with Schanz screw fixation from January 2012 to February 2018 in our clinic were evaluated in the present retrospective study. All Schanz screws were implanted in an oblique downward direction into the vertebrae above and below the injured vertebra (insertion depth, 90{\%}-100{\%}). The implants were removed approximately 1 year after surgery. Neurological function, back pain, anterior and posterior body height ratio, kyphosis angle, percentage of canal compromise, fracture severity, and treatment-related complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all 22 patients. No infection, instrument loosening or failure, or breakage was observed. Statistically significant improvements with regard to the anterior body height (P {\textless} 0.05) and posterior body height (P {\textless} 0.05) ratios, kyphosis angle, and percentage of canal compromise (P {\textless} 0.05) were observed at 1 week postoperatively or the final follow-up visit. No correction loss had occurred at the final follow-up examination. Postoperatively, all patients with neurological deficits had functional improvement equivalent to {\textgreater}/=1 grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale and fracture union. Back pain was greatly improved postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment Schanz screw fixation implanted in an oblique downward direction seems to be a promising method for lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficits because it provided good clinical and radiographic outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether radiographic findings associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures could be predictors of failure of short-segment posterior instrumentation with insertion screw at the fracture level (SSPI-f). METHODS: Seventy-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture surgically treated by SSPI-f were enrolled in the study and divided into 2 groups: a reduction group (n = 46) and a failed-reduction group (n = 29). Radiographic data including local kyphosis, Cobb angle, anterior vertebral height, posterior vertebral height (PVH), anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, interpedicle distance (IPD), bony compress area, bony fracture area, and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra and clinical data including age and neurologic function were also analyzed. t test, Pearson chi(2) test, and binary logistic regression were performed to compare the values. RESULTS: The PVH in the failed-reduction group was smaller than that of the reduction group (83.5{\%} +/- 7.2{\%} and 89.1{\%} +/- 5.4{\%}, respectively) (P = 0.001). The IPD differed between the reduction and failed-reduction group (18.0{\%} +/- 4.1{\%} and 25.8{\%} +/- 7.1{\%}, respectively) (P {\textless} 0.001). There was a statistical difference between the 2 groups in delayed time before surgery (P = 0.008). There was a significant difference of bony fracture area and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra between the failed-reduction and reduction group (both P {\textless} 0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that IPD was a risk factor of reduction failure of SSPI-f (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that increased IPD was a risk factor of failed-reduction of SSPI-f in managing thoracolumbar burst fractures, particularly for patients with neurologic deficit, whereas local kyphosis, Cobb angle, anterior vertebral height, PVH, anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, bony compress area, bony fracture area, and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra were not.},

To assess the surgical results in terms of pain and quality of life in a series of neurologically intact patients affected by TLJBF who underwent surgery after 3-4 months from the injury. In literature there is controversy if pain could be an indication for surgery in TLJBF and series of patients conservatively managed with success have been reported. Methods: A retrospective study on 18 patients is reported. Patients included in this series were neurologically intact and affected by a TLJBF A3 or A4 at CT scan, the height of the burst vertebral body was {\textgreater}50{\%}, spinal canal invasion was {\textless}30{\%} and kyphosis deformity {\textless}30 degrees. Pain and quality of life were evaluated using graphic rating scale (GRS) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) scores on admission, at the clinical follow-up and in post-surgical period. Results: Comparing pre- and post-operative EQ-5D, the scores had a statistically significant decrease after the operation (P{\textless}0.001) [pre-surgery EQ-5D was 2.60 (SD =0.67), post-surgery EQ-5D was 1.37 (SD =0.41)]. Also analyzing the EQ5D-VAS scores, the t-test revealed that surgery (P{\textless}0.01) improved the quality of life with statistically significance (EQ5D-VAS pre =43.89, SD =12.43 and EQ5D-VAS post =73.33, SD =10.84). Analyzing pre- and post-surgical GRS scores, the pain decreased significantly with the maximum mean difference among the 2nd and 3rd month before surgery and at 12 months after surgery (respectively D =5.444, P{\textless}0.001 and D =5.167, P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: Conservatively managed patients affected by TLJBF require a strict clinical follow-up since pain sometimes is present in the following months and it affects the quality of life. Surgery should be considered for these cases.},

abstract = {Background: Burst fractures of the lumbar vertebrae and laminar fractures associated with dural tears and entrapment of neural elements have been reported in the past as a relatively rare occurrence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no consensus on the approach to repairing these types of fractures. The objective of this study is to describe a method of repair for traumatic burst fractures of the lumbar spine and vertical laminar fractures associated with entrapped neural elements. Methods: Seventeen patients with lumbar burst fractures were treated from June 2015 through April 2017. Dural tear was detected in all cases included in this study (confirmed intra-operatively). All other burst fractures were excluded. In all cases, unilateral posterior fixation was performed with no distraction initially. The spinal canal was then decompressed; and the entrapped neural elements released. Formal distraction was performed after canal decompression to allow for ligamentotaxis, followed by reduction of the retropulsed fractured segments back into the vertebral body. Results: Using this method we achieved satisfactory results in that none of the patients had further deterioration of neurological deficit and the fixation allowed for early mobilization. Continued improvement was seen at the time of follow up for each of the studied patients with improved neurology, pain and no CSF leak. Conclusions: Our institution has demonstrated successful use of a posterior instrumentation, spinal canal decompression, release of entrapped nerve roots, and reduction of the retropulsed segment, in patients with traumatic burst fracture of the lumbar vertebrae complicated by entrapped neural elements.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To introduce our technique and results of retropleural/peritoneal lateral pediculectomy for the decompression of thoracolumbar fractures and reconstruction using an expandable titanium cage and circumferential fixation at a single stage. METHODS: Eighteen patients who had single unstable, burst thoracolumbar fracture were treated by this technique between January 2014 and December 2016 (T12: n = 9, L1: n = 7, L2: n = 2). They were reviewed retrospectively in terms of radiologic outcomes (computed tomography [CT] scan and radiograph), clinical outcomes, and complications. The results were compared with another cohort of thoracolumbar fractures treated by posterior-only surgery. RESULTS: There were no radiologic complications implying pseudoarthrosis or instrument failure on the postoperative 6-month CT scan. There was also no neurologic deterioration or infection during the same period. Two patients (11.1{\%}) of iatrogenic injury and 1 patient of trauma-related injury of the dura were secured without any delayed complications. Three patients (16.7{\%}) with transient weakness in left hip flexion immediately after operation were observed and recovered within 2 weeks in all cases. Six patients (33.3{\%}) complained of dysesthesia and/or hypoesthesia on the incision site. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we suggest lateral pediculectomy as a distinct anatomic landmark to access and remove bony fragments effectively and safely in unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. This provides a more straightforward access to the burst fragment and helps the surgeon to make better intraoperative decompression strategies. Moreover, this circumferential instrumentation with anterior support and fusion revealed better restoration of the thoracolumbar spine alignment compared with posterior-only surgery, with acceptable complications rates.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive case series study. PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency, bone pattern, and associated lesions to the spine of gunshot wounds. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Gunshot wounds are penetrating in nature and are caused by a bullet or projectile. These are becoming more common and are associated with significant sequelae, requiring long and costly multidisciplinary treatment. Associated spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in the civilian population represent 13{\%}-17{\%} of all spinal traumas. Spinal gunshot wounds are commonly thought to be stable; however, there is potential acute and chronic spinal instability if the bullet passes transversely, fracturing either both pedicles or both facet joints. METHODS: We obtained data from the clinical files of patients with spinal gunshot wounds treated by spine surgeons. We performed a statistical analysis to obtain the pattern and frequency of the injuries. RESULTS: We included 54 patients (48 men [89{\%}] and six women [11{\%}]). Eight patterns of spinal gunshot wounds were identified; 61{\%} (33 patients) had complete SCI. The thoracic spine was most frequently affected, with 88{\%} of patients having SCI; 75{\%}, hemopneumothorax; 28{\%}, pulmonary lesions; and 16{\%}, hepatic lesions. The presence of pedicle fractures had an odds ratio of 3.64 for SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The two main bone patterns are the vertebral body and posterior arch with pedicle fractures as modifiers, given that they are at a high risk for SCI. The spinal pattern and associated lesions were related to the bullet's path, with the vertebral body having the highest frequency of associated lesions. Vertebral body burst fracture was the main indication for instrumentation.},

abstract = {The best tissue-engineered spinal cord grafts not only match the structural characteristics of the spinal cord but also allow the seed cells to grow and function in situ. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been shown to promote the migration of bone marrow stromal cells; however, cytokines need to be released at a steady rate to maintain a stable concentration in vivo. Therefore, new methods are needed to maintain an optimal concentration of cytokines over an extended period of time to effectively promote seed cell localization, proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, a partition-type tubular scaffold matching the anatomical features of the thoracic 8-10 spinal cord of the rat was fabricated using chitosan and then subsequently loaded with chitosan-encapsulated PDGF-BB microspheres (PDGF-MSs). The PDGF-MS-containing scaffold was then examined in vitro for sustained-release capacity, biocompatibility, and its effect on neural progenitor cells differentiated in vitro from multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells (MUSE-NPCs). We found that pre-freezing for 2 hours at -20 degrees C significantly increased the yield of partition-type tubular scaffolds, and 30 muL of 25{\%} glutaraldehyde ensured optimal crosslinking of PDGF-MSs. The resulting PDGF-MSs cumulatively released 52{\%} of the PDGF-BB at 4 weeks in vitro without burst release. The PDGF-MS-containing tubular scaffold showed suitable biocompatibility towards MUSE-NPCs and could promote the directional migration and growth of these cells. These findings indicate that the combination of a partition-type tubular scaffold, PDGF-MSs and MUSE-NPCs may be a promising model for the fabrication of tissue-engineered spinal cord grafts.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment of unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in the elderly population is highly variable with combined posterior and anterior stabilization (CPAS) and posterior augmented stabilization with cementation of the vertebral body (hybrid) being two commonly used techniques. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of CPAS versus hybrid stabilization for the treatment of unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in patients aged between 60 and 70 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all thoracolumbar burst fractures treated surgically in a single level I trauma center between June 2013 and February 2015. Two commonly used strategies of surgical stabilization were compared; the first consisted of initial posterior reduction and bisegmental stabilization, followed by additional anterior spondylodesis (CPAS); the second method comprised a hybrid technique with a posterior cement augmented bisegmental minimally invasive stabilization and kyphoplasty of the fractured vertebral body. Patients were evaluated clinically after a minimum follow-up of 18 months. The primary endpoint was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at the latest follow-up. Secondary parameters of interest were length of in-hospital stay (LIHS), duration of surgery (DS), surgical revisions (SR), pain level (P-VAS), satisfaction level and the SF-36 score (PSC, MSC), the bisegmental postoperative Cobb angle, the reduction loss (RL), and all alignment parameters (pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence, sacral slope, lumbar lordosis, C7 plumb line). RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included (17 females, 12 males, mean age 65.6 years +/- 3.4 years). The following vertebral bodies were fractured: thoracic level (T) 12: n = 6; lumbar (L) 1: n = 14; L 2: n = 6; L 3: n = 3. CPAS was performed in 10 patients (34{\%}), whereas the hybrid was carried out in 19 patients (66{\%}). There were no statistical significant differences between both study groups regarding age, gender, trauma energy, fracture level, and fracture morphology. The latest follow-up was performed after a mean of 27 months (range 18-53 months). The LIHS between the treatment methods was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01); CPAS-mean 24 days versus hybrid-mean 12 days. DS was also significantly longer in patients treated with CPAS, 254 versus 95 min for the hybrid group (p {\textless} 0.01). No SR were necessary in either group. No significant differences were found regarding the clinical and radiological outcomes between the groups. The mean ODI score was 13.6 in the CPAS patients compared to 10.8 in the hybrid patients without significant differences between the groups. The majority of patients had no (80{\%}) or minor (13{\%}) limitations according to the ODI score. The P-VAS was 2.8 in CPAS and 2.9 in the hybrid group. RL was 7.1 degrees in CPAS and 4.2 degrees in the hybrid group. CONCLUSIONS: CPAS and hybrid stabilization provide safe and promising short- and middle-term results in patients between 60 and 70 years of age. The majority of patients demonstrated no disability or minimal limitations with either technique. CPAS resulted in prolonged inpatient hospital stays, longer duration of surgery compared to hybrid stabilization without significant differences in clinical and radiological outcome.},

We sought to investigate lower extremity ischemia in patients who received REBOA. Between February 2013 and September 2016 patients at a tertiary center that received REBOA and survived more than six hours were enrolled. Thirty-one patients were identified, the mean ISS was 40 +/- 14 and inhospital mortality was 39 per cent. Twenty received REBOA in zone 1 (distal thoracic aorta). Three (15{\%}) developed lower extremity compartment syndrome (LECS) after zone 1 REBOA. Injury of iliofemoral arteries and veins was each associated with calf fasciotomies (both P = 0.005). A longer duration of AO at zone 1 was associated with calf and thigh fasciotomy (P = 0.046 and P = 0.048, respectively). Iliofemoral arterial injury was associated with thigh fasciotomy (P = 0.04). Eleven patients received REBOA in zone 3 (distal abdominal aorta). Five (45{\%}) patients underwent fasciotomy; four (36{\%}) due to LECS. Femoral arterial injury was associated with calf fasciotomies (P = 0.02). There was no association with sheath size or laterality and need for fasciotomy. Neither groin access for REBOA or AO solely caused limb loss or LECS. The contribution to distal ischemia by REBOA remains unclear in patients with lower extremity injury.},

abstract = {Intermediate screw fixation at the fracture level has been widely accepted to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures, but no study has shown the effect of the extent and location of fixation. The effect of the extent and location of fixation on short- or long-segment pedicle screw fixation through intermediate screw fixation at the fracture level in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is discussed.Posterior intermediate screw fixation techniques in treating T12 vertebral fracture models were simulated and compared using finite element methods; the fixation techniques included M3-L1 (bilateral 3 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L1 to T11), M3-L2, M4-L1 (bilateral 4 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L1 to T10), M4-L2, M4-L3, and M5-L2 (bilateral 5 monoaxial pedicle screw fixation from L2 to T10). Range of motion (ROM) and largest von Mises stress (LVMS) of the instrumentations were recorded and analyzed.No significant differences were observed in the mean ROM of all states of motion between the M3-L1 model and the other fixation models except for M5-L2. The LVMS of the pedicle screws and rods all occurred during flexion. The LVMS values of the pedicle screws were larger in the M3-L2 fixation model and M4-L3 fixation model than in the other fixation models. The M3-L1 model presented a significantly smaller mean LVMS of the pedicle screws in all states of motion than the M3-L2 model (P = .026). The LVMS values of the rods were larger in the M3-L2 fixation model, M4-L3 fixation model, and M4-L2 fixation model than in the other fixation models. No significant differences were observed in the mean LVMS of the rods in all states of motion among all the fixation models.When choosing short-segment pedicle screw fixation with the screwing of fractured vertebrae to treat thoracolumbar fractures, we suggest M3-L1 over M3-L2. More severe injuries can be considered to identify an alternative treatment to long-segment monoaxial pedicle fixation constructs such as the M4-L1 and M5-L2 techniques.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To correlate interpedicular distance (IPD) with radiographic parameters, neurologic deficit, and posterior structures injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: A total of 103 patients with a thoracolumbar burst fracture retrospectively reviewed. IPD was measured from the medial sclerotic areas of the pedicles on anteroposterior plain radiographs. Data on local kyphosis (LK), the ratio of anterior to posterior vertebral height (A/P ratio), loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), spinal canal stenosis (SCS), neurologic status, and injuries to posterior structures (lamina, posterior ligamentous complex, and facet joint) were correlated with IPD using correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the threshold of IPD predictive of neurologic deficit and posterior structure injury. RESULTS: Of the 103 patients, 98 (95.15{\%}) presented with increased IPD, ranging from 1.41{\%} to 41.53{\%} (mean, 10.92 +/- 3.37{\%}). Regarding radiographic parameters, both LK and SCS were linearly correlated with IPD. There was a significant correlation between IPD and neurologic status; logistic regression analysis identified an IPD increase of {\textgreater}20{\%} as an indicator of neurologic deficit. In addition, both facet joint injury and lamina fracture were associated with IPD, with an IPD increase {\textgreater}15{\%} as an indicator of facet joint injury and an IPD increase {\textgreater}20{\%} a predictor of lamina fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPD is correlated with LK, SCS, neurologic status, facet joint injury, and lamina fracture. Our data demonstrate that IPD measured from plain radiographs is a reliable indicator for assessment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims in the management of thoracolumbar spinal fractures are not only to restore vertebral column stability, but also to obtain acceptable alignment of the thoracolumbar junction (T-L junction) to prevent complications. However, insufficient surgical correction of the thoracolumbar spine would be likely to cause late progression of abnormal kyphosis. Therefore, we identified the surgical factors that affected unfavorable radiologic outcomes of the thoracolumbar spine after surgery. METHODS: This study was conducted in a single institution from January 2007 to December 2013. A total of 98 patients with unstable thoracolumbar spine fracture were included. In these patients, fixation was done through transpedicular screws with rods by three surgical patterns. We reviewed digital radiographs and analyzed the images preoperatively and postoperatively during follow-up visits to compare the change of the thoracolumbar Cobb angle with radiologic parameters and clinical outcomes. The unfavorable radiologic group was defined as the patients who were measured as having greater than 20 degrees of thoracolumbar Cobb angle on the last follow-up, or who underwent kyphotic progression of thoracolumbar Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees from the immediate postoperative state to final follow-up, or who had overt instrument failure with/without additional surgery. We assessed the risk factors that affected the unfavorable radiologic outcomes. RESULTS: We had 43 patients with unfavorable radiologic outcomes, including 35 abnormal thoracolumbar alignments and 14 instrumental failures with/without additional surgery. The multivariate logistic regression test showed that immediate postoperative T-L junction Cobb angle less than 10.5 degrees was a statistically significant risk factor, as well as the presence of osteoporosis (p=0.017 and 0.049, respectively). CONCLUSION: Insufficient correction of thoracolumbar kyphosis was considered to be a major factor of an unfavorable radiological outcome. The spinal surgeon should consider that having a T-L junction Cobb angle larger than 10.5 degrees immediately after surgery could result in an unfavorable radiological outcome, which is related to a poor clinical outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGORUND: This study aimed to compare the accuracy of screw placement between open pedicle screw fixation and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (MIS) for the treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures (TSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with acute TSF who were treated with transpedicular screw fixation from January 2013 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into Open and MIS groups. Laminectomy was performed in either group if needed. The accuracy of the screw placement, the evolution of the Cobb sagital angle postoperatively and at 12-month follow up and the neurological status were recorded. AO type of fracture and TLICS score were also recorded. RESULTS: Mean age was 42 years old. Mean TLICS score was 6,29 and 5,96 for open and MIS groups respectively. Twenty five MIS and 24 open surgeries were performed, and 350 (175 in each group) screws were inserted (7,14 per patient). Twenty-four and 13 screws were considered out in the open and MIS groups respectively (Odds ratio 1,98. 0,97-4,03 p=0,056). The Cobb sagittal angle went from 13,3o to 4,5o and from 14,9o to 8,2o in the Open and MIS groups respectively (both p{\textless}0,0001). Loss of correction at 12-month follow up was 3,2o and 4,2o for the open and MIS groups respectively. No neurological worsening was observed. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of acute thoracolumbar fractures, the MIS technique seems to achieve similar results to the open technique in relation to neurological improvement and deformity correction, while placing the screws more accurately.},

Methods We evaluated 20 elderly patients (age, 60-89 years; mean, 73.2 years) with osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures and neurological deficits. They underwent short-segment decompression and fixation and followed up for 40.6 (range, 24-68) months. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to measure back pain and disability. We also analyzed patients' radiologic findings and neurological status. Perioperative and postoperative complications were recorded. Results At the latest follow-up, the average VAS score for back pain and ODI scores had significantly improved. The radiologic assessment showed significant improvements in local kyphosis, anterior vertebral height, and the vertebral wedge angle compared with the original measures. Neurological function also improved in 18 of 20 patients. No major complications occurred perioperatively. Our techniques included preservation of the posterior ligament complex, decortication of facet joints for fusion, no tapping to increase the screw insertional torque, pre-contouring of the rods according to the "adaptive" curve obtained from postural reduction, and postoperative spinal bracing. Conclusions Posterior short-segment decompression and fixation could be an effective surgical option for osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures with neurological deficits.},

abstract = {One-lung ventilation in thoracic surgery provokes profound systemic inflammatory  responses and injury related to lung tidal volume changes. We hypothesized that the highly selective a2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine attenuates these injurious responses. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine or saline during thoracoscopic surgery. There is a trend of less postoperative medical complication including that no patients in the dexmedetomidine group developed postoperative medical complications, whereas four patients in the saline group did (0{\%} versus 13.3{\%}, p = 0.1124). Plasma inflammatory and injurious biomarkers between the baseline and after resumption of two-lung ventilation were particularly notable. The plasma high-mobility group box 1 level decreased significantly from 51.7 (58.1) to 33.9 (45.0) ng.ml(-1) (p {\textless} 0.05) in the dexmedetomidine group, which was not observed in the saline group. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [151.8 (115.1) to 235.2 (186.9) pg.ml(-1), p {\textless} 0.05] and neutrophil elastase [350.8 (154.5) to 421.9 (106.1) ng.ml(-1), p {\textless} 0.05] increased significantly only in the saline group. In addition, plasma interleukin-6 was higher in the saline group than in the dexmedetomidine group at postoperative day 1 [118.8 (68.8) versus 78.5 (58.8) pg.ml(-1), p = 0.0271]. We conclude that dexmedetomidine attenuates one-lung ventilation-associated inflammatory and injurious responses by inhibiting alveolar neutrophil recruitment in thoracoscopic surgery.},

abstract = {Introduction: Spinopelvic dissociation injuries are historically treated with open reduction with or without decompressive laminectomy. Recent technological advances have allowed for percutaneous fixation with indirect reduction. Herein, we evaluate outcomes and complications between patients treated with open reduction versus percutaneous spinopelvic fixation. Methods: Retrospective review of patients undergoing spinopelvic fixation from a single, level one trauma center from 2012 to 2017. Patient information regarding demographics, associated injuries, and treatment outcome measures was recorded and analyzed. All fractures were classified via the AO Spine classification system. Results: Thirty-one spinopelvic dissociations were identified: 15 treated with open and 16 with percutaneous techniques. The two treatment groups had similar preoperative characteristics including spinopelvic parameters (pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis). Compared to open reduction internal fixation, percutaneous fixation of spinopelvic dissociation resulted in statistically significantly lower blood loss (171 cc versus 538 cc; p = 0.0013). There were no significant differences in surgical site infections (p = 0.48) or operating room time (p = 0.66). Conclusion: Percutaneous fixation of spinopelvic dissociation is associated with significantly less blood loss. Treatment outcomes in terms of infection, length of stay, operative cost, and final alignment between the open and percutaneous group were similar.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether surgery or nonoperative treatment has better clinical outcomes in neurologically intact patients with an intermediate severity thoracolumbar burst fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Optimal management, whether initial operative or nonoperative treatment, for thoracolumbar injury classification score (TLICS) 4 burst fractures remains controversial. Better insight into the treatment which affords patients a better clinical outcome could significantly affect patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive cases of TLICS 4 burst fracture patients from 2007 to 2013 and minimum 6-month follow-up. Potential confounders examined included age, sex, injury severity score, initial kyphotic angle, injured facets, and interspinous widening. Outcomes were determined by standardized questionnaires [Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), 12-item Short Form Physical Component Score (SF-12 PCS), and back pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS)] and analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients with burst fractures were identified, of which 67/230 (29{\%}) were TLICS 4 and 47/67 (70{\%}) had completed follow-up. No difference on univariate analysis was found between nonsurgical and surgical groups in mean ODI scores (P=0.27, t test), nor mean time to return to work (P=0.10, t test).Regarding outcomes, linear regression analysis revealed no association between having surgery and ODI (P=0.29), SF-12 PCS (P=0.59), or VAS (P=0.33). Furthermore, no difference was found between groups for employed patients working versus not working (P=0.09, the Fisher test), nor in mean time to return to work (P=0.30, Cox regression). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest studies examining TLICS 4 burst fracture patients, adjusting for both clinical and radiologic confounders and reporting patient outcomes with minimum 6-month follow-up. No differences were found in outcomes between patients treated either surgically or nonsurgically. Studies focusing on early postoperative differences or cost-effectiveness might help in decision making. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.},

METHODS: A single-center prospective cohort study was conducted to enroll patients with thoracic/thoracolumbar incomplete SCI from April 2013 to November 2016; they were divided into an early group ({\textless}24 hours after SCI) and a late group (24-72 hours after SCI). Each group was divided into A, B, C subgroups according to AOSICS. The primary outcomes were ordinal changes in ASIA Impairment Scale at 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes included the Medical outcomes study 36-term short form health survey physical component summary (PCS), complications, mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-one patients with thoracic/thoracolumbar incomplete SCI were included; 335 patients underwent early surgery, and 386 patients underwent delayed surgery. Statistical results included the following comparisons of the early versus late groups: AIS improvement of 1 grade or more (combined groups: P = 0.009, odds ratio [OR] = 1.487; A: P = 0.777, OR = 1.072; B: P = 0.029, OR = 1.701; C: P = 0.007, OR = 1.762), AIS improvement 2 grades or more (combined groups: P = 0.002, OR = 2.471; A: P = 0.189, OR = 3.939; B: P = 0.011, OR = 2.550; C: P = 0.035, OR = 3.964) and PCS (combined groups: P = 0.327; A: P = 0.776; B: P = 0.019; C: P = 0.562).

Methods: Between January 2013 and December 2015, the clinical data of 116 patients with thoracolumbar fractures treated with posterior pedicle screw-rod system reduction and internal fixation were analyzed retrospectively. There were 72 males and 44 females, aged 22-66 years (mean, 43 years). Injury causes were traffic accident in 24 cases, falling from height in 54 cases, bruise in 38 cases. Fracture segment located at T 11 in 5 cases, T 12 in 38 cases, L 1 in 52 cases, L 2 in 21 cases. There were 51 cases of compressive fracture and 65 cases of burst fracture. The sagittal Cobb angle ranged from 8 to 27 degrees , with an average of 15 degrees . Degree of preoperative spinal compression ranged from 20{\%} to 75{\%}, with an average of 44{\%}. Bone density measurement showed that normal bone mass in 30 cases, bone loss in 40 cases, osteoporosis in 41 cases, and severe osteoporosis in 5 cases. The number, pathological characteristics, and imaging regularity of the vertebral "shell" phenomenon were observed and analyzed by logistic regression. Results: All patients were followed up 11-18 months with an average of 13 months. A total of 72 cases of vertebral "shell" phenomenon mainly located in the vertebral anterior column and the end plate near the weak area (54/72, 75.0{\%}). Most of them were in the irregular shape (50/72, 69.5{\%}). The vertebral fracture line was related to the shape of the vertebral body and the displacement of the vertebral body after reduction. The outcome of the "shell" can be divided into disappeared type, reduced type, and collapse type, the volume of vertebral "shell" and its outcome were the risk factors for vertebral fracture healing. Conclusion: The incidence of vertebral "shell" and nonuion of thoracolumbar fractures after posterior reduction are high. The main influencing factors are vertebral "shell" outcome and size.},

Methods: A randomized controlled clinical research was performed between June 2015 and January 2017. Eighty-five cases of OVCF were treated with photoelectric guided navigation unilateral puncture of the PKP (trial group, 43 cases) or C arm fluoroscopy unilateral puncture of the PKP (control group, 42 cases) respectively. There was no significant difference in gender, age, disease duration, segmental fracture, AO classification, bone mineral density, and preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score between 2 groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05). The concordance rate of puncture path and design path, the incidence of pedicle wall breaking, the incidence of bone cement leakage, and the rate of bone cement distribution center were observed and calculated on postoperative CT images; the intraoperative X-ray exposure frequency, frequency of puncture, operation time, VAS scores before operation and at 2 days after operation, and postoperative blood vessel or nerve injury were recorded and compared. Results: The intraoperative X-ray exposure frequency and puncture frequency in trial group were significantly less than those in control group ( P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference in operation time between 2 groups ( t=0.440, P=0.661).

Methods: Between May 2008 and July 2013, 52 patients of severe unstable thoracolumbar fractures were treated through posterior short-segment fixation including the fractured vertebra using pedicle screw fixation. There were 33 males and 19 females with an age of 21-56 years (mean, 37.9 years). The causes of thoracolumbar burst fractures included fall from height in 32 cases, traffic accidents in 16 cases, and others in 4 cases. The load sharing classification (LSC) score was 7-9 (mean, 7.85). The levels involved included T 11 in 4 cases, T 12 in 19 cases, L 1 in 25 cases, and L 2 in 4 cases. According to Frankel classification, there were 2 cases of grade A, 4 cases of grade B, 8 cases of grade C, 11 cases of grade D, and 27 cases of grade E. The rate of spinal canal occupying was 24.2{\%}-76.7{\%} (mean, 47.1{\%}). The time from injury to operation was 3-5 days (mean, 3.6 days). The effectiveness was assessed by the changes of injured vertebral Cobb angle, anterior vertebral height, and the Frankel grading at pre- and post-operation. Results: The operation time was 85-127 minutes (mean, 106.5 minutes). The intraoperative blood loss was 90-155 mL (mean, 137.6 mL). All the incision healed at first intension. Forty-seven patients were followed up 19-27 months (mean, 23.2 months), and no incision infection, screw loosening, or other internal fixation failures was found during follow-up. The injured vertebral Cobb angle and anterior vertebral height at immediate after operation or at last follow-up were significantly improved when compared with preoperative values ( P{\textless}0.001). There was a loss of injured vertebral Cobb angle and anterior vertebral height at last follow-up, but no significant difference was found between at immediate after operation and at last follow-up ( P{\textgreater}0.05).

Methods: Ten patients receiving discectomy were collected, of which 5 patients were young with spinal burst fracture, classified as control group; the rest 5 patients were senile with lumbar disc herniation, classified as degenerative group. The nucleus pulposus tissue of 2 groups were collected, the in situexpression of beta-catenin was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan were detected by Western blot. The NPC were isolated and cultured from degenerative nucleus pulposus tissues. RES treated the third-passage NPC with (group B) or without IL-1beta (group C), to further determine the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan by Western blot, the unstimulated cells were set up as blank control group (group A). Moreover, NPC treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted silent SIRT1 or beta-catenin were used to determine the protein and gene expressions of beta-catenin and SIRT1 by Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. In addition, the third-passage NPC treated with complete medium (group 1), IL-1beta (group 2), RES+IL-1beta (group 3), and SIRT1-siRNA+RES+IL-1beta (group 4) for 24 hours were used to detect the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin by cell immunofluorescence staining. Finally, the third-passage NPC treated with complete medium (group ), IL-1beta (group ), IL-1beta+beta-catenin-siRNA (group ), IL-1beta+RES (group ), and IL-1beta+RES+SIRT1-siRNA (group ) for 24 hours were used to detect the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan by Western blot. Results: Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot detection showed that when compared with control group, the cell proportion of expression of beta-catenin were significantly increased in degenerative group ( t=4.616, P=0.010); the protein expression of beta-catenin was also significantly increased and the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan were significantly decreased ( P{\textless}0.05). In cytology experiments, the protein expression of beta-catenin in group B was significantly higher than that in groups A and C, and the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan in group B were significantly lower than those in groups A and C ( P{\textless}0.05). After transfection of siRNA, the protein expressions of SIRT1 and beta-catenin significantly decreased ( P{\textless}0.05). The results of cell immunofluorescence staining further confirmed that when compared with group 3, after the SIRT1 was silenced by siRNA in group 4, the attenuated nuclear translocation of beta-catenin by RES treatment was aggravated. Western blot results showed that the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan in group were significantly lower than those in group ( P{\textless}0.05); after transfection of beta-catenin-siRNA in group , the degradation of ECM by IL-1beta was obviously inhibited, the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan were significantly increased when compared with group ( P{\textless}0.05); after transfection of SIRT1-siRNA in group , the protective effect of RES on the degradation of ECM was inhibited, the protein expressions of collagen type and Aggrecan were significantly decreased when compared with group ( P{\textless}0.05). Conclusion: RES regulates the ECM expression of NPC via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which provide a new idea for intervertebral disc degeneration disease treatment.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of posterior microscopic mini-open technique (MOT) decompression in patients with severe spinal canal stenosis resulting from thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods: The clinical data of 28 patients with severe spinal canal stenosis caused by thoracolumbar burst fractures, who were treated by posterior microscopic MOT, which performed unilateral or bilateral laminectomy, poking reduction, intervertebral bone graft via spinal canal, and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation between January 2014 and January 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 21 males and 7 females with a mean age of 42.1 years (range, 16-61 years). The involved segments included T 11 in 1 case, T 12 in 4 cases, L 1 in 14 cases, and L 2 in 9 cases. According to AO classification, there were 19 cases of type A3, 9 of type A4. According to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grading, 12 cases were grade C, 13 grade D, and 3 grade E. The time between injury and operation was 3-7 days (mean, 3.6 days). To evaluate effectiveness, the changes in the visual analogue scale (VAS), percentage of anterior height of injured vertebrae, Cobb angle, rate of spinal compromise (RSC), and ASIA grading were analyzed. Results: All patients were performed procedures successfully. The operation time was 135-323 minutes (mean, 216.4 minutes). The intraoperative blood loss was 80-800 mL (mean, 197.7 mL). The hospitalization time was 10-25 days (mean, 12.5 days). The incisions healed primarily, without wound infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or other early complications. All the 28 patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 16.5 months). No breakage or loosening of internal fixation occurred. All fractures healed, and the healing time was 3-12 months (mean, 6.5 months). Compared with preoperative ones, the percentage of anterior height of injured vertebrae, Cobb angle, and RSC at immediate after operation and at last follow-up and the VAS scores at 1 day after operation and at last-follow were significantly improved ( P{\textless}0.05). There was no significant difference in the percentage of anterior height of injured vertebrae and Cobb angle between at immediate after operation and at last follow-up ( P{\textgreater}0.05). But the RSC at immediate after operation and VSA score at 1 day after operation were significantly improved when compared with those at last follow-up ( P{\textless}0.05). The ASIA grading at last follow-up was 1 case of grade C, 14 grade D, and 13 grade E, which was significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones ( Z=3.860, P=0.000). Conclusion: MOT is an effective and minimal invasive treatment for thoracolumbar AO type A3 and A4 burst fractures with severe spinal canal stenosis, and it is beneficial to early rehabilitation for patients.},

abstract = {AIM: To present the results of vertebroplasty for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients (aged {\textgreater}/=65 years) with thoracolumbar fractures but without neurological deficits underwent vertebroplasty. In all fracture cases, the anterior and middle columns of the vertebrae were affected and the canal was mildly compressed. To assess the clinical symptoms and the effects of the procedure, patient mobility and pain were assessed prior to the procedure and at 1 day and 3 months after the procedure. RESULTS: Improvements in pain and mobility were observed immediately after vertebroplasty in all patients. These results were observed for 3 months. Significant improvements were also noted at 1 day and 3 months after vertebroplasty. Pain was reduced by at least 4 levels after 3 months. No co-morbidities were observed. However, computed tomography revealed polymethylmethacrylate leakage through the endplate fracture site into the disc space or paravertebral space in four vertebrae and minimal intracanal leakage through the fracture line in one patient. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty is assumed to be contraindicated in patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures with posterior body involvement. However, this procedure was successfully performed to safely treat such fractures without causing neurological deficits. Percutaneous vertebroplasty may be an alternative method for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures that prevents major surgical complications. Moreover, it helps patients achieve early mobilization and pain relief.},

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 48 patients with thoracolumbar fracture who were assigned into 2 groups between June 2013 and June 2015. Control group ( n=24) received treatment with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation with allogeneic bone implanting in injured vertebra; intervention group ( n=24) received treatment with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation combining with rhBMP-2 and allogeneic bone grafting in injured vertebra. There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury cause, affected segment, vertebral compression degree, the thoracolumbar injury severity score (TLICS), Frankel grading for neurological symptoms, Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior verterbral height between 2 groups before operation ( P{\textgreater}0.05). The Cobb angle, compression rate of anterior vertebral height, intervertebral height changes, and defects in injured vertebra at last follow-up were compared between 2 groups. Results: All the patients were followed up 21-45 months (mean, 31.3 months). Bone healing was achieved in 2 groups, and there was no significant difference in healing time of fracture between intervention group [(7.6+/-0.8) months] and control group [(7.5+/-0.8) months] ( t=0.336, P=0.740). The Frankel grading of all patients were reached grade E at last follow-up. The Cobb angle and compression rate of anterior verterbral height at 1 week after operation and last follow-up were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones in 2 groups ( P{\textless}0.05). There was no significant difference in Cobb angle and compression rate of anterior verterbral height between 2 groups at 1 week after operation ( P{\textgreater}0.05), but the above indexes in intervention group were better than those in control group at last follow-up ( P{\textless}0.05). At last follow-up, there was no significant difference of intervertebral height changes of internal fixation adjacent upper position, injured vertebra adjacent upper position, injured vertebra adjacent lower position, and internal fixation adjacent lower position between 2 groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05). Defects in injured vertebra happened in 18 cases (75.0{\%}) in control group and 5 cases (20.8{\%}) in intervention group, showing significant difference ( chi(2)=14.108, P=0.000); and in patients with defects in injured vertebra, bone defect degree was 7.50{\%}+/-3.61{\%} in control group, and was 2.70{\%}+/-0.66{\%} in intervention group, showing significant difference ( t=6.026, P=0.000).

abstract = {Study Design: Case series. Objective: Thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF) are the most frequent type of spinal fractures. Approximately half of the patients are neurologically intact and their treatment is still debatable. Gender could influence outcome after surgical procedures, but this is still unclear in patients sustaining a spinal fracture. The aim of this study was to investigate how gender influences health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and disability in patients operated on for TLBF. Methods: We identified 44 neurologically intact patients from a consecutive series of patients treated surgically for a single-level traumatic burst fracture (AOSpine Subaxial Classification System A3) in the thoracolumbar transition area (Th12-L2). At 1 year after surgery, they were evaluated using the SF-36v2 questionnaire to assess HRQOL and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire to evaluate disability. Results: Male patients scored higher in each item of the SF-36v2, with significant differences (P {\textless} .05) for Physical Function (PF), Bodily Pain (BP), and Social Function (SF). Male patients also had lower disability scores. Overall ODI score had a strong correlation with Physical Function, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, Vitality, Mental Health, and overall Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 in women, but only with Physical Function, Role-Physical, Role-Emotional, and PCS in men. Conclusions: In this study, male patients reported better outcomes at 1 year after surgery for TLBF than women. Disability strongly correlated with the overall HRQOL, physical and mental health in women, but not in men. We found gender-related differences favoring men after surgical interventions for spinal fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior stabilization of the spine is associated with iatrogenic muscle damage. This is discussed to represent an important cause of postoperative pain, especially in open reduction and fixation. The aim of this study was to visualize muscular changes after open or percutaneous posterior stabilization of traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures and to investigate whether or not these changes are related to the clinical outcome. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was performed between 05/2012 and 10/2014. A group of posteriorly stabilized patients (study group; SG) with traumatic fractures (AOSpine Type A3 or A4) of the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) without neurological deficit were matched to a healthy control group (CG) by age, gender and body mass index. FOLLOW-UP: 12 months after surgery. PARAMETERS: muscle size, voluntary muscular activation (VMA) using a standardized ultrasound protocol and standardized questionnaires (VAS Spine Score; ODI; SF-36) were analyzed. STATISTICS: SPSS (Version 20, 76 Chicago, IL, USA). T test, Chi squared test, analysis of variance and a correlation analysis were performed. Significance level was at p {\textless} 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (SG) and 23 control individuals (CG) were included. At follow-up, voluntary muscular activation of the lumbar multifidus (LM) as well as the transverse abdominis muscle (TrA) was diminished in all patients compared to the control group (VMA LM at level L3/4: SG 3.2{\%}; CG 5.1{\%}; p {\textless} 0.05; VMA TrA: SG 33.43{\%}; CG 37.84{\%}; p {\textless} 0.05). Concomitant interviews revealed health restrictions in all patients when compared with the control group. A correlation between muscle function and clinical outcome could not been demonstrated (rs {\textgreater} 0.07; NS). CONCLUSION: In surgically treated A3 and A4 fractures, there is continuous muscular deficit 1 year after surgery as documented by ultrasound and clinical control. But, by means of our study we conclude that those muscular deficits alone seem not to be decisive for the clinical outcome 1 year after surgery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The posterior transpedicular approach (PTA) is a posterior approach that has the advantage of achieving circumferential arthrodesis by a single posterior-only approach. The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience with PTA in the management of pediatric traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures (TTLBFs). METHODS: Consecutive pediatric patients (age {\textless}/=18 years) with TTLBFs treated with PTA for 6 years were included in this retrospective study. Correction of kyphotic deformity and change in neurologic status were analyzed to assess outcome. The Cobb angle and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade were used for this purpose. RESULTS: There were 6 male and 8 female patients. Five patients had complete injury (ASIA-A), and 9 had incomplete injury. The mean Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity score was 6.71. The mean preoperative Cobb angle was 14.71 degrees and improved to -3.35 degrees postoperatively (mean kyphosis correction -18.05 degrees ). Two of the patients experienced iatrogenic nerve root injury. There was 1 postoperative mortality due to complications unrelated to the surgery. The mean Cobb angle was -0.07 degrees at the 32.2-month follow-up visit. Six patients experienced cage subsidence, but none required revision surgery. Postoperatively, 11 (78.5{\%}) patients showed neurologic improvement, and none experienced deterioration. The average ASIA score improved from 2.5 to 3.78. A fusion rate of 100{\%} (n = 12) was observed at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that PTA is a feasible approach in selected pediatric patients with unstable traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures, with results comparable with those in the adult population. This study demonstrates in detail the procedure, along with the neurologic and radiologic outcomes of this approach in the pediatric population.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: It is well established that traumatic spinal dislocations (AO Type C injuries) should be surgically treated. However, no recent comparative study of surgical versus non-surgical management of type C injuries was found attesting the superiority of surgical treatment. OBJECTIVE: Due to the lack of information about the natural history of non-surgical management of type C injuries, we evaluated the outcome of historical conservative treatment of type C injuries. METHODS: An extensive manual search of articles was performed in the Pubmed Database. We included articles that reported the clinical and/ or the radiological outcome of non-surgical management of thoracic and/ or lumbar spinal fracture-dislocations. RESULTS: Three well described retrospective studies where fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine were managed non-surgically were included. Non-surgical management typically consisted in postural reduction and prolonged bed rest (about 10-13 weeks on average). Residual deformity was common, and some studies reported a high rate of post treatment pain syndromes. Some studies reported surgery for gibbus deformity after conservative treatment or persistent instability requiring further bed rest. Neurological deterioration was rare, and some patients had some improvement, although the vast majority of the patients had persistent, severe neurological deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with historical non-surgical care, surgery for type C injuries decreases the chances of post-operative pain, late spinal deformity and also allowed early rehabilitation, once no bed restriction is necessary. Ethical issues based on this historical analysis may preclude performing a comparative study of non-surgical versus surgical management of these injuries in the modern spine era.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and clinical effect of posterior spinal canal decompression with pedicle screw fixation and reconstruction of anterior and middle vertebral column for thoracolumbar burst fractures complicated with nerve injury. METHODS: A total of 36 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated from March 2011 to April 2016 were enrolled in the retrospective study. There were 20 males and 16 females, aged from 21 to 52 years old with an average of 37.6 years. All the fractures were located on a single segment, 8 cases of T11(1)(1), 10 cases of T(1)(2), 12 cases of L(1), 6 cases of L(2). According to thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score(TLICS) system, the score was 7 to 9 points, with an average of 7.4 points. According to the America Spine Injury Association(ASIA) grade, 4 cases were type A, 10 cases were type B, 14 cases were type C, 8 cases were type D. All the patients underwent posterior spinal canal decompression with pedicle screw fixation and reconstruction of anterior and middle vertebral column. The recovery of nerve function was evaluated by ASIA grading. The correction of kyphosis(Cobb angle), the volume change of injuried spinal canal, the change of anterior border height of injury vertebra which can be observed by X-rays;the internal fixation loosening and breakage and all the information of bone fusion were recorded. RESULTS: All the operations were successful, the mean operative time and intraoperative blood loss were(2.8+/-0.3) h (2.1 to 3.5 h) and (880+/-120) ml(550 to 1 350 ml), respectively. All the incisions got primary healing. All the patients were followed up for 12 to 28 months with an average of 18.4 months. All the patients obtained satisfactory bone fusion. No pseudoarticulation formation was found, and there was no loosening, breakage of pedicle screws or displacement of titanium mesh. Neurological function was improved in different degree, except in one patient with grade A and another one with grade B. According to the ASIA grade, there were 1 case of type A, 1 case of type B, 7 cases of type C, 10 cases of type D and 17 cases of type E, postoperatively. At 3 days after operative, the anterior border height of injury vertebra, Cobb angle and the volume changes of injury spinal canal were obviously improved(P{\textless}0.05), and there was no significant difference between postoperative at 3 days and final follow-up(P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal canal decompression with screw fixation and reconstruction of anterior and middle vertebral column through posterior midline approach is a safe and effective method in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with nerve injury, it is worthy to be popularized. It can complete the spinal canal decompression of 360 degree, reduction of fractures and reconstruction of vertebral three-column at the same time through a single posterior approach. The advantages includes less trauma, perfect decompression, good stability and etc.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although open procedures are the gold standard, the alternative approach of minimal invasive reduction using percutaneous screws for thoracic and lumbar spine fractures is under discussion. Aim of this study was to investigate the results of reduction and the accuracy of screw placement in minimally invasive percutaneous posterior instrumentation for these fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients with thoraco-lumbar and lumbar burst fractures and minimal invasive dorsal instrumentation were analyzed retrospectively in terms of the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and results of fracture reduction. RESULTS: In total, 542 screws were placed. Thirty-four (6.3{\%}) screws of 22 patients (17.3{\%}) were misplaced, but misplacement was minimal, replacement of any screw position due to instability was not necessary, and no new neurological deficit occurred. In thoraco-lumbar fractures (82/64.5{\%}), reduction succeeded from 2.5 +/- 6 degrees kyphosis to 5.6 +/- 5.7 degrees lordosis (p {\textless} 0.001) and in lumbar spine fractures from 6.9 degrees +/- 10.3 degrees lordosis to 14.5 degrees +/- 8.8 degrees lordosis (p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {Background No consensus exists for the management of unstable thoracolumbar (TL)  burst fractures. Surgical options include anterior, lateral, or posterior stabilization (or a combination), depending on the fracture. The potential benefits of anterior reconstruction come with increased operative time and associated morbidity. A posterior-only approach can offer stable correction without increased operative risks but may result in loss of kyphotic correction over time. Purpose To determine whether posterior-only stabilization is a viable treatment option for patients with traumatic TL fractures as opposed to anterior and combined approaches. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients with TL burst fractures who underwent posterior--only surgical intervention from 2005 to 2015. Operations were performed at two levels above and below the fractured segment using pedicle screw-rod fixation constructs with autograft and allograft. All patients received TL bracing for at least three months. Patients lost to follow-up were excluded. Results Sixty-four consecutive patients with posterior--only stabilization were identified, with 18 lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 46 patients, 93{\%} (n=43) were male and 7{\%} (n=3) were female, with a mean age of 36.8 years. All patients were followed for 12 months. The mean time until the removal of the brace was 3.54 months. No patients required additional surgical intervention for spinal stabilization. Three patients experienced postoperative complications, all of which were related to infection. Conclusions Our data indicate that posterior--only stabilization for traumatic TL burst fractures is a durable and effective option in select patients. The approach offers surgical intervention with a decreased perioperative risk as well as reduced morbidity and mortality, with a minimal increase in the risk of kyphotic deformity. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these findings clinically.},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation causes neurotoxic injury and underlies the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes are the predominant immunoregulatory cells in AD. Oleanolic acid (OA) is a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent that can ameliorate cerebral damage in ischemic environments, but its role in AD remains poorly elucidated. Here, preconditioning with OA inhibited the transcription and secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-activated astrocytes. Moreover, OA ameliorated primary neuron death triggered by incubation in conditioned medium from Abeta-treated astrocytes. Furthermore, OA also suppressed Abeta-induced expression and production of group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) in astrocytes. Supernatants supplemented with exogenous sPLA2-IIA reversed the protective role of OA against astrocyte activation-mediated neurotoxicity by suppressing cell viability and increasing LDH release, apoptosis, the contents of neurotoxic mediator arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin D2. Simultaneously, treatment with sPLA2 inhibitor aristolochic acid also counteracted neurotoxicity induced by Abeta-activated astrocytes through increasing cell viability, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and reducing the releases of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin D2. Additionally, OA restrained Ca(2+) influx in neurons after incubation with supernatants from Abeta-activated astrocytes, which was abrogated by adding sPLA2-IIA. Activating Ca(2+) signaling with BayK, an L-type Ca2+channel agonist, reversed the beneficial role of OA against neurotoxicity induced by astrocyte activation-mediated inflammatory response. OA also ameliorated cognitive deficits in an adolescent rat model of Abeta-evoked AD. These findings confirm that OA abrogates neuroinflammation and subsequent neurotoxicity induced by conditioned media from Abeta-activated astrocytes in sPLA2-IIA mediated-calcium signals. Therefore, OA may protect neurons from injury caused by neighboring astrocyte activation in AD, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy against AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Acute spine trauma (AST) has a relatively low incidence, but it often results in substantial individual impairments and societal economic burden resulting from the associated disability. Given the key role of neurosurgeons in the decision-making regarding operative management of individuals with AST, the authors performed a systematic search with scoping synthesis of relevant literature to review current knowledge regarding the economic burden of AST. METHODS This systematic review with scoping synthesis included original articles reporting cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, cost-minimization, cost-comparison, and economic analyses related to surgical management of AST, whereby AST is defined as trauma to the spine that may result in spinal cord injury with motor, sensory, and/or autonomic impairment. The initial literature search was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CCTR, and PubMed. All original articles captured in the literature search and published from 1946 to September 27, 2017, were included. Search terms used were the following: (cost analysis, cost effectiveness, cost benefit, economic evaluation or economic impact) AND (spine or spinal cord) AND (surgery or surgical). RESULTS The literature search captured 5770 titles, of which 11 original studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These 11 studies included 4 cost-utility analyses, 5 cost analyses that compared the cost of intervention with a comparator, and 2 studies examining direct costs without a comparator. There are a few potentially cost-saving strategies in the neurosurgical management of individuals with AST, including 1) early surgical spinal cord decompression for acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (or traumatic thoracolumbar fractures, traumatic cervical fractures); 2) surgical treatment of the elderly with type-II odontoid fractures, which is more costly but more effective than the nonoperative approach among individuals with age at AST between 65 and 84 years; 3) surgical treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures, which is implicated in greater direct costs but lower general-practitioner visit costs, private expenditures, and absenteeism costs than nonsurgical management; and 4) removal of pedicle screws 1-2 years after posterior instrumented fusion for individuals with thoracolumbar burst fractures, which is more cost-effective than retaining the pedicle screws. CONCLUSIONS This scoping synthesis underscores a number of potentially cost-saving opportunities for neurosurgeons when managing patients with AST. There are significant knowledge gaps regarding the potential economic impact of therapeutic choices for AST that are commonly used by neurosurgeons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Currently, no spinal classification system has achieved universal acceptance. Therefore, it is important to choose a reliable classification within clinical practice. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the intraobserver and interobserver agreement of the Load Sharing Classification (LSC), the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (TLICS), and the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. METHODS: In this web-based intraobserver and interobserver study (www.spine.hostei.com), plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures (T12-L2) were evaluated. By use of a questionnaire, fractures were classified according to the LSC, the TLICS, and the AOSpine classification. Data were analyzed with SPSS (Version 21, 76 Chicago, Illinois, USA). Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was determined by the Cohen kappa. Statistical significance was defined as P {\textless} 0.05. RESULTS: Data from 91 patients were classified twice by 7 board-certified spine surgeons. The intraobserver and interobserver reliability considering the LSC total score was noted as fair (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: kappa = 0.26/0.22). Considering the resulting TLICS total score, a moderate intraobserver agreement (kappa = 0.41) was noted, whereas the interobserver results presented only fair reliability (kappa = 0.23). In contrast to the LSC and the TLICS, the AOSpine classification showed substantial agreement considering the fracture type (A;B;C) (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: kappa = 0.71/0.61) and moderate agreement considering the fracture subtype (e.g., A0;A1;...;B1;...) (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: kappa = 0.57/0.48). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the reliability of the AOSpine fracture classification is superior to the TLICS and the LSC. Therefore, this classification system could best be applied within clinical practice.},

abstract = {The indications for operative intervention after thoracolumbar spine trauma have  been well described. Advances in minimally invasive techniques, including percutaneous pedicle screw fixation and mini-open anterolateral retractor-based approaches can improve surgical outcomes when appropriately applied by reducing blood loss, operative duration and post-operative pain. Moreover, they allow for theoretical advantages by preservation of muscular and skeletal blood supply and innervation that is typically lost during the muscular dissection of open approaches. For thoracolumbar spine fractures, percutaneous fixation allows for internal bracing of unstable fractures during healing while maintaining sagittal alignment. In instances of neurological compromise from fracture retropulsion, corpectomies may be required, and mini-open lateral approaches adopted from degenerative disease applications allow for a minimally invasive manner to treat the defect. These further allow for placement of wide rectangular-footprint expandable vertebral body replacement devices to provide anterior column support. We believe this allows for lower rates of subsidence and helps to maintain the biomechanical integrity necessary to prevent post-traumatic malalignment and kyphosis. Together, these minimally invasive techniques combined supply the spine surgeon with a minimally invasive armamentarium to treat nearly all thoracolumbar spine trauma. Surgeons should be comfortable with the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches in order to successfully apply them for this pathology.},

abstract = {Excessive accumulation of neutrophils and their uncontrolled death by necrosis at the site of inflammation exacerbates inflammatory responses and leads to self-amplifying tissue injury and loss of organ function, as exemplified in a variety of respiratory diseases. In homeostasis, neutrophils are inactivated by apoptosis, and non phlogistically removed by neighboring macrophages in a process known as efferocytosis, which promotes the resolution of inflammation. The present study assessed the potential anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution benefits of tylvalosin, a recently developed broad-spectrum veterinary macrolide derived from tylosin. Recent findings indicate that tylvalosin may modulate inflammation by suppressing NF-kappaB activation. Neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from fresh blood samples obtained from 12- to 22-week-old pigs. Leukocytes exposed to vehicle or to tylvalosin (0.1, 1.0, or 10 microg/mL; 0.096-9.6 microM) were assessed at various time points for apoptosis, necrosis, efferocytosis, and changes in the production of cytokines and lipid mediators. The findings indicate that tylvalosin increases porcine neutrophil and macrophage apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, without altering levels of necrosis or reactive oxygen species production. Importantly, tylvalosin increased the release of pro-resolving Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and Resolvin D1 (RvD 1 ) while inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in Ca(2+) ionophore-stimulated porcine neutrophils. Tylvalosin increased neutrophil phospholipase C activity, an enzyme involved in releasing arachidonic acid from membrane stores. Tylvalosin also inhibited pro-inflammatory chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL-8, also known as Interleukin-8) and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha) protein secretion in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Together, these data illustrate that tylvalosin has potent immunomodulatory effects in porcine leukocytes in addition to its antimicrobial properties.},

abstract = {Introduction: Polymethacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used in vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty, but its use has been associated with complications. This study tests three hypotheses: (1) whether strontium hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) is equivalent to PMMA for restoring thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures, (2) whether the incidence of PMMA leakage is similar to that of Sr-HA leakage, and (3) whether Sr-HAis is resorbed and substituted by new vertebral bone. Materials and Methods: Two age- and sex-matched groups received short percutaneous pedicle screw fixation plus PEEK implant (Kiva, VCF Treatment System, Benvenue Medical, Santa Clara, CA, USA) filled with either Sr-HA (Group A) or PMMA (Group B) after A2- and A3/AO-type thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and imaging parameters, which included segmental kyphosis angle (SKA), vertebral body height ratios (VBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), bone cement leakage, and Sr-HA resorption, were compared between the two groups. Results: The average follow-up was 28 months. No differences in VAS scores between Groups A and B were observed at baseline. Baseline back pain in both groups improved significantly three months postoperatively. Anterior, middle, and posterior VBHr did not differ between the two groups at any time point. SKA was improved insignificantly in both groups. SCE decreased insignificantly in both groups on 12-month follow-up using computed tomography (CT). PMMA leakage was observed in one patient, while no Sr-HA paste leakages occurred. Sr-HA resorption and replacement with vertebral bone were observed, and no new fractures were observed. Conclusions: As all hypotheses were confirmed, the authors recommend the use of Sr-HA instead of PMMA in traumatic spine fractures, although more patients and longer follow-up will be needed to strengthen these results. This trial is registered with NCT03431519.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the surgical results of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) after spinal canal decompression via a small laminectomy for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHOD: Twenty-seven patients underwent PPSF after spinal canal decompression via small laminectomies between April 2009 and April 2015. Inclusion criteria consisted of a single-level, closed, thoracolumbar burst fracture and neurological symptoms. Decompression was performed via a small laminectomy, followed by PPSF, including at the level of the fractured vertebra. Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body index were each measured from lateral radiographs before and after surgery, and at last follow-up. Neurological assessment was made using the Frankel grading system. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 26months. The preoperative average Cobb angle was 15.8 degrees +/-6.6 degrees , and significantly decreased to 6.5 degrees +/-6.2 degrees postoperatively (p{\textless}0.001). Average Cobb angle at last follow-up increased slightly to 8.9 degrees +/-6.9 degrees , but this was not significant (p=0.112). The preoperative average vertebral wedge angle was 20.6 degrees +/-6.3 degrees , and decreased significantly to 12.2 degrees +/-6.2 degrees postoperatively (p{\textless}0.001). The vertebral body index significantly decreased from 0.58+/-0.11 to a postoperative value of 0.78+/-0.10 (p{\textless}0.001). Clinically, no patient deteriorated subsequent to surgery. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation after spinal canal decompression via small laminectomy provides significant kyphotic correction and improved neurological outcome while offering decreased surgical morbidity. This may be applied as an effective primary surgery in select patients with TLBFs with neurologic symptoms.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate if bone substitutes are strictly necessary to restore the vertebral body height and improve the clinical outcome, in patients with thoracolumbar or lumbar AO type A post-traumatic vertebral fractures, managed with balloon kyphoplasty combined with posterior screw and rod system. METHODS: 105 patients with post-traumatic thoracolumbar spine fracture were recruited. At baseline, the patients underwent a CT and an MRI of the spine. Clinical evaluation was performed, using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), at baseline, 48 h after surgery, at 3-month follow-up (FU), 6-month FU, 48 h after the instrumentation removal and at 24-month FU. At each FU, VK, regional kyphosis (RK), central wall (MH/PH) and anterior wall (AH/PH) heights were assessed on lateral spine X-rays. At 6-month FU, a CT scan of the spine was performed to investigate the fracture healing. The posterior instrumentation was removed 7 months after surgery (range 6-10 months). RESULTS: A significant reduction of mean VAS (p {\textless} 0.05) and ODI (p {\textless} 0.05) was observed after surgery; no impairment of these scores was observed after the instrumentation removal. A significant correction of VK, RK, AH/PH and MH/PH was recorded after surgery; no significant changes of these values were noticed at subsequent FU. After the instrumentation removal, only an RK impairment was recorded, but it was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: PMMA or bone substitutes are not necessary to keep the reduction of the endplate obtained with the balloon tamp, when BK is performed in the association with posterior percutaneous pedicle screws instrumentation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of thoracolumbar posttraumatic compression fractures varies widely among centers, and there is no real consensus as to the optimum approach. The objective of our retrospective study was to detect the progression of vertebral kyphosis in nonosteoporotic patients treated by balloon kyphoplasty (KPB) who presented with recent compression fractures of the thoracolumbar region. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated the evolution of vertebral and regional kyphosis in 77 patients treated by KPB for compression vertebral fractures (Magerl A) between 2007 and 2011. All treated patients, even those lost to follow-up, were included in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the 77 patients, a 2.4 degrees deterioration of vertebral kyphosis (P = 0.0004) and a 4.5 degrees worsening of regional kyphosis (P {\textless} 0.0001) were observed at the end of the follow-up period. No statistical correlation between the worsened kyphosis and the deterioration of long-term pain was identified. The mean visual analog scale score was 2.5, associated with very low disability on functional scores. A3-2 and A3-3 fractures are characterized by worsening vertebral and regional kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of studies of posttraumatic vertebral compression fractures in the scientific literature explains the lack of consensus regarding the optimum treatment approach. Postoperative results with KPB favor vertebral and regional kyphosis stability. KPB remains indicated in this situation except in cases of for burst fracture.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the hidden blood loss (HBL) in treatment of AO type A1-A3 thoracolumbar fractures with three different approaches and to explore the influential factors of HBL among patients after the surgery of internal fixation for thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 85 patients in treatment of thoracolumbar fractures: 25 patients via percutaneous approach (Group A), 33 patients via paraspinal approach (Group B), and 27 patients via conventional open approach (Group C). The demographic information of the patients was collected. Each patient's preoperative and postoperative hematocrit were recorded and used for calculating the blood loss according to the Gross's formula. The difference of blood loss between the three groups was measured by ANOVA. And influential factors were further analyzed by multivariate linear regression analysis in each group. RESULTS: The average HBL was 240.0 +/- 65.1 mL in Group A, 313.7 +/- 138.1 mL in Group B, and 382 +/- 153.8 mL in Group C. There was statistical difference in the HBL between three groups (P = 0.000). However, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that HBL of three approaches was not associated with age, gender, body mass index (BMI), percentage of height loss, percentage of height restoration, fracture type, or operation time. CONCLUSION: There was a substantial HBL in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, which was neglected by surgeons. Further investigation is necessary to study the risk factors for surgery on HBL in treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Traumatic thoraco-lumbar spine fracture spine with a concomitant blunt aortic injury is uncommon but potentially a fatal association. Our aim was to clarify: morphology of spinal fractures related to vascular damages and vice versa, diagnostic procedures and decision-making process for the best treatment options for spine and vessels. METHODS: We enrolled 42 cases culled from the literature and five personal ones, reviewing in detail by AO Spine Classification, Society of Vascular Surgery classification and Abbreviated Injury Scale for neurological evaluation. RESULTS: Most fractures were at T11-L2 (29 cases; 62{\%}) and type C (17; 70{\%}). 17 (38{\%}) were neurological. Most common vascular damage was the rupture (20; 43{\%}), followed by intimal tear (13; 28{\%}) and pseudoaneurysm (9; 19{\%}). Vascular injury often required open or endovascular repair before spinal fixation. Distraction developed aortic intimal damage until rupture, while flexion-distraction lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm and rotation-torsion full laceration of collateral branches. CT and angio-CT were investigations of choice, followed by angiography. Neurological condition remained unchanged in 28 cases (90{\%}). Overall mortality was 30{\%}, but it was higher in AIS A. CONCLUSION: Relationship between thoraco-lumbar fracture and vascular lesion is rare, but potentially fatal. Comprehension of spinal biomechanics and vascular damages could be crucial to avoid poor results or decrease mortality. Frequently, traction of the aorta and its vessels is realized by C-dislocated fractures. CT and angio-CT are recommended. Spine stabilization should always follow the vascular repair. Early severe deficits worse the prognosis related to neurological recovery and survival. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting pedicle enhancement and predicting future collapse in patients with acute benign osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional morphological classification regarding compression versus burst fractures cannot accurately anticipate the prognosis of further collapse. Identifying subgroups with a higher risk for further collapse may be beneficial in determining the treatment modality, which should be decided immediately after the injury. METHODS: One hundred fourteen patients with benign OVCFs who, at the onset, underwent contrast-enhanced spine MRI between 2003 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were recruited on the basis of predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the compression progression rate; other potential variables included demographic and clinical characteristics, initial compression rates, and kyphotic angles. In addition, other structural abnormalities on MRI were assessed. The compression progression rates were compared according to pedicle enhancement, and the prognostic significance of pedicle enhancement for further collapse were analyzed. RESULTS: Further compression progression rates were significantly higher in the pedicle-enhanced (PE) group than in the nonenhanced (NE) group. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that pedicle enhancement may be associated with further compression progression {\textgreater}/=10{\%}. The vertebral augmentation (VAG) protective effect against collapse was only significant within the PE group, while bone densitometry and patients' mobility were significant only within the NE group. The log-rank test revealed a statistically significant difference in the rates of further collapse {\textgreater}/=10{\%} during the 1 year between the groups. CONCLUSION: Sign of pedicle enhancement is a potential risk factor for further compression progression. Contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed at the onset to better determine the future risk of collapse and to choose a better treatment modality for benign OVCF patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In combined posterior-anterior stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures, the expandable vertebral body replacement device (VBRD) is typically placed bisegmentally for anterior column reconstruction (ACR). The aim of this study, however, was to assess feasibility, outcome and potential pitfalls of monosegmental ACR using a VBRD. In addition, clinical and radiological outcome of monosegmental ACR was related to that of bisegmental ACR using the same thoracoscopic technique. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive neurologically intact patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) treated by combined posterior-anterior stabilization were included. Monosegmental ACR was performed in 18 and bisegmental ACR in 19 patients. Fracture type and extent of vertebral body comminution were determined on preoperative CT scans. Monosegmental and bisegmental kyphosis angles were analyzed preoperatively, postoperatively and at final radiological follow-up. Clinical outcome was assessed after a minimum of 2 years (74 +/- 45 months; range 24-154; follow-up rate 89.2{\%}) using VAS Spine Score, RMDQ, ODI and WHOQOL-BREF. RESULTS: Monosegmental ACR resulted in a mean monosegmental and bisegmental surgical correction of - 15.6 +/- 7.7 degrees and - 14.7 +/- 8.1 degrees , respectively. Postoperative monosegmental and bisegmental loss of correction averaged 2.7 +/- 2.7 degrees and 5.2 +/- 3.7 degrees , respectively. Two surgical pitfalls of monosegmental ACR were identified: VBRD positioning (1) onto the weak cancellous bone (too far cranially to the inferior endplate of the fractured vertebra) and (2) onto a significantly compromised inferior endplate with at least two (even subtle) fracture lines. Ignoring these pitfalls resulted in VBRD subsidence in five cases. When relating the clinical and radiological outcome of monosegmental ACR to that of bisegmental ACR, no significant differences were found, except for frequency of VBRD subsidence (5 vs. 0, P = 0.02) and bisegmental loss of correction (5.2 +/- 3.7 degrees vs. 2.6 +/- 2.5 degrees , P = 0.022). After exclusion of cases with VBRD subsidence, the latter did not reach significance anymore (4.9 +/- 4.0 degrees vs. 2.6 +/- 2.5 degrees , P = 0.084). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that monosegmental ACR using a VBRD is feasible in thoracolumbar burst fractures if the inferior endplate is intact (incomplete burst fractures) or features only a single simple split fracture line (burst-split fractures). If the two identified pitfalls are avoided, monosegmental ACR may be a viable alternative to bisegmental ACR in selected thoracolumbar burst fractures to spare a motion segment and to reduce the distance for bony fusion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determining the association between mechanism of trauma, and the type of spine column fracture is a useful approach for exactly describing spine injury on forensic medicine field. We aimed to determine mechanism of trauma based on distribution of the transition of spinal column fractures. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was performed on 117 consecutive patients with the history of spinal trauma who were admitted to emergency ward of Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran from April 2015 to March 2016. The baseline characteristics were collected by reviewing the hospital recorded files. RESULTS: With respect to mechanism of fracture, 63.2{\%} of fractures were caused by falling, 30.8{\%} by collisions with motor vehicles, and others caused by the violence. Regarding site of fracture, lumbosacral was affected in 47.9{\%}, thoracic in 29.9{\%}, and cervical in 13.7{\%}. Regarding type of fracture, burst fracture was the most common type (71.8{\%}) followed by compressive fracture (14.5{\%}). The site of fracture was specifically associated with the mechanism of injury; the most common injuries induced by falling from height were found in lumbosacral and cervical sites, and the most frequent injuries by traffic accidents were found in thoracic site; also the injuries following violence were observed more in lumbar vertebrae. The burst fractures were more revealed in the patients affected by falling from height and by traffic accidents, and both burst and compressive fractures were more observed with the same result in the patients injured with violence (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The type of spine fracture due to trauma is closely associated with the mechanism of trauma that can be helpful in legal medicine to identify the mechanism of trauma in affected patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In recent years, delivery of cost-effective "essential neurosurgery" in resource-limited communities has been recognized as an indispensable part of health care and a global health priority. The aim of this study was to review outcomes from operative management of spine trauma at a resource-limited government hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and to provide an epidemiologic report to guide prevention programs. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospective neurosurgical database was performed to identify risk factors for spine trauma and severe spinal cord injury (American Spinal Injury Association A or American Spinal Injury Association B) and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery for patients treated at Preah Kossamak Hospital for subaxial and thoracolumbar spine trauma from 2013 to 2016. RESULTS: Surgical treatment was provided to 277 patients with cervical or thoracolumbar spine trauma, including 36 facet dislocations and 135 thoracolumbar burst fractures at a cost of {\$}100-{\$}280 per surgery. Six patients (2.2{\%}) required treatment for postoperative wound infection. Reoperation was performed in 8 patients (2.9{\%}) for wrong-level surgery. Failure of short-segment pedicle screw fixation was discovered in 4 patients (7.0{\%}). Neurologic improvement was reported by 64 patients (65.3{\%}) with incomplete spinal cord injury and available long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable neurosurgical care can be provided in a safe and sustainable manner to patients with traumatic spine and spinal cord injuries in resource-limited communities. This supports the call for essential neurosurgery to be made available around the world to individuals from all socioeconomic strata.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation is used to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, no randomized controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the two approaches--the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine without neurological deficit were randomized to receive either the Wiltse's paraspinal approach (group A, 24 patients) or open book laminectomy (group B, 23 patients). Patients were followed postoperatively for average of 27.4 months. Clinical and radiographic data of the two approaches were collected and compared. RESULTS: Our results showed the anterior segmental height, kyphotic angle, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and Smiley-Webster Scale (SWS) score significantly improved postoperatively in both groups, indicating that both the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy can effectively treat thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures. The Wiltse's paraspinal approach was found to have significantly shorter operating time, less blood loss, and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open book laminectomy. However, there were two (2/24) patients in group A that had neurological deficits postoperatively and required a second exploratory operation. Dural tears and/or cauda equina entrapment were subsequently found in four patients in group B and all two patients of neurological deficits in group A during operation. No screw loosening, plate breakage, or other internal fixation failures were found at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that either of the two surgical approaches can achieve satisfactory results in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with greenstick lamina fractures. However, if there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion of a dural tear and/or cauda equina entrapment pre-operation, patients should receive an open book laminectomy to avoid a second exploratory operation. More research is still needed to optimize clinical decision-making regarding surgical approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fractures of the distal radius are the most common fractures in the upper extremity, and their incidence is increasing with the aging of the population. Despite anatomical reduction of the bones, many patients complain of residual pain. A reason for this may be ligament injury not addressed during surgery or conservative treatment. Radiographic measurements may allow assessment of ligament integrity but they may be population specific and differ among races. OBJECTIVES: To assess radiographic wrist measurements in an Israeli population and to compare them to existing values. METHODS: Demographic data, previous diagnosis of osteoporosis, fracture classification, and radiologic measurements (radial height, radial inclination, ulnar variance, volar tilt, and d2/w2) were measured and compared. RESULTS: The study was comprised of 53 females and 27 males, mean age 64 years, with wrist radiographs following surgery. Of these, 13{\%} were smokers and 38.5{\%} had osteoporosis. According to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen classification system, most of the fractures were comminuted and intra-articular. The mean values for all measurements did not differ significantly from values in the literature. The average d2/w2 ratio (describing the radiocarpal ligaments) was 0.42, significantly differing from this measurement in normal wrists as described in the literature, but similar to a population following surgery (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our population had more fragility fractures than other populations. Otherwise, our demographics and measurements did not differ from normal values described in the literature. This study supports the validity of any wrist radiographic study performed in our population.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation is a common method to increase pullout strength fixed for osteoporotic spines. However, few papers evaluated whether these pedicle screws migrated with time and functional outcome in these geriatrics following PMMA-augmented pedicle screw fixation. METHODS: From March 2006 to September 2008, consecutive 64 patients were retrospectively enrolled. VAS and ODI were used to evaluate functional outcomes. Kyphotic angle at instrumented levels and horizontal and vertical distances (HD and VD) between screw tip and anterior and upper cortexes were evaluated. To avoid bias, we used horizontal and vertical migration index (HMI and VMI) to re-evaluate screw positions with normalization by the mean of superior and inferior endplates or anterior and posterior vertebral body height, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-six patients with 282 PMMA-augmented screws were analyzed with mean follow-up of 95 months. Nine patients were further excluded due to bed-ridden at latest follow-up. Twenty-six females and 11 males with mean T score of - 2.7 (range, - 2.6 to - 4.1) and mean age for operation of 77.6 +/- 4.3 years (range, 65 to 86). The serial HD and kyphotic angle statistically progressed with time. The serial VD did not statistically change with time (p = 0.23), and neither HMI nor VMI (p = 0.772 and 0.631). Pre-operative DEXA results did not correlate with kyphotic angle. Most patients (80.4{\%}) maintained similar functional outcomes at latest follow-up. The incidence of screws loosening was 2.7{\%} of patients and 1.4{\%} of screws, respectively. The overall incidences of systemic post-operative co-morbidities were 24.3{\%} with overall 20.2 days for hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Most patients (80{\%}) remained similar functional outcomes at latest follow-up in spite of kyphosis progression. The incidence of implant failure was not high, but the post-operative systemic co-morbidities were higher, which has to be informed before index surgery.},

Although acute changes in the systemic immune compartment have been linked to outcome severity, the long-term consequences of TBI on systemic immune function are unknown. Here, adult male C57Bl/6 mice underwent moderate-level controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham surgery, and systemic immune function was evaluated at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 60 days post-injury. Bone marrow, blood, thymus, and spleen were examined by flow cytometry to assess changes in immune composition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, phagocytic activity, and cytokine production. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from sham and 60-day CCI mice were cultured for immune challenge studies using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) models. Acutely, TBI caused robust bone marrow activation and neutrophilia. Neutrophils and monocytes exhibited impairments in respiratory burst, cytokine production, and phagocytosis; in contrast, ROS levels and pro-inflammatory cytokine production were chronically elevated at 60 days post-injury. Cultures of BMDMs from chronic CCI mice demonstrated defects in LPS- and IL-4-induced polarization when compared with stimulated BMDMs from sham mice. TBI also caused thymic involution, inverted CD4:CD8 ratios, chronic T lymphopenia, greater memory conversion, increased T cell activation, impaired interferon gamma induction, and chronically elevated Th1 cytokine and ROS production. Collectively, our in-depth phenotypic and functional analyses demonstrate that TBI induces widespread suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses after TBI. Moreover, at chronic time points, TBI mice exhibit hallmarks of accelerated immune aging, displaying chronic deficits in systemic immune function.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient characteristics and associated injuries in those sustaining a spine fracture from personal watercraft (PWC) usage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are few studies regarding PWC use and injuries, and even more scarce are studies evaluating PWC usage and spine injuries. Identifying high-risk actions and individuals can help to effectively treat them, reduce mortality, and possibly avoid certain spine fractures. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 142 patients admitted from the emergency department with PWC-related injuries at a single-level I trauma center from January 1, 2004 to May 1, 2017. Twenty-six (18.3{\%}) sustained a spine fracture, totaling 71 fractures. Statistical analysis was used to investigate the patient characteristics, specific mechanisms of injury, injury severity score (ISS), and associated injuries. Patients expiring (12) had incomplete evaluations and were excluded from most reported results. RESULTS: Spine fractures were not associated with age, race, or sex, but were associated with a higher ISS, intensive care unit length, in-patient length of stay, cerebral injury, and abdominal/genitourinary (GU) injury. There were 8 cervical fractures, 22 thoracic fractures, 33 lumbar, and 8 sacral fractures. Axial load injuries were associated with vertebral body fractures and specifically burst fractures. Being a driver or passenger did not influence likelihood of a spine fracture, but did correlate with abdominal/GU injury. Five (19.2{\%}) of patients with spine fractures required eight spine surgeries during admission. Mortality was associated with females, severe systemic injuries (ISS {\textgreater}/= 15), direct collision mechanism of injury, and the spring season. CONCLUSION: PWC usage may result in spine fractures with a moderate percentage requiring orthopedic surgery. Additional studies should examine how hull or seat modifications can lessen the risk of axial loads leading to spine fractures. PWC patients with spine fractures should also be evaluated for abdominal/GU and cerebral injuries at presentation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effects and multifidus muscle injury of different approaches, including unilateral Wiltse intermuscular approach and intramuscular approach combined with contralateral decompression, in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture. METHODS: Forty-three patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture were enrolled in the study from January 2010 to December 2014, including 29 males and 14 females with an average age of 42.3 years old(ranged from 21 to 64 years old). The patients were treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation and unilateral decompression and were divided into Wiltse intermuscular approach group (group A) and intramuscular approach group (group B) according to surgical approach. Operation time and intraoperative bleeding were recorded for all patients; visual analogue scale(VAS) was compared 1 d preoperatively, 1 week, 12 months postoperatively between two groups; preoperation and 12 months postoperatively, the fractured vertebral canal and two-sides multifidus muscle of the same section were observed and compared by CT measure between two groups. RESULTS: All the patients were follow-up for 14 to 21 months with an average of 16.3 months. Partial wound non-healing occurred in 3 patients and the wound ultimately healing after debridgement suture and change dressings. No screw breakage was found. There was significant difference in operation and intraoperative bleeding operation between two groups (P{\textless}0.05), while there was no significant difference in VAS score of 1 d preoperatively, 1 week, 12 months postoperatively between two groups(P{\textgreater}0.05). As for CT measurement results, postoperative vertebral canal narrow ratio was significant decreased in all patients(P{\textless}0.05), while perioperative changes of the two-sides multifidus muscle cross section area and density were significant in group A (P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference in group B (P{\textgreater}0.05). Neurologic status of all patients got recovery at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The method of unilateral Wiltse intermuscular approach combined with contralateral decompression for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture has good clinical effects, also it is less invasive and less damage to multifidus muscle compared with intramuscular approach.},

Methods A narrative literature review was performed to propose a treatment algorithm to guide the management of thoracolumbar spinal trauma (TLST). In order to classify injuries and surgical indications, we utilized the two most recent classification systems (TLICS and new AO spine classification) and related recent literature. Results Injuries were categorized into three groups according to stability: 1) Stable injuries, 2) Potentially unstable injuries/ delayed instability or 3) Clearly unstable injuries. Stable injuries included most of AO type A fractures without neurological deficit, mild clinical symptoms and without risk factors for late deformity. Potentially unstable injuries generally included patients without neurological deficits but with some risk factors for late deformity or with severe clinical symptoms. Surgery may be recommended in this group. Finally, clearly unstable injuries are those with spinal dislocations and/ or with neurological deficits, especially in the setting of persistent neural tissue compression, requiring early surgical treatment. Conclusions The proposed treatment algorithm is intended to help surgeons select the best treatment modality for their patients, categorizing injuries according to their main characteristics into one of these three groups. Further studies addressing the reliability and safety of this algorithm are necessary.},

The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1{\%}) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2{\%}). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2{\%} of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2{\%}, and lead gloves by 7{\%}. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7{\%}. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia (P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize intraoperative radiation exposure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are likely to undergo osteoporosis as consequence of  hormone manipulation and/or chemotherapy. Little is known about possible increased risk of fracture in this population. The aim of this study was to describe the biomechanical effect of a metastatic lesion in an osteoporotic lumbar spine model. METHODS: A finite element model of two spinal motion segments (L3-L5) was extracted from a previously developed L3-Sacrum model and used to analyze the effect of metastasis size and bone mineral density (BMD) on Vertebral bulge (VB) and Vertebral height (VH). VB and VH represent respectively radial and axial displacement and they have been correlated to burst fracture. A total of 6 scenarios were evaluated combining three metastasis sizes (no metastasis, 15{\%} and 30{\%} of the vertebral body) and two BMD conditions (normal BMD and osteoporosis). RESULTS: 15{\%} metastasis increased VB and VH by 178{\%} and 248{\%}, respectively in normal BMD model; while VB and VH increased by 134{\%} and 174{\%} in osteoporotic model. 30{\%} metastasis increased VB and VH by 88{\%} and 109{\%}, respectively, when compared to 15{\%} metastasis in normal BMD model; while VB and VH increased by 59{\%} and 74{\%} in osteoporotic model. CONCLUSION: A metastasis in the osteoporotic lumbar spine always leads to a higher risk of vertebral fracture. This risk increases with the size of the metastasis. Unexpectedly, an increment in metastasis size in the normal BMD spine produces a greater impact on vertebral stability compared to the osteoporotic spine.},

abstract = {Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) is a well-known minimally invasive surgery (MIS) employed in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures (TBF). However, hardware failure and loss of angular correction are common limitations caused by the poor support of the anterior column of the spine. Balloon kyphoplasty (KP) is another MIS that was successfully used in the treatment of compression fractures by augmenting the injured vertebral body with cement. To overcome the limitations of stand-alone PPSF, it was suggested to augment PPSF with KP as a surgical treatment of TBF. Yet, little is known about the biomechanical alteration occurred to the spine after performing such procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the immediate post-operative biomechanical performance of stand-alone PPSF, stand-alone-KP, and KP-augmented PPSF procedures. Novel three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of the thoracolumbar junction that describes the fractured spine and the three investigated procedures were developed and tested under mechanical loading conditions. The spinal stiffness, stresses at the implanted hardware, and the intradiscal pressure at the upper and lower segments were measured and compared. The results showed no major differences in the measured parameters between stand-alone PPSF and KP-augmented PPSF procedures, and demonstrated that the stand-alone KP may restore the stiffness of the intact spine. Accordingly, there was no immediate post-operative biomechanical advantage in augmenting PPSF with KP when compared to stand-alone PPSF, and fatigue testing may be required to evaluate the long-term biomechanical performance of such procedures.},

abstract = {Introduction: Management of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial in the  literature. The primary aims of this study were to assess different levels of fixation with respect to radiological outcomes in terms of fracture reduction and future loss of correction. Methods: This is a single center, retrospective study. Fifty-five patients presenting with thoracolumbar fractures between January 2012 and December 2015 were analyzed in the study. The levels of fixation were divided in 3 groups, 1 vertebra above and 1 below the fracture (1/1), 2 above and 2 below (2/2), and 2 above and 1 below (2/1). Results: The most common mechanism was high fall injury and the most common vertebra L1. Burst fractures were the ones with the highest incidence. The 2/2 fixation achieved the best reduction of the fracture but with no statistical significance. The correction is maintained better by the 2/2 fixation but there is no statistical difference compared to the other fixations. Insertion of screws at the fracture level did not improve outcomes. Conclusion: The data of this study identified a trend towards better radiological outcomes for fracture reduction and maintenance of the correction in the 2/2 fixations. However these results are not statistically significant. Future multicenter prospective clinical trials are needed in order to agree on the ideal management and method of fixation for thoracolumbar fractures.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein L1 ( ApoL1) genetic variants are strongly associated with kidney diseases. We investigated the role of ApoL1 variants in monocyte differentiation and eicosanoid production in macrophages, as activated tissue macrophages in kidney might contribute to kidney injury. In human monocyte THP-1 cells, transient overexpression of ApoL1 (G0, G1, G2) by transfection resulted in a 5- to 11-fold increase in CD14 and CD68 gene expression, similar to that seen with phorbol-12-myristate acetate treatment. All ApoL1 variants caused monocytes to differentiate into atypical M1 macrophages with marked increase in M1 markers CD80, TNF, IL1B, and IL6 and modest increase in the M2 marker CD163 compared with control cells. ApoL1-G1 transfection induced additional CD206 and TGFB1 expression, and ApoL1-G2 transfection induced additional CD204 and TGFB1 expression. Gene expression of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthase and thromboxane synthase and both gene and protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were increased by ApoL1-G1 and -G2 variants compared with -G0 transfection. Higher levels of PGE2 and thromboxane B2, a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were released into the supernatant of cultured THP-1 cells transfected with ApoL1-G1 and -G2, but not -G0. The increase in PGE2, thromboxane B2, and TGF-beta1 was inhibited by COX-2-specific inhibitor CAY10404 but not by COX-1-specific inhibitor SC-560. These results demonstrate a novel role of ApoL1 variants in the regulation of monocyte differentiation and eicosanoid metabolism, which could modify the immune response and promote inflammatory signaling within the local targeted organs and tissues including the kidney.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess and compare the efficacy of two minimally invasive techniques  (percutaneous pedicle screw with intermediate screw vs. percutaneous pedicle screw with kyphoplasty) for spinal fracture fixation by comparing the segmental kyphosis and vertebral kyphosis angles after trauma before surgery, after surgery, and at 4-month and 12-month follow-up. METHODS: Data from 49 patients without neurological deficit treated by either percutaneous pedicle screw with intermediate screw or percutaneous pedicle screw with kyphoplasty were retrospectively analysed. The segmental kyphosis and vertebral kyphosis angles over time were calculated and correlated with the type of procedure, AO classification, lumbar or thoracic site and the age and sex of the patients. RESULTS: After surgery, both techniques were found to be efficacious means of bringing about a significant correction of the segmental kyphosis angle (p = 0.002) and a just significant correction of the vertebral kyphosis angle (p = 0.06), although less effectively in thoracic fractures (p = 0.004). At follow-up, the vertebral kyphosis angle was stable in both groups, while there was a significant loss of segmental kyphosis angle stability in the percutaneous pedicle screw with kyphoplasty group at 1 year (p = 0.004); fractured thoracic vertebrae maintained a greater vertebral kyphosis angle (p = 0.06) and segmental kyphosis angle (p {\textless} 0.001), than the lumbar. CONCLUSION: At 1 year after surgery, the use of intermediate screws in fractured vertebrae seemed to maintain a more efficacious correction with respect to kyphoplasty, although thoracic fracture sites appear to be associated with greater post-traumatic segmental kyphosis and lesser stability in the long term after both percutaneous surgical techniques.},

abstract = {Background: Motocross is a form of motorcycle racing held on established off-road circuits and has been a recreational and competitive sport across the world for {\textgreater}100 years. In the United Kingdom alone, motocross has grown into a phenomenally ambitious and popular franchise. There are {\textgreater}200 motocross clubs across the country, permitting {\textgreater}900 events annually. Purpose: To assess the current trend of spine-related motocross injuries over the past 5 years. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Data were prospectively collected over 5 years (August 2010-August 2015) at our regional trauma and spine unit, regardless of whether the rider was performing the sport competitively or recreationally. Results: During the study period, spine-related injuries were identified for 174 patients (age range, 6-75 years) who were directly referred to our department following recreational or competitive motocross, with most injuries being sustained within the early spring and summer months, representing the start of the motocross season. A significant number of injuries were in males (n = 203, 94{\%}), with the majority of injuries occurring within the 21- to 30-year-old age group. A total of 116 (54{\%}) injuries required operative treatment. The most common spinal injury was thoracolumbar burst fracture (n = 95), followed by chance fractures (n = 26). Conclusion: This data series emphasizes the prevalence and devastation of motocross-related spinal injuries in the United Kingdom and may serve in administering sanctions and guidelines to governing bodies of motocross. The spinal injuries that occur during motocross have significant capital connotations for regional spinal centers. The recent surge in motocross popularity is correlated with the number of injuries, which have increased over the past 5 years by almost 500{\%}.},

METHODS: The established L1 fracture was fixed with 10 different depths of screw insertion: 10-100{\%} screw-path length (SPL). Loading on the T12 endplate was simulated. RESULTS: Screws inserted to 60-100{\%} depths has a higher axial displacement of screw against injured vertebrae and maximum stress of screws compared to those of screws inserted to 30-50{\%} depths and 10-20{\%} (P{\textless} 0.05). No significant difference was noted among 60-100{\%} SPL groups. Under single loading condition, the incidence rate of maximum stress of each screw ranged from 16.7-50.0{\%}. Chi-square test showed superior screw has a higher incidence rate of maximum stress than inferior screw (P{\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Screws inserted to 60{\%} depth or more can achieve effective strength to withstand the postoperative height correction loss of the L1 vertebrae fracture. However, continuous prolonged depth of screw insertion did not significantly increase the effective strength of the screw against injured vertebrae and maximum equivalent stress of screws. The incidence rate of the maximum stress of each screw in correlated with position of screw insertion but not associated with the screw insertion depth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deer hunting is popular in much of the United States. In Wisconsin, use of tree stands for hunting is common. Spine surgeons at a Level 1 Trauma Center observed a high incidence of spine and spinal cord injury due to falls from tree stands while hunting. This study's purpose is to systematically characterize and classify those injuries. METHODS: We reviewed the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics' trauma database for tree stand-related injuries from 1999 to 2013. We collected and analyzed data pertaining to hunters' demographics, comorbidities, type and mechanism of injury, injury severity, and management. RESULTS: We identified 117 patients evaluated after a tree stand fall. Sixty-five (ages 16-76) suffered spine fractures that occurred at all levels, from occipital condyle to sacrum, with thoracolumbar compression and burst fractures being most common. Fractures occurred in the following locations: cranio-cervical junction (8.7{\%}), cervical spine (7.6{\%}), cervical-thoracic junction (6.5{\%}), thoracic spine (32.6{\%}), thoracolumbar junction (33.7{\%}), and lumbar spine (10.9{\%}). Twenty-one patients (32{\%}) experienced a single spinal fracture; 44 patients (68{\%}) suffered multiple spinal fractures. Twenty-five patients (38{\%}) required surgical fixation; 19 patients experienced loss of neurologic function: 5 complete spinal cord injuries (SCI), 5 incomplete SCI, 2 central cord syndromes, and 8 radiculopathies. Two mortalities, both of cardiopulmonary etiology, were noted-one in a patient without a spine fracture and the other in a patient with a complete spinal cord injury at T4. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of spine fractures are treated nonoperatively. However, enough patients require surgical intervention that consultation with a neurosurgical or orthopedic spine surgeon is prudent. It is more common to have multiple spine fractures from a tree stand fall, therefore, it is recommended that if 1 fracture is identified the entire spine be evaluated for additional fractures. For safety, it is recommended that hunters wear and use safety harnesses appropriately. Additionally, keeping the height of the tree stand at 10 feet or less is associated with a lower likelihood of spinal cord injury. Further study is needed to determine additional interventions such as education that might reduce the injury frequency in this population.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Spinopelvic fixation and triangular osteosynthesis give firm internal fixation for unstable pelvic ring injuries (UPRI), but with sacrifice of mobility of the lumbar spine. Here, we describe the procedure and outcomes of a new approach, which we refer to as "within ring"-based sacroiliac rod fixation (SIRF). METHODS: The patient was placed in a prone position and longitudinal skin incisions were made at the medial margins of the bilateral posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS). After reduction of fracture, a pedicle screw was inserted into the first sacral vertebra on the injured side and iliac screws inserted through the bilateral PSIS were bridged using rods. RESULTS: SIRF was performed in 15 patients. The AO/OTA classification was 61-B2.3 in 1, C1.3 in 4, C2.3 in 7, C3.3 in 1, and H-type spinopelvic dissociation in two cases. The mean operative time was 179 (110-298) minutes, mean blood loss was 533 (100-2700) cc. One patient died during hospitalization and three patients stopped outpatient treatment. The other 11 patients achieved bone union without major loss of reduction in a mean post-operative follow-up period of 23.8 (4-50) months. The mean Majeed score at final follow-up was 86.7 (73-96) out of 96, excluding scoring sexual intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: "Within ring"-based SIRF not including the lumbar spine in the fixation range is a simple, safe, and low-invasive internal fixation method for UPRI.},

abstract = {Hantaan virus (HTNV) infections can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, which is associated with high fatality rates. Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN-gamma-enzyme-linked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN-gamma-producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8-aa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996-aa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358-aa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 functions as an immunodominant protective epitope that may advance the design of safe and effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines for humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Targeting the endocannabinoid system has emerged as an effective strategy for the treatment of inflammatory and neurological diseases. Unlike the inhibition of the principal 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), which leads to 2-AG overload and cannabinoid receptor desensitization, selective inhibition of the minor 2-AG hydrolytic enzyme alpha, beta-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) can provide therapeutic benefits without producing cannabimimetic side effects. We have shown that inhibition of ABHD6 significantly reduces neuroinflammation and exerts neuroprotection in animal models of traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. However, the role of ABHD6 inhibition on neuropathic pain has not been explored. METHODS: Neuropathic pain was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the mouse sciatic nerve and examined by Hargreaves and Von Frey tests. Activation of inflammatory cells and the production of cytokines and chemokines in the spinal cord dorsal horn, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and sciatic nerve were assessed by qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry. The levels of 2-AG and arachidonic acid (AA) in sciatic nerve were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Treatment with the selective ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70 significantly alleviated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Microglia activation, macrophage infiltration, and the production of nociceptive mediators were reduced in the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn, DRG, and sciatic nerve of WWL70-treated animals. The diminished cytokine and chemokine production is likely due to the inhibitory effect of WWL70 on NF-kappaB phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of WWL70 were not reversed by addition of the cannabinoid receptor antagonists. Treatment with WWL70 did not alter the levels of 2-AG, AA, and the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), but significantly reduced the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E synthase-2 (PGES2) in the injured sciatic nerve. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a novel mechanism for the antinociceptive effect of the 2-AG catabolic enzyme ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70. Understanding the interaction between endocannabinoid and eicosanoid pathways might provide a new avenue for the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the variability among Turkish spinal surgeons in the management of thoracolumbar fractures by carrying out a web survey. METHODS: An invitation text and web-link of the survey were sent to the members of the Turkish Spine Society mail group. A fictitious spine trauma vignette, a 23 year-old male with a L1 burst fracture, was presented and 25 questions were asked to participants. Variability of answers in a given question was assessed with the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV). Questions with high IQV values ({\textgreater}{\%}80) were selected to evaluate the relation between participant factors (speciality, age, degree and experience level of the surgeon, type of the work centre and volume of the trauma patients). RESULTS: Sixty-four (88{\%}) among the 73 participating surgeons completed the survey. 45 (70{\%}) of them were orthopaedic surgeons and 19 (30{\%}) were neurosurgeons. 11 questions had very high variability (IQV {\textgreater}/= 0.80), 5 had high variability (0.58-0.75) and 2 had low variability (IQV{\textless}/=0.20). The question with the highest variability was related to the use of brace after surgery (IQV = 0.93). Following one was about the selection of fixation levels (IQV = 0.91). Neurosurgeons were more likely to use brace postoperatively and professors were less likely to perform decompression. CONCLUSION: This survey shows that thoracolumbar spine trauma practice significantly varies among Turkish spine surgeons. Surgeons' characteristics affected some specific answers. Lack of enough knowledge about spine trauma care, fracture classifications and surgical techniques and/or ethical factors may be other reasons for this variability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To formulate radiological indexes based on CT for further MRI examination to detect posterior ligamentous complex injury (PLC) or disc injury in thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit in the emergent setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a single thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were included into this study. Radiological indexes on CT included canal compromise (CC), anterior and posterior vertebral height ratio (PVH and AVH ratio), local kyphosis (LK) and regional kyphosis (RK). PLC and disc injury were assessed on MRI. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the predictive power for radiological indexes for any MRI findings either or both disc and PLC injury. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were included in this study. According to MRI, patients with no PLC and disc injury were allocated into MRI finding negative group, others were defined as positive group. There was no significant difference in AVH ratio, PVH ratio and RK between these two groups. The CC and LK were significant higher in positive group than that in negative group (p{\textless}0.001).The areas under receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.826 and 0.893 for CC and LK respectively and without significant difference. The best thresholds for CC and LK were 0.19 (sensitivity: 69.4{\%}; specificity: 87.5{\%}) and 14.00 degrees (sensitivity: 83.3{\%}; specificity: 83.3{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSION: The presence of CC{\textgreater}0.19 and/or LK{\textgreater}14.00 degrees on CT scan can predict MRI findings including PLC and disc injury. These thresholds may be the guideline for MRI examination in patients with neurologically intact thoracolumbar burst fracture in the emergent condition.},

abstract = {Background: The failure rate for the closed/non-surgical treatment of thoracic and lumbar vertebral body fractures (TLVBF) in trauma patients has not been adequately evaluated utilizing computed tomography (CT) studies. Methods: From 2007 to 2008, consecutive trauma patients, who met inclusion criteria, with a CT diagnosis of acute TLVBF undergoing closed treatment were assessed. The failure rates for closed therapy, at 3 months post-trauma, were defined by progressive deformity, vertebral body collapse, or symptomatic/asymptomatic pseudarthrosis. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification was utilized to classify the fractures (groups A1 and non-A1 fractures) and were successively followed with CT studies. Results: There were 54 patients with 91 fractures included in the study; 66 were A1 fractures, and 25 were non-A1 fractures. All had rigid bracing applied with flat and upright X-ray films performed to rule out instability. None had sustained spinal cord injuries. Thirteen patients (24{\%}) failed closed therapy [e.g. 13 failed fractures (14{\%}) out of 91 total fractures]. Five failed radiographically only (asymptomatic), and eight failed radiographically and clinically (symptomatic). A1 fractures had a 4.5{\%} failure rate, while non-A1 fractures failed at a rate of 40{\%}. Conclusion: Failure of closed therapy for TLVBF in the trauma population is not insignificant. Non-A1 fractures had a much higher failure rate when compared to A1 fractures. We recommend close follow-up particularly of non-A1 fractures treated in closed fashion using successive CT studies.},

abstract = {Study Design: Retrospective cohort. Purpose: To review the clinical presentation  of operated patients with delayed neurological deficits after osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs). Overview of Literature: Delayed neurological deficits can occur from 1 week to 5.7 months after OVFs. Baba has reported 78{\%} good-to-excellent improvement (i.e., {\textgreater}/=50{\%}) after 20 posterior (Cotrel-Dubousset) and 7 anterior (Kaneda in 4, Zielke ventral derotational spondylodesis in 2, and un-instrumented anterior fusion in 1) fusions. Predictive factors for neurological deficits include burst type, vacuum sign, kyphosis, angular instability, and retropulsion. Methods: Patients with neurological deficits after OVF who received spinal operations between 2000 and 2016 were included. Results: Totally, 28 patients with a mean age of 77 years underwent surgery. Neurological deficits occurred at an average of 5.4 weeks after the onset of back pain. The most common site was L1. Burst fracture was present in 14 patients and vacuum sign in seven. Surgery was performed within an average of 3.9 days of the onset of neurological deficit. Baba's score improved significantly from 5.96 to 9.81, with good-to-excellent improvement in 18 (64{\%}) patients. Better outcomes based on Baba's scores (improvement{\textgreater}60{\%} [median]) were associated with compression fractures, preoperative retropulsion of {\textless}41{\%}, and correction of {\textgreater}16{\%}. Poor improvement in Baba's scores ({\textless}25{\%}) was associated with surgical complications and burst fracture type. Twenty-two patients (79{\%}) regained walking ability, and seven of 15 (47{\%}) patients demonstrated improved sphincter control at the latest follow-up. Six Frankel grade B patients did not achieve neurological recovery, four of whom exhibited postoperative surgical complications and died at 2 years because of medical problems. Implant migration occurred in six patients, albeit this was of no clinical significance. Conclusions: Although OVFs are commonly considered benign, delayed neurological deficits can occur. The significant improvement in clinical function after surgery for neurological deficits is associated with compression (and not burst) fractures, lack of surgical complications, and optimal restoration of retropulsion.},

abstract = {Background: Treatment for displaced proximal humeral fractures is still under debate. Poor rotator cuff status and non-union of the tubercles in elderly patients has caused reversed total shoulder prosthesis growing popularity and showed promising results, even in comparison to angular stable plates fixation.The purpose of this study is to report clinical and radiological results of proximal humerus fractures treated with rTSA or ORIF in elderly. Materials and methods: The study has investigated retrospectively a consecutive series of 73 patients over 65 years old (range 65-91) with proximal humeral three- and four- parts fractures, operated from January 2009 to June 2014 with a reversed total shoulder prosthetic replacement or open reduction and internal fixation using an angular stable plate, with at least 1 year follow-up. Participants are admitted in our hospital with a displaced proximal humeral fracture according to AO-OTA type 11-B2 or 11-C2.The primary outcomes are active ROM and shoulder function (Constant score). Secondary outcomes have been patient self-assessment form (Simple shoulder test) and radiographical details. Follow-up takes place at the moment of clinical observation with rx control. Results: We analyzed a group of 23 patients treated by plate and screws and 21 patients treated by rTSA with these average results. ORIF: Flexion 112.8 degrees , Abduction 99.6 degrees , External rotation at 90 degrees 47.4 degrees , modal Internal rotation hand at Sacroiliac joint, Constant Score 52.9 and Simple Shoulder Test 8.0. RSA: Flexion 133.3 degrees , Abduction 101.4 degrees , External rotation at 90 degrees of abduction 35.5 degrees , modal Internal rotation hand at waist (L3), Constant Score 65.9 and Simple Shoulder Test 9.2. No nerve injuries were reported. No cases of pseudoarthrosis or plate fractures. No arthroplasty implant loosening, infection or dislocation was documented and revision required. Conclusion: Our study shows good clinical outcomes and fewer complications in both treatment options. Better clinical and daily living results are reported in RSA compared with ORIF, confirming that rTSA is one of the best treatment in proximal humeral fractures in the elderly patients, which rotator cuff status frequently is poor and degenerating. The few radiological complications do not seem to have influence on active ROM and Constant Score, both the first and the second group of patients. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Surgical.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the fixation power of sacroiliac rod fixation (SIRF), which was developed based on our original "within ring" concept to exclude the lumbar vertebra from the fixation range, and spinopelvic fixation (SPF) in a biomechanical experiment. METHODS: SPF and SIRF were applied to the posterior element in four bones each with the pelvic ring fracture model (AO/OTA classification 61-C1.3). A 300-N axial force was loaded on the fifth lumbar vertebra of the simulated pelvis. Then the stiffness (N/m) and deformation (mm) of SPF and SIRF were determined, and the final displacement (mm) of the fracture region and angular deformity (degrees) were measured. Displacements were measured using the markers at two sites of the sacral fracture [upper margin of the sacral ala (Ala) and second sacral vertebra level (S2)] and one site of the pubic symphysis (PS), and angular deformity was measured at Ala and PS. RESULTS: In SPF and SIRF, the mean stiffnesses and deformations showed no statistically significant difference. Only the vertical displacement at Ala differed significantly between SPF and SIRF (p = 0. 045), and the fixing force of SPF was higher. There was no other significant difference in vertical and horizontal displacement. The mean angular deformities also showed no significant difference between the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: In biomechanics experiments, vertical resistance was stronger in SPF-treated than SIRF-treated bone, but stiffness and deformation, horizontal resistance, and angular deformity did not differ significantly.},

abstract = {The treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction burst fractures remains a controversial issue. We evaluate the efficacy of short segment (SS) compared with that of long-segment (LS) stabilization in terms of clinical and the radiological outcomes. Records of 88 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation from January 2004 to December 2015, studied retrospectively. These patients were divided into two groups: SS and the LS-group. Clinical parameters: back pain, disability, neurological deficit and radiologic parameters: Cobb angle, sagittal index, the kyphotic deformation of vertebral body, vertebral height and canal compromise were measured before surgery and immediately after surgery and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Overall outcomes were evaluated using the modified Mcnab criteria at the last follow-up. Chi-squared test and paired-t test were used for statistical analysis using SPSS. There were 36 and 52 patients in the SS and LS- group, respectively. The mean age of the patients was 30.6+/-8.4 and 33.4+/-8.4 years and the mean follow-up period was 24.5 and 16.8 months in SS and LS-group respectively. In the SS-group, the fractured vertebral body level was L1, T12, L2, T11 and T10 in 15, 10, 6, 3 and 2 cases and LS- group, the fractured vertebral body level was L1, T12, L2, T11 and T10 in 22, 17, 5, 5 and 3 cases, respectively. Both groups achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes according to the modified Mcnab criteria. In the SS-group, 8(22.22{\%}), 21(58.33{\%}) and 7(19.44{\%}) cases were considered to have excellent, good and fair outcome and LS-group, 18(34.61{\%}), 25(48.08{\%}), 6(11.54{\%}) and 3(5.77{\%}) cases were considered to have excellent, good, fair, and poor outcome, respectively. Short-segment pedicle screw fixation including the fractured vertebral body might be as effective as long-segment pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction burst fracture.},

abstract = {Background: To determine the relationship between superior disc-endplate complex  injury and correction loss after surgery in a group of young adult patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture. Methods: The study group was comprised of young adult patients who had undergone short-segment posterior fixation and bone grafting under the diagnosis of a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture from March 2008 to February 2014. Follow-up was available for more than 1 year. Before surgery, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, and superior and inferior intervertebral discs and endplates. Correction loss was evaluated by the Cobb angle, intervertebral disc height, upper intervertebral disc angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body height. Results: No significant relation was noted between correction loss and an injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, inferior intervertebral disc/endplate, and fracture site, whereas an injury to the superior endplate alone and superior disc-endplate complex showed a significant association. Specifically, a superior intervertebral disc-endplate complex injury showed statistically significant relation to postoperative changes in Cobb angle (p = 0.026) and vertebral wedge angle (p = 0.047). Conclusions: A superior intervertebral disc-endplate complex injury may have an influence on the prognosis after short-segment fixation in young adult patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {Thoracolumbar malunion is the result of loss of correction, insufficient correction or even no correction (both in the frontal and sagittal planes) of a thoracolumbar fracture. The main causes are incorrect assessment of the fracture's complexity (burst fracture), its potential progression to kyphosis and associated disc or ligament damage. It can also be the result of a poorly conducted initial treatment. The types of malunion have changed over the years because of the introduction of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The malunion can be well tolerated if there is only a moderate deformity. However, the functional and pain-related limitations can be severe with large deformities. Functional limitation is mainly related to sagittal imbalance, but also to sequelae associated with the injury in various ways (non-union, disc degeneration, spinal cord compression, syringomyelia, etc.). The deformity and its consequences are evaluated globally using full-body standing radiographs (EOS), CT scan and MRI. Comparison of MRI images taken in a lying position to weight bearing views or even dynamic ones is an additional means to evaluate whether the lesions are reducible. Differences in spine morphology and compensatory mechanisms to combat the sagittal imbalance induced by the deformity must also be analyzed. These provide more complete information about the consequences of the malunion and help to establish the best corrective strategy. These compensatory mechanisms consist of accentuation of lumbar lordosis along with reduction of thoracic kyphosis. As a last resort, the pelvis and femur contribute to this compensation when there is a large deformity or a stiff spine due to preexisting osteoarthritis. Treatment strategies are fairly well standardized. When the deformity is reducible, a two-stage surgery is indicated. When the deformity is not reducible, posterior transpedicular closed wedge osteotomy is the gold standard. Nevertheless, the best way to treat thoracolumbar malunion is to prevent it.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This paper describes surgical options for Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) with acute flexible or chronic rigid kyphosis, and pseudarthrosis complicated with pain and neurologic deficit. METHODS: This study has two components. a) A prospective clinical study of surgical treatment of 31 patients (age: 69+/-11 years) with either acute flexible or progressive pseudarthrotic kyphosis manifested with severe pain or neurological deficit between 2010 and 2014. Eleven patients exhibited neurocompression (Frankel B, C, D). Surgery consisted in indirect reduction, kyphoplasty, and short posterior instrumentation in 28 patients and multilevel instrumentation in three. b) The second component involved a literature search of OVCF complicated with acute or painful chronic deformities and neurologic deficit, managed with open surgical approach. RESULTS: Indirect reduction, kyphoplasty and short posterior stabilization can restore satisfactory anatomic alignment and neurological deficit. Multilevel instrumentation was used for rigid long kyphosis. Complications were related to a) screw pull out and junctional kyphosis (4 patients) one of the patients also developed anterior migration of cement, b) cement leakage (4 patients). L5 radiculopathy occurred in one patient. The others remained asymptomatic. The literature review concluded that corpectomy with anterior, posterior or combined instrumentations is indicated for burst fractures, or rigid kyphosis with neurocompression. Prompt decompression with anatomical alignment may restore paraplegia. Complications were germane to osteoporotic bone predisposing to hardware loosening or cut out and dislodgement of instrumentation. DISCUSSION: Neurologic deficit associated with fractures or progressive pseudarthrotic kyphosis effectively may respond to indirect postural reduction, kyphoplasty and posterior percutaneous short segment transpedicle instrumentation. For burst fractures and rigid chronic kyphosis corpectomy reconstructed with cages and anterior, or posterior or combined instrumentations can restore and maintain normal anatomy. The following guidelines for optimal surgical instrumentation have been established: To prevent screw loosening and junctional kyphosis the instrumentation should not end within the kyphotic segment. Screws for anterior instrumentation should penetrate the contralateral cortex. Multiple site of fixation or combined anterior and posterior instrumentations dissipate stresses at any one site. Augmentation of transpedicle screw fixation with cement is a sound technical principle. Cement should inserted in a doughy state with minimal pressure to prevent cement complications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study reports the epidemiology, clinical aspects, and management of spinal trauma in children and adolescents. METHODS: Multicenter study of 215 cases of spinal trauma in individuals {\textless}18 years of age. All patients were submitted to preoperative and postoperative radiologic and clinical evaluation. The fractures were classified according to the AOSpine fracture classification. Neurological evaluation was performed using the Frankel scale at admission to hospital and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Mean age was 14.7 (+/- 2.5) years and most of the patients were male (72.6{\%}). Falls were responsible for 52.6{\%} of the spinal trauma. Compression fracture was the most common type of fracture, observed in 48.4{\%} of the cases. Most spinal fractures were located at the thoracic level (58.7{\%}). Associated injuries were observed in 37.2{\%} of the cases. The complication rates were 15.8{\%}. Normal neurological examination was observed in 160 cases (74.4{\%}) at the final follow-up. Neurological impairment was mostly observed due to shallow water diving, dislocation fractures types, and fractures located between the lower cervical spine and the thoracic spine. Surgical treatment was performed in 73.8{\%} of the cases. Better neurological outcome was observed in fractures due to falls, fractures located in the upper cervical (C1-C2) and lower lumbar spine injuries (L3-L5). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment is often necessary in children and adolescents after spinal trauma. Higher incidence of spinal cord injury was observed after shallow water diving, fractures located in the lower cervical spine and thoracic spine, and type B and C fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with laminar fractures have a higher chance of experiencing  severe trauma and neurologic deficit. In previous studies, laminar fractures were divided into different types based on the axial plane of computed tomographic scans. No report described the morphology of vertical laminar fractures in the coronal plane. Furthermore, the correlation between a specific type of laminar fracture and the extent of severity of thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures has rarely been mentioned. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 341 patients with TL burst fractures with or without laminar fractures were divided into 6 groups based on the morphology observed across reconstructed coronal and axial computed tomographic planes. The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS), Load Sharing Classification (LSC), and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale were evaluated for each patient. Intergroup comparisons were also performed for all metrics. RESULTS: The TLICS, LSC, and ASIA impairment scale were determined for each laminar fracture group. Statistical differences were found in most intergroup comparisons across all metrics. Significantly higher injury scores were observed in the groups with a more severe coronal and axial laminar fracture, and the injury severity in the coronal scan played a more decisive role. CONCLUSIONS: The morphology of vertical laminar fractures as observed across multiple image planes was more complex and accurate than an analysis based solely on the axial plane. Different morphologies indicated differences in the severity of associated TL burst fractures. The laminar fracture in the coronal plane was associated with the severity of spinal injury.},

abstract = {KEY POINTS: Spinal compression injury targeted to the neonatal upper lumbar spinal cord, the region of highest hindlimb locomotor rhythmogenicity, leads to an initial paralysis of the hindlimbs. Behavioural recovery is evident within a few days and approaches normal function within about 3 weeks. Fictive locomotion in the isolated injured spinal cord cannot be elicited by a neurochemical cocktail containing NMDA, dopamine and serotonin 1 day post-injury, but can 3 days post-injury as readily as in the uninjured spinal cord. Low frequency coordinated rhythmic activity can be elicited in the isolated uninjured spinal cord by NMDA + dopamine (without serotonin), but not in the isolated injured spinal cord. In both the injured and uninjured spinal cord, eliciting bona fide fictive locomotion requires the additional presence of serotonin. ABSTRACT: Following incomplete compression injury in the thoracic spinal cord of neonatal mice 1 day after birth (P1), we previously reported that virtually normal hindlimb locomotor function is recovered within about 3 weeks despite substantial permanent thoracic tissue loss. Here, we asked whether similar recovery occurs following lumbar injury that impacts more directly on the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG). As in thoracic injuries, lumbar injuries caused about 90{\%} neuronal loss at the injury site and increased serotonergic innervation below the injury. Motor recovery was slower after lumbar than thoracic injury, but virtually normal function was attained by P25 in both cases. Locomotor CPG status was tested by eliciting fictive locomotion in isolated spinal cords using a widely used neurochemical cocktail (NMDA, dopamine, serotonin). No fictive locomotion could be elicited 1 day post-injury, but could within 3 days post-injury as readily as in age-matched uninjured control spinal cords. Burst patterning and coordination were largely similar in injured and control spinal cords but there were differences. Notably, in both groups there were two main locomotor frequencies, but injured spinal cords exhibited a shift towards the higher frequency. Injury also altered the neurochemical dependence of locomotor CPG output, such that injured spinal cords, unlike control spinal cords, were incapable of generating low frequency rhythmic coordinated activity in the presence of NMDA and dopamine alone. Thus, the neonatal spinal cord also exhibits remarkable functional recovery after lumbar injuries, but the neurochemical sensitivity of locomotor circuitry is modified in the process.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relevance of blood supply for bone fracture healing has been discussed throughout the literature, using scaphoids as the most referred to. But, there is virtually nothing known about the relevance of blood supply for the vertebral fracture healing and even the guidelines of AO do not deal with this issue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 107 patients was run from January 2016 to December 2016, with 54 male and 53 female patients, who were treated for traumatic vertebral fractures of thoracolumbar spine using posterior stabilization only. The average age was 67 years and the follow-up 12.3 weeks. The total number of vertebrae was 129. We analyzed the fracture morphology and measured the vertebral bodies in all three dimensions, with five reference planes. The progress of vertebral deformity in time measured before and after the surgery was correlated with the potential damage of the main vascular canal in the rear of each vertebral body. The bone pattern and morphology were analyzed in detail as well. Pathological fractures were not taken into our consideration. RESULTS: The overall deformity progression of vertebral bodies in the fractures with morphologically damaged blood supply was in all measured dimensions significantly higher than in the fractures with supposedly maintained perfusion. The osteoporosis played its role as well, but only with medium effect size compared with strong effect size of the vessel canal damage (Cohen). The combination of the both factors (damage to the vessel canal together with osteoporosis) showed also a strong correlation with a relevant deformity progression (Evans), but not much different from the vessel canal damage alone. With regard to the relevant changes of the vertebral body dimensions/volume, we found relevant changes in 52{\%} of all fractures (SD 0.5017) generally, for the subgroup with the canal damage in 84{\%} (SD 0.3691), with strong correlation (Evans, 0.7721). In the group of fractures with maintained perfusion, we found such changes in only in 5{\%} of fractures (SD 0.2333). CONCLUSION: For decision making, we should take mechanical fracture analysis and dynamic processes within traumatized tissue a part of whose is the blood supply and oxygenation into surgical consideration. We recommend anterior rather than posterior stabilization for the cases with damaged vessel canal, and the vertebroplasty could pose an alternative in the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The load sharing classification (LSC) laid foundations for a  scoring system able to indicate which thoracolumbar fractures, after short-segment posterior-only fixations, would need longer instrumentations or additional anterior supports. PURPOSE: We analyzed surgically treated thoracolumbar fractures, quantifying the vertebral body's fragment displacement with the aim of identifying a new parameter that could predict the posterior-only construct failure. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study from a single institution. PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients were surgically treated for thoracolumbar burst fractures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Grade of kyphosis correction (GKC) expressed radiological outcome; Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale were considered. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients who underwent posterior fixation for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrospectively evaluated clinically and radiologically. Supplementary anterior fixations were performed in 34 cases with posterior instrumentation failure, determined on clinic-radiological evidence or symptomatic loss of kyphosis correction. Segmental kyphosis angle and GKC were calculated according to the Cobb method. The displacement of fracture fragments was obtained from the mean of the adjacent end plate areas subtracted from the area enclosed by the maximum contour of vertebral fragmentation. The "spread" was derived from the ratio between this subtraction and the mean of the adjacent end plate areas. Analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney, and receiver operating characteristic were performed for statistical analysis. The authors report no conflict of interest concerning the materials or methods used in the present study or the findings specified in this paper. No funds or grants have been received for the present study. RESULTS: The spread revealed to be a helpful quantitative measurement of vertebral body fragment displacement, easily reproducible with the current computed tomography (CT) imaging technologies. There were no failures of posterior fixations with preoperative spreads {\textless}42{\%} and losses of correction (LOC){\textless}10 degrees , whereas spreads {\textgreater}62.7{\%} required supplementary anterior supports whenever LOC{\textgreater}10 degrees were recorded. Most of the patients in a "gray zone," with spreads between 42{\%} and 62.7{\%}, needed additional anterior supports because of clinical-radiological evidence of impending mechanical failures, which developed independently from the GKC. Preoperative kyphosis (p{\textless}.001), load sharing score (p=.002), and spread (p{\textless}.001) significantly affected the final surgical treatment (posterior or circumferential). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-two years after the LSC, both improvements in spinal stabilization systems and software imaging innovations have modified surgical concepts and approach on spinal trauma care. Spread was found to be an additional tool that could help in predicting the posterior construct failure, providing an objective preoperative indicator, easily reproducible with the modern viewers for CT images.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: If surgery for thoracolumbar incomplete cranial burst fractures (Magerl  A3.1.1) is necessary, the ideal stabilization strategy still remains undetermined. To justify posterior-anterior stabilization, which generates higher costs and potentially higher morbidity vs. posterior-only stabilization, clinical trials with sufficient power and adequate methodology are required. This prospective randomized single-centre pilot trial was designed to enable sufficient sample-size calculation for a randomized multicentre clinical trial (RASPUTHINE). METHODS: Patients with a traumatic thoracolumbar (Th11-L2) incomplete burst fracture (Magerl A3.1.1) were randomly assigned either to the interventional group (posterior-anterior) or to the control group (posterior-only). Primary endpoint of the study was the clinical outcome measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 24 months. Radiological outcome was assessed as secondary endpoint by evaluation of mono- and bisegmental kyphotic angulation and monosegmental fusion. RESULTS: 21 patients were randomly assigned to interventional group (n = 9) or control group (n = 12). One posterior-only treated patient showed a severe initial loss of correction resulting in a crossover to additional anterior bisegmental fusion. The ODI measures at the primary study endpoint showed less but insignificant (p = 0.67) disability for the interventional group over the control group (13.3 vs. 19.3{\%}). Comparison of preoperative bisegmental kyphosis in supine position with the bisegmental kyphosis at 24-month FU in upright position showed a worsened kyphosis for the control group (10.7 degrees --{\textgreater} 15.6 degrees ), whereas an improved kyphosis (11 degrees --{\textgreater} 8.3 degrees ) was detectable for the interventional group. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot RCT showed less disability for the posterior-anterior group linked with a significant better restoration of the sagittal profile in comparison with the posterior-only group. To detect a clinically significant difference using the ODI and assuming a 20{\%} loss of FU rate, a total of 266 patients have to be studied in the multicentre trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebral body fractures (VBF) can be caused by various trauma mechanisms. The AOSpine classification system differentiates three main types of fractures according to the grade of instability. How the increasing energy of various accident mechanisms changes the complexity of the individual fracture, its localization and the occurrence of further fractures has not yet been finally investigated. OBJECTIVE: What influence do traumatic events with different kinematics have on the localization, complexity and number of VBF in the thoracic and lumbar spine? MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study data from patients with a freshly traumatized VBF were analyzed. The patients were divided into six trauma groups (UFG) depending on the trauma mechanism. The VBF were classified on the basis of computed tomography (CT) imaging according to the AOSpine classification system. Testing was performed bilaterally and a significance level of 5{\%} was used. The statistical calculations were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics. RESULTS: A significant increase in the severity of fractures (AO classification) was found in the high energy trauma groups (UFG III and V). In addition, the incidence of thoracic (TH) VBF was significantly increased for TH7 (p = 0.011) and TH10 (p = 0.001). In comparison to the other low energy trauma groups, the risk of a TH7 fracture was 7times higher after a high energy trauma (odds ratio OR = 7.0; 95{\%} confidence interval CI = 1.4; 35.2). The UFG III (falls {\textgreater} 3 m) showed the highest number of fractures with a median of 2.5 (SD 1.84) VBF. CONCLUSION: An exact reproduction of the traumatic event enables a distinction between high and low energy trauma groups to be made. In previous studies traffic accidents were recorded as one group, so an influence of the increasing kinematic energy could not be assessed. The accident kinematics can be taken into account by differentiating between high and low-energy trauma groups. In high-energy accidents the TH7 and TH10 vertebrae were found to be at risk vertebrae. In addition to the force direction, the force strength also has a decisive influence on the distribution pattern of VBF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The "gold standard" for instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations is pedicle screw and rod fixation. Although traditional treatment supports long-segment posterior fixation (LSPF), more recent studies show short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) may be effective, but incur higher failure rates. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of SSPF in the management of unstable thoracolumbar injuries and analyzed the factors impacting long-term outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of 91 patients with thoracolumbar fractures managed with SSPF alone, we assessed the clinical and radiological parameters at preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up intervals along with reasons for failures of SSPF. RESULTS: We analyzed 91 patients (mean age: 33.5 years; Male: Female = 50:41) with thoracolumbar fractures treated with SSPF over a median follow-up period of 30 months. SSPF failures were observed in 26 of 91 (28.6{\%}) patients; the median time to implant failure was 17 months. On univariate analysis, statistically significant factors contributing to failure of SSPF included the presence of a burst fracture, a preoperative LSC (load-sharing classification) score {\textgreater}6, and translation/dislocation. With multinomial regression analysis, the only factor predictive for SSPF failure was the patients' postoperative ambulatory status. CONCLUSION: Patients with thoracolumbar facture dislocations, subjected to axial spinal loading postoperatively, should not be considered for SSPF alone. The following factors also contributed to SSPF failures: a burst fracture, a preoperative LSC score of {\textgreater}6, and/or presence of transverse dislocation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This case-control study was designed to test the hypothesis whether carpal tunnel release (CTR) during fixation of distal radius 23-C2 AO fractures improves outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients who sustained distal radius fractures of the dominant hand participated in this study. Patients were allocated into two groups: (a) The ORIF + CTR (16 patients (11 males and 5 females)); (b) the ORIF and NOT CTR 19 patients (12 males and 7 females). Patient assessment included visual analogic scale of pain (VAS), the subjective Mayo Wrist Score (MWS), electromyograms (EMG) at 3 month and 6 months from the day of injury and complications. All patients had the same physiotherapy treatment algorithm following surgery. Patient follow up took place at 1 month, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: A the T12 month follow up point the VAS average was 0.8 (range 0-3) in ORIF + CTR group compared to 1.2 (range 0-3) in the ORIF and NOT CTR. The MWS average was 98.7 (range 95-100) in ORIF + CTR group versus 97.6 (range 95-100) in ORIF no CTR group. There was no statistical significance (p {\textgreater} 0.5) between the two groups during the follow up period. Patients in the sixth month of ORIF + CTR had no suffering of the median nerve, while 31.58{\%} of patients in ORIF and no CTR found to have carpal tunnel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Routine release of the transverse carpal ligament at the time of fracture fixation may reduce the incidence of postoperative median nerve dysfunction.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Review and technical report. OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative ultrasound has been used by spine surgeons since the early 1980s. Since that time, more advanced modes of intraoperative imaging and navigation have become widely available. Although the use of ultrasound during spine surgery has fallen out of favor, it remains the only true real-time imaging modality that allows surgeons to visualize soft tissue anatomy instantly and continuously while operating. It is our objective to demonstrate that for this reason, ultrasound is a useful adjunctive technique for spine surgeons, especially when approaching intradural lesions or when addressing pathology in the ventral spinal canal via a posterior approach. METHODS: Using PubMed, the existing literature regarding the use of intraoperative ultrasound during spinal surgery was evaluated. Also, surgical case logs were reviewed to identify spinal operations during which intraoperative ultrasound was used. Illustrative cases were selected and reviewed in detail. RESULTS: This article provides a brief review of the history of intraoperative ultrasound in spine surgery and describes certain surgical scenarios during which this technique might be useful. Several illustrative cases are provided from our own experience. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should consider the use of intraoperative ultrasound when approaching intradural lesions or when addressing pathology ventral to the thecal sac via a posterior approach.},

abstract = {In the present study, we searched for possible candidates that can prevent ischemic damage in the rabbit spinal cord. For this study, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in sham- and ischemia-operated animals. As the level of protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3) significantly decreased 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion, we further investigated its possible role against ischemic damage using an in vitro spinal cord cell line and in vivo spinal cord ischemic model. The administration of Tat-PDIA3 significantly reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and cell death, based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end labeling and a colorimetric WST-1 assay. Further, Tat-PDIA3 significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced deficits in motor function, based on Tarlov's criteria, 24-72 h after ischemia/reperfusion, as well as the degeneration of motor neurons in the ventral horn 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. Tat-PDIA3 administration also reduced the ischemia-induced activation of microglia and lipid peroxidation in the motor neurons 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. PDIA3 also potentially ameliorated the ischemia-induced increase in oxidative markers in serum and decreased the activity of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in spinal cord homogenates, 24 h and 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that Tat-PDIA3 could be used to protect spinal cord neurons from ischemic damage, due to its modulatory action on the oxidative/anti-oxidative balance. Tat-PDIA3 could be applicable to protects neurons from the ischemic damage induced by thoracoabdominal aorta obstruction.},

abstract = {Importance: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is  a percutaneous transfemoral balloon technique used in select centers for resuscitation and temporary hemostasis, often instead of emergency department thoracotomy. The ability to perform aortic occlusion (AO) with an intravascular device allows focused occlusion at the most distal level to perfuse proximal regions while slowing hemorrhage to injured areas. Objective: To describe what is to date the largest single-institution experience with REBOA in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: Use of REBOA at an urban tertiary care facility for severe traumatic hemorrhage, traumatic arrest (AR), or nontraumatic hemorrhage (NTH) was investigated from February 1, 2013, to January 31, 2017, among 90 patients who were not responsive or were transiently responsive to resuscitation measures, or were in arrest, from presumed hemorrhage below the diaphragm. Possible causes were trauma or nontrauma-related hemorrhage. Patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 90 patients in the study (15 women and 75 men; mean [SD] age, 41.5 [17.4] years), 29 underwent REBOA for severe traumatic hemorrhage, 50 for AR, and 11 for NTH. For the patients with severe traumatic hemorrhage and AR, the median age was 36.2 years (interquartile range, 25.3-55.5 years), mean (SD) admission Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 (5), and median Injury Severity Score was 39 (interquartile range, 10-75). The distal thoracic aorta was occluded in 73 patients (81{\%}), and in all patients with AR. A total of 17 patients (19{\%}) had distal abdominal AO. Mean (SD) systolic blood pressure improved in patients with severe traumatic hemorrhage, from 68 (28) mm Hg prior to AO, to 131 (12) mm Hg after AO (P {\textless} .001). Percutaneous access was used in 30 patients (33{\%}), including 13 patients with AR (26{\%}), and groin cutdown in 60 patients (67{\%}), including 37 patients with AR (74{\%}). Overall 30-day mortality was 62{\%} (n = 56): 11 (39{\%}) in patients with severe traumatic hemorrhage and 45 (90{\%}) in patients with AR. Of the patients with AR, 29 (58{\%}) had return of spontaneous circulation and 11 of those patients (38{\%}) survived to the operating room. All patients who survived AR gained full neurologic recovery. No aortoiliac injury or limb loss occurred from REBOA use. Eleven patients underwent REBOA for NTH; 7 (64{\%}) were in arrest. Overall in-hospital mortality for patients with NTH was 36{\%} (n = 4). No procedural complications occurred in this group. Conclusions and Relevance: REBOA is a minimally invasive alternative to emergency department thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamp to temporize noncompressible torso hemorrhage and obtain proximal control in both traumatic and nontraumatic causes of hemorrhage. REBOA can also be used for more targeted AO in the distal aorta for pelvic, junctional, or extremity hemorrhage.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To reveal the risk factors for dural tears in thoracic and lumbar (TL) burst fractures associated with vertical laminar fractures through multivariate analysis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Dural tears associated with laminar fractures in patients with TL burst fractures represents a special group requires distinct treatment with different surgical prognosis. It is still very difficult to predict dural tears in patients with vertical laminar fractures. The risk factors for dural tears have seldom been evaluated. METHODS: Medical records of 113 patients of TL burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures were reviewed. The data were subdivided into two groups consisting of patients with and without dural tears. Demographic information, preoperative clinical, and radiological characteristics were compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to determine the independent risk factors for dural tears. RESULTS: The incidence of dural tear was 27.4{\%} in this retrospective cohort. When compared with the dural intact group, the dural tear group had significantly worse preoperative neurological status, wider interpedicular distance, greater separation of laminar fractures, and larger encroachment of retropulsed fragment in the bony spinal canal. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the ratio of interpedicular distance greater than 125{\%} (odds ratio = 9.5; P {\textless} 0.001) and the ratio of encroachment of retropulsed fragment in the bony spinal canal of more than 50{\%} (odds ratio = 61.2; P {\textless} 0.001) were independent risk factors for dural tears. CONCLUSION: Patients with wider interpedicular distance and larger encroachment of retropulsed fragment in the bony spinal canal were more likely to have dural tears in TL burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fractures represent a significant proportion of fractures of the thoracolumbar junction. The recent advent of minimally invasive techniques has revolutionized the surgical treatment of this type of fracture. However mechanical behaviour and primary stability offered by these solutions have to be proved from experimental validation tests on cadaveric specimens. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an original and reproducible model of burst fracture under dynamic impact. METHODS: Experimental tests were performed on 24 cadaveric spine segments (T11-L3). A system of dynamic loading was developed using a modified Charpy pendulum. The mechanical response of the segments (strain measurement on vertebrae and discs) was obtained during the impact by using an optical method with a high-speed camera. The production of burst fracture was validated by an analysis of the segments by X-ray tomography. FINDINGS: Burst fracture was systematically produced on L1 for each specimen. Strain analysis during impact highlighted the large deformation of L1 due to the fracture and small strains in adjacent vertebrae. The mean reduction of the vertebral body of L1 assessed for all the specimens was around 15{\%}. No damage was observed in adjacent discs or vertebrae. INTERPRETATION: With this new, reliable and replicable procedure for production and biomechanical analysis of burst fractures, comparison of different types of stabilization systems can be envisaged. The loading system was designed so as to be able to produce loads leading to other types of fractures and to provide data to validate finite element modelling.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE: To review the feasibility of a posterior-only approach for instrumented reconstruction in lumbar burst fractures. BACKGROUND: Burst fractures of the lumbar spine have been treated through a variety of techniques, including anterior, posterior, or combined approaches. Here we review series of patients undergoing posterior-only transpedicular corpectomy with instrumented fusion for traumatic lumbar burst fracture. METHODS: All patients treated at the Los Angeles County+University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Medical Center who had sustained traumatic lumbar burst fractures from February 2005 to February 2014 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 178 traumatic lumbar burst fractures were identified of which 89 required operative intervention. Of those 89 operations, 7 patients underwent posterior-only approach for transpedicular corpectomy. Levels operated on were at L1 (4 patients), L2 (1 patient), and L4 (2 patients). The mean age was 35 years of age (range, 21-56 y), and mechanism of injury was either motor vehicle accident (5 patients) or fall (2 patients). Initial neurological examination was American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) B in 3 patients, ASIA D in 3 patients, and 1 patient was neurologically intact. Mean thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score on presentation was 6.4 (range, 5-8), whereas the mean load sharing classification score was 7.4 (range, 7-9). Of patients who were not immediately lost to follow-up on hospital discharge, mean clinical follow-up was 45.3 months (range, 18.8-68.6 mo), whereas mean radiographic follow-up was 28.8 months (range, 1.3-63.6 mo). At the last known radiographic follow-up, no patient had gross hardware fracture, pseudoarthrosis, or adjacent segment disease. One patient with the longest radiographic follow-up of 63.6 months was noted to have some minimal subsidence of his cage with no other change in his other hardware. CONCLUSION: A posterior-only approach for transpedicular corpectomy and instrumented fusion is a viable treatment option for lumbar burst fracture which allows for reconstruction of the anterior column while avoiding many of the risks and complications associated with an anterior or combined approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fracture is a common thoracolumbar injury that is treated using posterior pedicle instrumentation and fusion combined with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting after reduction. In this study, we compared the outcome of these two techniques by using radiologic imaging and functional outcome. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fracture were operated with kyphoplasty (n = 31) or vertebroplasty (n = 30) and retrospectively reviewed in our institution between 2011 and 2014. All 61 patients underwent surgery within 5 days after admission to the hospital and then followed-up for 12 to 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: Significant improvement was found in the anterior vertebral height (92 +/- 8.9{\%} in the kyphoplasty group, 85.6 +/- 7.2{\%} in the vertebroplasty group, p {\textless} 0.01) at 1 month post-operatively and (89 +/- 7.9{\%} in the kyphoplasty group, 78 +/- 6.9{\%} in the vertebroplasty group, p {\textless} 0.01) at the 24-month follow-up. Significant improvement was also observed in the kyphotic angle (1.2 +/- 0.5 degrees in the kyphoplasty group, 10.5 +/- 1.2 degrees in the vertebroplasty group, p {\textless} 0.01) at 1 month post-operatively and (5.4 +/- 1.2 degrees in the kyphoplasty group, 11.5 +/- 8.5 degrees in the vertebroplasty group, p {\textless} 0.01) at the 24-month follow-up. Both operations led to significant improvement of the patients' pain and the Oswestry disability index (p {\textless} 0.01). Cement leakage was noted in 29{\%} of patients after kyphoplasty and 77{\%} of patients after vertebroplasty (p {\textless} 0.01). Only one implant failure (3.3{\%}), which required further surgical intervention, was reported in the vertebroplasty group. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction with additional balloon at the fractured site is better than indirect reduction only by posterior instrumentation. The better reduction of kyphotic angle and the lower cement leakage rate in the kyphoplasty group indicate that additional balloon kyphoplasty is safe and effective for acute thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fractures involve the anterior and middle columns with an intact posterior column. Deforming forces are magnified at areas of transition, making the thoracolumbar junction highly susceptible to injury. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 42 consecutive patients who underwent single-level anterior lumbar corpectomy using an obelisc expandable titanium cage and lateral fixation for traumatic lumbar burst fractures. RESULTS: Myelopathy and sensory dysfunction were the most frequent neurologic deficits initially, occurring in 16 (38{\%}) and 15 (36{\%}) patients, respectively, which both decreased to 5 (13{\%}). At follow-up, 26 patients (68{\%}) were able to ambulate independently. No patient had significant cage displacement or needed cage replacement. Subsidence was minimal in 32 of 39 patients (82{\%}). There were no hardware infections or surgical site infections. Options for stabilization include posterior instrumentation and fusion, anterior corpectomy with interbody fusion, and combination procedures. We believe anterior stabilization is superior because the aim is structural restoration of anterior and middle columns. The aim of posterior fixation is to replace the posterior tension band, which is not affected. There are 3 major surgical components to consider. First is anterior versus posterior decompression of the spinal canal. Second is the choice of autograft or titanium graft. Third is whether to stabilize posteriorly or anterolateral. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior corpectomy with an expandable titanium cage and lateral rod fixation is safe and effective with minimal complications. It is a viable alternative to posterior decompression and instrumentation.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the value of intraoperative CT scanning in the treatment of fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods: From January 2008 to January 2015 , 161 patients with thoracolumbar fractures in Department of Orthopedics, Luohe City Central Hospital, were divided into two groups: 79 cases were treatment group which were treated with intraoperative CT scan and decompression mode was determined according to CT scan results during the period from October 2012 to January 2015. 82 patients as the observation group were treated without intraoperative CT scan and direct laminectomy were performed during the period. In the treatment group, it is no further decompression of the spinal canal when the CT showed a reduction of the fracture block into the spinal canal, if the intraoperative CT showed that the fractures still occupied the spinal dura mater according to the three-dimensional CT information, the position and the size of the fracture of the spinal canal were determined, and the unilateral laminectomy was performed corresponding to the position of the lamina and intervertebral ligamentum flavum. The operative time, bleeding volume, neurological function, height of the anterior vertebral compression and Cobb angle were compared between the two groups. Results: In the treatment group, CT scan showed 48 cases (60.8{\%}) entered the spinal canal fracture completely or basically reset.31 cases (39.2{\%}) still occupied the spinal canal compression spinal dura mater. There were significant differences in the operation time and bleeding volume between the two groups. The treatment group was less than the control group. There was no infection, secondary spinal cord injury, loose fixation and other complications. There was no difference in the ASIA classification before and after operation(chi(2)=0.268 vs chi(2)=1.372, P{\textgreater}0.05). The anterior vertebral height and COBB angle of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those before operation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the postoperative height and COBB angle[(40.3+/-11.8) degrees vs(82.1+/-4.2) degrees , (-10.3+/-2.6) degrees vs(6.9+/-3.3) degrees , P{\textless}0.05], but after 2 years the difference was statistically significant between the two groups, to retain the rear ligament complex treatment group was significantly better than the control group. Conclusions: Patients of thoracolumbar vertebral fracture in hyperextension position combined with internal fixation can achieve good correction effect. Orthopedic postoperative CT scan and according to the results of the scan precision treatment can simplify the operation, there was no difference in clinical efficacy compared with total laminectomy, but some patients avoid the spinal canal decompression and part were treated by small fenestration laminectomy decompression, which is conducive to the protection of spinouts ligament complex integrity.},

@article{Acar2017,
abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An experimental biomechanical study. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the behavior of a lamina injury in lumbar burst fractures during reduction maneuvers. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Lumbar burst fractures are frequently accompanied by a lamina fracture. Many researchers concluded that any reduction maneuver will close the fractured lamina edges and possibly crush the entrapped neural elements. This conclusion did not rely on solid biomechanical trials and was based primarily on clinical experience. METHODS: Eighteen fresh-frozen lamb spines were randomly divided into three groups. Using the preinjury and the dropped-mass technique, a burst fracture model was developed. A central laminectomy of 5 mm of the L3 lumbar spine was created to mimic a complete type of lamina fracture. To measure the movement of the fractured laminar edges, two holes were drilled on both sides of the upper and lower regions of the lamina to allow for optic marker placement. A single specific spine movement was applied to each group: traction, flexion, and extension. Gap changes were measured by camera extensometers. RESULTS: After traction, the average values of the upper and lower aspects of the lamina interval showed narrowing of 1.65+/-0.82 mm and 1.97+/-1.14 mm, respectively. No statistical significance was detected between the two aspects. The upper and lower regions of the lamina gap behaved differently during extension. At 10 degrees , 20 degrees , and 30 degrees , the upper part of the lamina interval was widened by an average of 0.016+/-0.024, 0.29+/-0.32, and 1.73+/-1.45 mm, respectively, whereas the lower part was narrowed by an average of 0.023+/-0.012, 0.47+/-0.038, and 1.94+/-1.46 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neural element crushing may take place, particularly at the lower aspect of the fractured lamina gap during extension and throughout the whole lamina gap during traction. The lamina gap widens during flexion. Reduction maneuvers should be attempted after exploring the fractured lamina to prevent further neurological compromise.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate the diaphragm and intercostal muscle activity after unilateral mid-cervical spinal cord contusion in rats. Electromyogram (EMG) activity of the bilateral diaphragm and T2 intercostal muscle was measured in anesthetized and spontaneously breathing rats. Unilateral mid-cervical contusion caused an immediate reduction in inspiratory bursting in the bilateral diaphragm and intercostal muscles. From 3 days to 8 weeks post-contusion, contused animals displayed significantly lower tidal volume than uninjured animals, regardless of the time point after injury. The burst amplitude of the contralateral diaphragm EMG was augmented in contused animals at 3 days post-injury. When the data were normalized by the maximal response during hypoxic-hypercapnic challenge (12-13{\%} O2, 3-4{\%} CO2), the ipsilateral diaphragm EMG of contused animals was greater than that of uninjured animals at 3 days and 2 weeks post-injury. Moreover, hypoxia-hypercapnia-induced increases in ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity were blunted in contused animals at 2 weeks post-injury, but recovered at 8 weeks post-injury. Bilateral diaphragm EMG activity in contused animals was comparable to uninjured animals at 8 weeks post-injury. Notably, intercostal muscle activity was not substantially changed by mid-cervical spinal cord contusion from 3 days to 8 weeks post-contusion. These results suggest that mid-cervical spinal contusion induces a compensatory increase in contralateral diaphragmatic activity and greater utilization of a percentage of maximal inspiratory activity in the ipsilateral diaphragm. The maintenance of intercostal muscle activity may enable the animal to sustain essential breathing capacity after cervical spinal cord injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The basivertebral foramen (BF), located in the middle posterior wall of the vertebral body, may induce local weakness and contribute to the formation of a retropulsed bone fragment (RBF) in thoracolumbar burst fracture (TLBF). We hypothesize that the mechanism of TLBF is related to the BF. PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify the relationship between RBFs and the BF in TLBFs, and to explain the results using biomechanical experiments and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive research involving clinical radiology, micro-CT, and biomechanical experiments on cadaveric spines was carried out. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 162 consecutive patients diagnosed with TLBF with RBFs, drawn from 256 patients who had reported accidents or injuries to their thoracolumbar spine, comprised the patient sample. OUTCOME MEASURES: Dimensions and location of the RBFs in relation to the BF were the outcome measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography reconstruction imaging was used to measure the dimensions and location of RBFs in 162 patients (length, height, width of RBF and vertebral body). Furthermore, micro-CT scans were obtained of 10 cadaveric spines. Each vertebral body was divided into three layers (superior, middle, and inferior), and each layer was divided further into nine regions (R1-R9). Microarchitecture parameters were calculated from micro-CT scans, including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), connectivity (Conn.D), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and bone mineral density (BMD). Differences were analyzed between regions and layers. Burst fractures were simulated on cadaveric spines to explore the fracture line location and test the relationship between RBFs and BF. RESULTS: Retropulsed bone fragment width was usually one-third of the width of the vertebral body, whereas RBF length and height were approximately half of the corresponding vertebral body dimensions. Measures of trabecular bone quality were generally lowest in those central and superior regions of the vertebral body which are adjacent to the BF and which are most affected by burst fracture. In simulated TLBFs, the fracture line went across the vertex or upper surface of the BF. CONCLUSIONS: The most vulnerable regions in the vertebral body lie within or just superior to the BF. The central MR2 region in particular is at risk of fracture and RBF formation.},

abstract = {Numerous classification systems for subaxial and thoracolumbar spine injuries were proposed in the past with the attempt to facilitate communication between physicians. The AO-Magerl, thoracolumbar system, and Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification systems are all well known, but did not achieve universal international adoption. A group of international experienced spine trauma surgeons were brought together by AOSpine with the goal to develop a comprehensive yet simple classification system for spinal trauma. This article is a synopsis of the proposed subaxial and thoracolumbar classification systems. In several studies, this classification system was developed using an iterative consensus process among the clinical experts in sufficient number and quality of DICOM images of real cases searching for meaningful and reproducible patterns. Both systems are based on 3 injury morphology types: compression injuries (A), tension band injuries (B), and translational injuries (C) with a total of 9 subgroups. In the subaxial cervical spine 4 additional subtypes for facet injuries exist. Patient-specific modifiers and neurologic status were also included to aid surgeons in therapeutic decision making. The proposed classification systems for subaxial and thoracolumbar injuries showed substantial intraobserver and interobserver reliability (kappa = 0.64-0.85) for grading fracture type. Grading for the subtypes varied considerably due to the low frequency of certain injury subtypes among other reasons. In summary, the AOSpine thoracolumbar and subaxial cervical spine injury systems show substantial reliability, thus being valuable tools for clinical and research purposes.},

abstract = {Although less common than other musculoskeletal injuries, spinal trauma may lead  to significantly more disability and costs. During the last 2 decades there was substantial improvement in our understanding of the basic patterns of spinal fractures leading to more reliable classification and injury severity assessment systems but also rapid developments in surgical techniques. Despite these advancements, there remain unresolved issues concerning the management of these injuries. At this moment there is persistent controversy within the spinal trauma community, which can be grouped under 6 headings. First of all there is still no unanimity on the role and timing of medical and surgical interventions for patients with associated neurologic injury. The same is also true for type and timing of surgical intervention in multiply injured patients. In some common injury types like odontoid fractures and burst type (A3-A4) fractures in thoracolumbar spine, there is wide variation in practice between operative versus nonoperative management without clear reasons. Also, the role of different surgical approaches and techniques in certain injury types are not clarified yet. Methods of nonoperative management and care of elderly patients with concurrent complex disorders are also areas where there is no consensus. In this overview article the main reasons for these controversies are reviewed and the possible ways for resolutions are discussed.},

Especially, the treatment strategy for incomplete and complete TL burst fractures (A3 and A4, AOSpine classification) in neurologically intact patients remains controversial. The aim of this work was to collate the clinical evidence on the respective treatment modalities. METHODS: Searches were performed in PubMed and the Web of Science. Clinical and radiological outcome data were collected. For studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment, the standardized mean differences (SMD) for disability and pain were calculated and methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. RESULTS: From 1929 initial matches, 12 were eligible. Four of these compared surgical with conservative treatment. A comparative analysis of radiological results was not possible due to a lack of uniform reporting. Differences in clinical outcomes at follow-up were small, both between studies and between treatment groups. The SMD was 0.00 (95{\%} CI -0.072, 0.72) for disability and -0.05 (95{\%} CI -0.91, 0.81) for pain. Methodological quality was high in most studies and no evidence of publication bias was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find differences in disability or pain outcomes between operative and nonoperative treatment of A3 and A4 TL fractures in neurologically intact patients. Notwithstanding, the available scores have been developed and validated for degenerative diseases; thus, their suitability in trauma may be questionable. Specific and uniform outcome parameters need to be defined and enforced for the evaluation of TL trauma.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: Short posterior stabilization with vertebroplasty is one treatment option for thoracolumbar burst fractures (AO A3). Whether it avoids progression in segmental kyphosis, especially after implant removal, is unclear. In a retrospective case-control study, its stability and the effect on intervertebral discs with and without implant removal was studied. METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients were treated with bisegmental short posterior instrumentation and additional vertebroplasty of the fractured vertebra. Twenty-nine patients (male/female 17/12; age: 41.7 +/- 15.4 years) underwent implant removal. Changes of segmental kyphosis and disc heights between both groups (with and without implant removal) were compared on lateral X-rays preoperative, postoperative, after 1 year and after implant removal. Risk factors for loss of reduction were analyzed. RESULTS: Kyphosis increased up to 12 months after implant removal. The loss of bisegmental correction was 6.0 +/- 4.2 (range 0 degrees to 16 degrees ) 12 months after implant removal. Risk factors for loss of reduction are younger patient age, fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (Th12), and degree of traumatic kyphosis. Intervertebral discs traversed by the stabilization lose height and don't recover within 1 year after implant removal. Without implant removal, disc height of the lower adjacent level is reduced after 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Short posterior stabilization in combination with vertebroplasty is a treatment alternative for thoracic and lumbar AO A3 fractures. After implant removal kyphosis increases, predominantly in the segment above the augmented vertebra. Risk factors for loss of reduction include younger age, fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T12), and higher fracture kyphosis.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective survey-based study. OBJECTIVES: The AO Spine thoracolumbar injury classification has been shown to have good reproducibility among clinicians. However, the influence of spine surgeons' clinical experience on fracture classification, stability assessment, and decision on management based on this classification has not been studied. Furthermore, the usefulness of varying imaging modalities including radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the decision process was also studied. METHODS: Forty-one spine surgeons from different regions, acquainted with the AOSpine classification system, were provided with 30 thoracolumbar fractures in a 3-step assessment: first radiographs, followed by CT and MRI. Surgeons classified the fracture, evaluated stability, chose management, and identified reasons for any changes. The surgeons were divided into 2 groups based on years of clinical experience as {\textless}10 years (n = 12) and {\textgreater}10 years (n = 29). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in correctly classifying A1, B2, and C type fractures. Surgeons with less experience had more correct diagnosis in classifying A3 (47.2{\%} vs 38.5{\%} in step 1, 73.6{\%} vs 60.3{\%} in step 2 and 77.8{\%} vs 65.5{\%} in step 3), A4 (16.7{\%} vs 24.1{\%} in step 1, 72.9{\%} vs 57.8{\%} in step 2 and 70.8{\%} vs 56.0{\%} in step3) and B1 injuries (31.9{\%} vs 20.7{\%} in step 1, 41.7{\%} vs 36.8{\%} in step 2 and 38.9{\%} vs 33.9{\%} in step 3). In the assessment of fracture stability and decision on treatment, the less and more experienced surgeons performed equally. The selection of a particular treatment plan varied in all subtypes except in A1 and C type injuries. CONCLUSION: Surgeons' experience did not significantly affect overall fracture classification, evaluating stability and planning the treatment. Surgeons with less experience had a higher percentage of correct classification in A3 and A4 injuries. Despite variations between them in classification, the assessment of overall stability and management decisions were similar between the 2 groups.},

A total of 10 patients with lumbar disc herniation accompanied by nerve root pain (observation group) and 10 patients with lumbar burst fractures (control group) were selected. The nucleus pulposus tissues of the lesion were obtained during operation for cell culture. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the expression of microRNA-21. The ELISA method was used to detect the levels of IL-6, and type II collagen (Col II). Aggrecan and western blotting was used to detect autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II/-I. As a result, the levels of microRNA-21 and IL-6 in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, but the levels of Col II and aggrecan were significantly lower than those in the control group. The differences were statistically significant (P{\textless}0.05). The levels of ATG7 and LC3-II/-I in the observation group were significantly decreased (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, the expression of microRNA-21 is abnormally high in the nerve root pain of the lumbar intervertebral disc, which can increase the IL-6 inflammatory response and reduce the capacity of cell autophagy.},

We found no differences in the levels of IL-6, Col II, aggrecan, STAT3, MMP-3, and ADAMTS before and after treatment in the control group. However, the levels of miR-146a, IL-6, STAT3, MMP-3, and ADAMTS were significantly elevated, whereas Col II and aggrecan levels were lower in the experimental group before treatment. The levels of IL-6, STAT3, MMP-3, and ADAMTS were elevated after treatment with miR-146a mimic when compared with the miR-146a empty vector in the experimental group, and Col II and aggrecan levels were decreased. However, the cells treated with miR-146a inhibitor had the opposite result. Thus, the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway can be mediated by a high expression of miR-146a to regulate the occurrence of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Burst fractures not associated with any neurological deficits are frequent but not therapeutic agreement on their management is available to date. This case-control study was conducted to try to help guide therapeutic decision in the treatment of such fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study includes consecutive retrospective evaluation of 25 case-patients treated by posterior short-segment fixation associated with kyphoplasty (SFK) in the treatment of A3 thoracolumbar unstable fractures, as compared to a control-group composed of 82 patients treated by long-segment (LF) pedicle screws. RESULTS: SFK patients bled significantly less than the LF patients (p=0.04). Assessment of deformation progression, vertebral height restoration and reduction of the regional kyphotic angle in the SFK and LF groups revealed no statistically significant superiority of one approach on another. In contrast, the height of endplates was significantly increased in the SFK group (p=0.006). The patients' pain levels were significantly improved in the SFK group (p=0.002). However, patients from the SFK group stood earlier postoperatively (1.7 vs 3.7days, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: We believe that SFK in vertebral fractures is as efficient as LF for bone consolidation and spine stabilization. In addition, SFK patients may use fewer analgesics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, its advantages, and limitations in posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures assisted only by lateral fluoroscopic imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre- and postoperative computerized tomographic (CT) scans of 117 patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures, who underwent posterior instrumentation with pedicle screw fixation, were prospectively analyzed. Accuracy of screw placement, reconstruction of the vertebral height, and correction of the kyphotic angle were studied. Position of the pedicle screws were determined, and cortical breach was graded on the postoperative axial CT scans. Percentage of vertebral height reconstruction and kyphotic angle correction were calculated from the postoperative midsagittal CT scans. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight pedicle screws in 234 motion segments were included in this study. 427 screws were centrally placed with an accuracy rate of 91.24{\%}. Out of the 41 (8.76{\%}) screws that breached the pedicle wall, 32 (6.84{\%}) screws had violated the medial wall, while 9 (1.92{\%}) screws breached the lateral wall. There were no "air-ball" screws. No screw penetrated the anterior wall. Postoperatively, none of the patients deteriorated neurologically, and no screw required revision. Postoperatively, there was significant restoration of vertebral height and correction of kyphosis (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pedicle fixation performed on a Relton-Hall frame is relatively simple and, when performed carefully using only lateral fluoroscopic imaging, has a lower potential for complications due to cortical breach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a common complication of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stays. The role of cytokines and other mediators is unknown in AKI induced by an ACS (ACS-AKI), leading to several unanswered questions. The worsening of renal function is usually seen as a dichotomous phenomenon instead of a dynamic change, so evaluating changes of the renal function in time may provide valuable information in the ACS-AKI setting. The aim of this study was to explore inflammatory factors associated to de novo kidney injury induced by de novo cardiac injury secondary to ACS. METHODS: One hundred four consecutive patients with ACS were initially included on the time of admission to the Coronary Unit of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia in Mexico City, from February to May 2016, before any invasive procedure, imaging study, diuretic or anti-platelet therapy. White blood count, hemoglobin, NT-ProBNP, troponin I, C-reactive protein, albumin, glucose, Na(+), K(+), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, creatinine (Cr), endothelin-1 (ET-1), leukotriene-B4, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, resolvin-D1 (RvD1), lipoxin-A4 (LXA4), interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, and -10 were measured. We finally enrolled 78 patients, and subsequently we identified 15 patients with ACS-AKI. Correlations were obtained by a Spearman rank test. Low-rank regression, splines regressions, and also protein-protein/chemical interactions and pathways analyses networks were performed. RESULTS: Positive correlations of DeltaCr were found with BUN, admission Cr, GRACE score, IL-1beta, IL-6, NT-ProBNP and age, and negative correlations with systolic blood pressure, mean-BP, diastolic-BP and LxA4. In the regression analyses IL-10 and RvD1 had positive non-linear associations with DeltaCr. ET-1 had also a positive association. Significant non-linear associations were seen with NT-proBNP, admission Cr, BUN, Na(+), K(+), WBC, age, body mass index, GRACE, SBP, mean-BP and Hb. CONCLUSION: Inflammation and its components play an important role in the worsening of renal function in ACS. IL-10, ET-1, IL-1beta, TnI, RvD1 and LxA4 represent mediators that might be associated with ACS-AKI. IL-6, ET-1, NT-ProBNP might represent crossroads for several physiopathological pathways involved in "de novo cardiac injury leading to de novo kidney injury".},

This is a series of adult patients presented with paraplegia from isolated thoracolumbar fracture and underwent surgical intervention from August 2009 to August 2015. Patients with preexisting disability from previous neurologic condition, patients with associated severe head injury or major medical comorbidities or life-threatening injuries were excluded. Neurological status was assessed on admission using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS). The walking ability was assessed 12 months after surgery using the modified Benzel scale. This study included 53 patients with a mean age of 39.4 years (ranging from 18 years to 58 years). Patients presented with AIS grade A are 6, 18 patients with AIS grade B, and 29 patients with AIS grade C. All the patients with L1 fracture and 70.96{\%} of the patients with T12 fracture regained the ability to walk, but unfortunately all the patients with T10 and T11 fractures didn't regain the walking ability 12 months after surgery. The severity of spinal cord injury and hence the walking recovery were related to the spinal level of fracture. A prospectively controlled study with more patients is needed to reevaluate the walking recovery in paraplegic patients with T10 and T11 fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In the posterior instrumented fusion surgery for thoracolumbar (T-L) burst fracture, early postoperative re-collapse of well-reduced vertebral body fracture could induce critical complications such as correction loss, posttraumatic kyphosis, and metal failure, often leading to revision surgery. Furthermore, re-collapse is quite difficult to predict because of the variety of risk factors, and no widely accepted accurate prediction systems exist. Although load-sharing classification has been known to help to decide the need for additional anterior column support, this radiographic scoring system has several critical limitations. PURPOSE: (1) To evaluate risk factors and predictors for postoperative re-collapse in T-L burst fractures. (2) Through the decision-making model, we aimed to predict re-collapse and prevent unnecessary additional anterior spinal surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Two-hundred and eight (104 men and 104 women) consecutive patients with T-L burst fracture who underwent posterior instrumented fusion were reviewed retrospectively. Burst fractures caused by high-energy trauma (fall from a height and motor vehicle accident) with a minimum 1-year follow-up were included. The average age at the time of surgery was 45.9 years (range, 15-79). With respect to the involved spinal level, 95 cases (45.6{\%}) involved L1, 51 involved T12, 54 involved L2, and 8 involved T11. Mean fixation segments were 3.5 (range, 2-5). Pedicle screw instrumentation including fractured vertebra had been performed in 129 patients (62.3{\%}). OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data using self-report measures (visual analog scale score), radiographic measurements (plain radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance image), and functional measures using the Oswestry Disability Index were evaluated. METHODS: Body height loss of fractured vertebra, body wedge angle, and Cobb angle were measured in serial plain radiographs. We assigned patients to the re-collapse group if their body height loss progressed greater than 20{\%} at any follow-up time compared with immediate postoperative body height loss; we assigned the remaining patients to the well-maintained group. The chi-square test and t test of SPSS were used for comparison of differences between two groups and multiple logistic regression analysis for risk factor evaluation. Through the decision tree analysis of statistical package R, a decision-making model was composed, and a cutoff value of revealed risk factors and re-collapse rate of each subgroup were identified. The present study wassupported by the University College of Medicine Research Fund (university to which authors belong). There was no external funding source for this study. The authors have no conflict of interest to declare. RESULTS: Re-collapse occurred in 31 of 208 patients (14.9{\%}). In this group, age, the proportion of male gender, preoperative height loss, and preoperative wedge angle were significantly greater than the well-maintained group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified two independent risk factors: age (adjusted odds ratio 1.084, p=.002) and body height loss (adjusted odds ratio 1.065, p=.003). According to the decision-making tree, age ({\textgreater}43 years) was the most discriminating variable, andpreoperative body height loss ({\textgreater}54{\%}) was the second. In this model, the re-collapse rate was zero in ages less than 43 years, and among those remaining, nearly 80{\%} patients with greater than 54{\%} of body height loss belonged to the re-collapse group. CONCLUSIONS: The independent predictors of re-collapse after posterior instrumented fusion for T-L burst fracture were the age at operation ({\textgreater}43 years old) and preoperative body height loss ({\textgreater}54{\%}). Careful assessment using our decision-making model could help to predict re-collapse and prevent unnecessary additional spinal surgery for anterior column support, especially in young patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a posterior-only approach for L5  corpectomy, with lumbopelvic fixation for treatment of secondaries, infections, or burst fractures. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2013, 17 patients with L5 pathology had corpectomy through a posterior-only approach, with reconstruction of the anterior column using titanium cages filled with bone graft. The indication for surgery was presence of secondaries in nine patients, spondylitis and spondylodiscitis in five patients and burst fractures due to high energy trauma in three patients. All patients underwent detailed neurological examination as well as plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging studies. RESULTS: This study included 17 patients (8 males and 9 females) with a mean age of 48.3 years. The mean operative time was 186.1 minutes with mean blood loss of 744 ml. No intra-operative or immediate post-operative complications were encountered. Three patients died during follow-up due to advanced malignancy. The remaining 14 patients were followed-up for a mean of 24.9 months. One patient had cut through of L3 screws two years after surgery requiring metal removal. One patient had asymptomatic broken screw, with no need for further intervention. CONCLUSIONS: L5 corpectomy is a challenging procedure indicated for treatment of various cases of metastasis, infections, or comminuted fractures. The posterior approach is safe, efficient, and allows both rigid posterior stabilization and anterior reconstruction after L5 corpectomy without the need for an anterior approach and its possible related morbidity.},

This information will be important in evaluating the amount of canal compromise that can be tolerated before risking neurological injury secondary to cord compression. To date, there is no published study that has evaluated pressure response to graded canal compromise in the thoracic and lumbar spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative biomechanical investigation using an in vitro burst fracture model of graded spinal canal compromise was performed. Four porcine spines, sectioned into four thoracics and four lumbar segments, were harvested from 30 kg pigs. Graded spinal canal compromise (0.75 mm/30 s) was achieved using a modified 12.7 mm dynamic hip screw. The real-time ventral epidural pressure was measured at each 0.75 mm of canal compromise. RESULTS: A significant increase in spinal cord pressure was recorded during graded spinal cord compression (P {\textless} 0.0001), and there were no statistical differences between the increase in pressure measured in the thoracic and lumbar spinal segments (P = 0.83). The pressure to degree of canal compromise curve exhibited an initial rapid rise in pressure followed by incrementally smaller increases in pressure as canal compromise increased. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord pressure increased with any degree of canal compromise, the most important rise occurring with initial compression. Future studies will evaluate the usefulness of laminectomy in vivo to completely restore ventral epidural pressure in the thoracic and lumbar spine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate the role of vertebral augmentation in kyphosis reduction, vertebral fracture union, and correction loss after surgical management of thoracolumbar burst fracture. DESIGN: Retrospective chart and radiographic review. SETTING: Level 1 trauma center. METHODS: The analysis included patients treated between April 2007 and June 2015, who received pedicle-screw-rod distraction and reduction within two days following acute traumatic thoracolumbar burst fracture with a load sharing score {\textgreater}6. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for data regarding operative details, imaging and laboratory findings, neurological function, and functional outcomes. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sagittal index, pain score, loss of correction, and implant failure rate. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled in this study (mean age, 37.2+/-13years; age range, 17-62 years; female/male ratio: 10/9). Of the five patients who received only reduction (no augmentation), one underwent revision surgery because of implant failure and pedicle screw backing out. Compared to patients who received only reduction, those who received both reduction and augmentation showed better sagittal alignment after the operation, with better sagittal index immediately postoperatively and during the follow-up (p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular vertebral augmentation with calcium sulfate/phosphate-based bone cement may reinforce thoracolumbar burst fracture stability, partially restore vertebral body height, and reduce pedicle screw bending and movement, thereby preventing early implant failure and late loss of correction, especially in patients with excellent fracture reduction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level III, retrospective chart review.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Surgical approach development in an animal model, and a prospective study comparing clinical outcomes between novel and conventional approaches in thoracolumbar burst fracture fixation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a less-invasive retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine in a sheep model and to compare the clinical outcomes of anterior reconstruction in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures using novel and conventional approaches. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The anterior retroperitoneal lumbar approach is well established for anterior lumbar surgical procedures in both humans and animal models. However, potential concerns include the increased risk of complications such as soft-tissue trauma, and extended periods of rehabilitation postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A less-invasive retroperitoneal approach was designed in a sheep model with minimal soft-tissue dissection to keep the abdominal and paravertebral muscles intact. Eight sheep underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion using this approach. In the clinical study, 48 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures underwent anterior decompression and reconstruction. The less-invasive approach and conventional approach were applied in 12 and 36 cases, respectively. The clinical outcomes during the minimum 12-month follow-up of the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS: With the less-invasive approach, anterior lumbar interbody fusion was accomplished in all sheep, and no surgical complications were observed. In the clinical study, operation time, blood loss, and duration of hospitalization were comparable between 2 groups. Using the less-invasive approach decreased the length of incision, 3-day postoperative visual analogue scale score, postoperative independent standing, and narcotic-dependent duration. No surgical complications were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results and early experience suggests that the less-invasive retroperitoneal approach is safe and effective for anterior lumbar surgery. Compared with the conventional approach, significantly better postoperative rehabilitation and abdominal muscle preservation were seen with this novel approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional one-above and one-below four-screw posterior short-segment instrumentation is used for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, this method has a high rate of implant failure and early loss of reduction. The purpose of this study was to use finite element (FE) analysis to determine the effect of treating thoracolumbar burst fractures by short-segment pedicle screw fixation using a combination of two additional pedicle screws and vertebroplasty at the level of the fracture. METHODS: An intact T11-L1 spine FE model was created from the computed tomography images of a male subject. Four fixation models with posterior fusion devices (pedicle screws, rods, cross-link) were established to simulate an unstable thoracolumbar fracture with different fusion surgeries: short-segment fixation with: 1) a link (S-L); 2) intermediate bilateral screws (S-I); 3) a link and calcium sulfate cement (S-L-C); 4) intermediate bilateral screws and calcium sulfate cement (S-I-C). Different loading conditions (flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation) were applied on the models and analyzed with a FE package. The range of motion (ROM), and the maximum value and distribution of the implant stress, and the stress in the facet joint, were compared between the intact and fixation models. RESULTS: The ROM in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending was the smallest in the S-I-C model, followed by the S-I, S-L-C, and S-L models. Maximum von Mises stress values were larger under lateral bending and axial rotation loadings than under flexion and extension loading. High stress was concentrated at the crosslink and rod junctions. Maximal von Mises stress on the superior vertebral body for all loading conditions was larger than that on the inferior vertebral body. The maximal von Mises stress of the pedicle screws during all states of motion were 265.3 MPa in S-L fixation, 192.9 MPa in S-I fixation, 258.4 MPa in S-L-C fixation, and 162.3 MPa in S-I-C fixation. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment fixation with two intermediate pedicle screws together with calcium sulfate cement at the fractured vertebrae may provide a stiffer construct and less von Mises stress of the pedicle screws and rods as compared to other types of short-segment fixation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Spasticity is a common disorder in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this study was to investigate whether intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a safe, non-invasive and well-tolerated protocol of excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), is effective in modulating spasticity in SCI patients. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, crossover, sham-controlled study, ten subjects with incomplete cervical or thoracic SCI received 10 days of daily sessions of real or sham iTBS. The H/M amplitude ratio of the Soleus H reflex, the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at rest and during background contraction, as well as Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Spinal Cord Injury Assessment Tool for Spasticity (SCAT) were compared before and after the stimulation protocols. RESULTS: Patients receiving real iTBS showed significant increased resting and active MEPs amplitude and a significant reduction of the H/M amplitude ratio. In these patients also the MAS and SCAT scores were significantly reduced after treatment. These changes persisted up to 1 week after the end of the iTBS treatment, and were not observed under the sham-TBS condition. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that iTBS may be a promising therapeutic tool for the spasticity in SCI patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Burst fractures of the spine account for 14{\%} of all spinal injuries and more than 50{\%} of all thoracolumbar trauma. However, there is ambiguity while choosing the right treatment plan. Short Segment Pedicle screw Fixation (SSPF) has become an increasingly popular method of treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, providing the advantage of incorporating fewer motion segments in the fixation. Various biomechanical studies showed that the use of pedicle screws could achieve stable construct within short-segment fixation. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of SSPF using longest possible screws in both pedicles of fractured vertebra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 25 single burst thoracolumbar fracture patients, operated between May 2009 to 2015 in a tertiary care trauma center, was conducted. Preoperative and post-operative plain radiographs were evaluated for kyphotic angulations using the traditional Cobb method. Anterior Vertebral Height (AVH), Posteriors Vertebral Height (PVH) were measured preoperatively and immediate postoperatively. Average percentage loss of AVH and mid-sagittal height were calculated on preoperative and postoperative X-rays on follow up. RESULTS: Fourteen men and 11 women with an average age of 42.92 years comprised the study population. Mean age at the time of operation was 34.5+/-14.2 years. Mean operation time was 168+/-72 (minutes). Average hospitalization time was 9+/-7 (days). Mean blood loss was 515+/-485 (ml). There were two cases of postoperative infection and implant failure each. A mean of 15.2 degrees of kyphosis correction was attained from pre-operation to post-operation (p{\textless}0.0001). Although, there was a 15 degrees average improvement of kyphosis post-fixation, loss of correction over time was nearly 8 degrees , resulting in a 7 degrees mean correction of kyphosis. A mean loss of AVH on postoperative radiograph was 6.12{\%} and maintained 12.4{\%} at the time of review (p{\textless}0.001). Similarly, there was 32.8{\%} mid-sagittal height loss at time of injury, which was improved to only 12.6{\%} as compare to initial height loss (p{\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSION: In this study, we propose SSPF using longest possible screws in both pedicle of fractured vertebra. Bi-pedicular fixation gives significant radiological corrections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study attempts to prove a cause and effect relationship between  spine immobilization following posterior fixation for unstable burst fractures and degeneration observed following hardware removal. METHODS: We enrolled 57 patients (259 intervertebral discs [IVDs]) who underwent only posterior instrumentation without fusion for thoracolumbar and lumbar unstable burst fractures. We arbitrarily named the IVD that has an endplate fracture after immobilization using pedicle screws as the fractured endplate and immobilized disc (FEID), the IVD that has no endplate fracture after immobilization using pedicle screws as the nonfractured endplate and immobilized disc (NFEID), and the IVD that has no endplate fracture and no immobilization instrumentation as the normal disc (ND). At 2 years after implant removal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed again for comparison. The extent of disc degeneration was classified using the Pfirrmann classification system. RESULTS: FEIDs were present in 67 levels, NFEIDs in 78 levels, and NDs in 114 levels. According to the Pfirrmann classification, 7.9{\%} of the NDs, 32.1{\%} of the NFEIDs, and 43.3{\%} of the FEIDs were more degenerated at 2 years after implant removal. The FEIDs and NFEIDs were more degenerated than the NDs and the FEIDs were more degenerated than the NFEIDs at statistically significant levels (p {\textless} 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Spine immobilization with transpedicular screws has a significant influence on disc degeneration, and an endplate fracture accelerates the degeneration process.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the functional recovery between early kyphoplasty and conservative care in paratroopers with stable thoracolumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Treatment of traumatic stable thoracolumbar fractures in young individuals is still a debate. Conservative management and kyphoplasty are options of therapy. But enough data are not available for supporting each. METHODS: We included 70 paratroopers with stable thoracolumbar fractures (A1 and A2 classification according to AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system) presenting {\textless}60 days after trauma and hyperintensity in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Old fractures and those requiring fixation were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 study groups to undergo percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (n=34) or conservative care (n=36) by applying orthosis for 2 months. Patients were followed for 12 months and were evaluated clinically using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between 2 study groups. The VAS score and ODI decreased significantly in both study groups after 12 months of treatment. The VAS score was significantly lower in kyphoplasty group after the intervention (P{\textless}0.001), 1 month (P{\textless}0.001), 3 months (P{\textless}0.001), 6 months (P{\textless}0.001), and 12 months (P{\textless}0.001) after the intervention. In addition, the ODI was significantly lower after the intervention (P{\textless}0.001), 1 month (P{\textless}0.001), 3 months (P{\textless}0.001), 6 months (P{\textless}0.001), and 12 months (P{\textless}0.001) after the intervention. Kyphoplasty was associated with shorter duration of returning to parachuting (P{\textless}0.001) and shorter duration of absence from work (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early kyphoplasty in stable thoracolumbar fractures after parachute jumping is associated with less pain, better functional recovery, less days of absence from work, and shorter duration of returning to parachuting.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of acute ({\textless}24 hours) and hyperacute ({\textless}8 hours) treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures to maintain or improve spinal injury scores. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, treatment of spinal burst fractures within 24 hours from injury was considered an "acute" treatment timeframe. Patient polytrauma triage, multiple surgical specialty, and hospital resource coordination affect time to treatment. The mini-open lateral approach for thoracolumbar corpectomy obviates the need for an approach surgeon, which may allow for early surgical intervention. METHODS: Sixteen patients treated within 24 hours with a mini-open lateral corpectomy for traumatic spinal pathology were reviewed for preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data. Neurologic status was assessed using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores. Fractures occurred primarily from L1 to L3. Wide-footprint expandable titanium devices were used in 75{\%} of patients. All patients received supplemental fixation. RESULTS: Average time from injury to admission to the hospital (emergency room [ER]) was 1.8 hours, with an average time from the ER to operating room (OR) of 8.2 hours and an average OR time of 2.7 hours. Eight patients required {\textless}/=8 hours from injury event to surgical initiation, whereas seven patients required between 8 and 24 hours for surgery initiation (one patient with incomplete surgical timing record). Blood loss averaged 646 mL without intraoperative complication. One perioperative complication occurred and one patient developed an asymptomatic inferior vertebral body fracture. Length of hospital stay averaged 6 days. At last follow-up, nearly all patients experienced full or near-complete neurologic recovery with at least one ASIA grade improvement seen in 73{\%} and 20{\%} of patients improving two grades or more. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mini-open lateral approaches allow immediate decompression through hyperacute ({\textless}8 hours) treatment of spinal burst fractures in eligible patients. Additionally, low perioperative and postoperative morbidity allows for hastened recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To predict spinal canal compromise, the assessment of plain radiography  with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid the detection of vertebral body collapse and prevent the development of neurological deficits. METHODS: Patients who suffered osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) between January 2012 and December 2014 underwent consecutive radiological assessments, including measurements of anterior height loss (AHL), posterior height loss (PHL), and the kyphotic angle (KA). The fracture morphology was classified by AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system. MRI was performed at the initial assessment and the extent of canal encroachment (CE) was calculated in all patients. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) or MRI was performed in patients exhibiting significant height loss in follow-up radiography. The fracture patterns in T1- and T2-weighted MRI were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients visited our institute for treatment of OVFs and 97 were enrolled; 15 were male and 82 were female. The mean age at initial visit was 70.3+/-14.6years. The initial spinal CE was correlated with the initial PHL and the initial AHL. The follow-up CE was correlated with age, the initial PHL, and the difference between the initial and last PHL (DeltaPHL(initial-last)). OVFs with both endplate fractures have a greater tendency of posterior wall collapse than those with single endplate fracture. On initial T1-weighted sagittal MRI, a diffuse low signal change pattern of the fractured vertebra was correlated with PHL. Delayed neurological deficits developed in four patients. These patients underwent surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with simple compression fractures, attention should be paid to the posterior vertebral body and both endplates as well as the T1-weighted MRI findings to allow early detection of spinal canal compromise, which can have devastating consequences.},

METHODS: A retrospective case series study was conducted among 21 high-volume surgical centers to identify instances of thoracic duct injury during anterior cervical spine surgery. Staff at each center abstracted data for each identified case into case report forms. All case report forms were collected by the AOSpine North America Clinical Research Network Methodological Core for data processing, cleaning, and analysis. RESULTS: Of a total of 9591 patients reviewed that underwent cervical spine surgery, 2 (0.02{\%}) incurred iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct. Both patients underwent a left-sided anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The interruption of the thoracic duct was addressed intraoperatively in one patient with no residual postoperative effects. The second individual developed a chylous fluid collection approximately 2 months after the operation that required drainage via needle aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: Damage to the thoracic duct during cervical spine surgery is a relatively rare occurrence. Rapid identification of the disruption of this lymphatic vessel is critical to minimize deleterious effects of this complication.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A multicenter, prospective, randomized equivalence trial comparing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) to no orthosis (NO) in the treatment of acute AO Type A3 thoracolumbar burst fractures was recently conducted and demonstrated that the two treatments following an otherwise similar management protocol are equivalent at 3 months postinjury. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there was a difference in long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes between the patients treated with and those treated without a TLSO. Here, the authors present the 5- to 10-year outcomes (mean follow-up 7.9 +/- 1.1 years) of the patients at a single site from the original multicenter trial. METHODS Between July 2002 and January 2009, a total of 96 subjects were enrolled in the primary trial and randomized to two groups: TLSO or NO. Subjects were enrolled if they had an AO Type A3 burst fracture between T-10 and L-3 within the previous 72 hours, kyphotic deformity {\textless} 35 degrees , no neurological deficit, and an age of 16-60 years old. The present study represents a subset of those patients: 16 in the TLSO group and 20 in the NO group. The primary outcome measure was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at the last 5- to 10-year follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included kyphosis, satisfaction, the Numeric Rating Scale for back pain, and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental and Physical Component Summary (MCS and PCS) scores. In the original study, outcome measures were administered at admission and 2 and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after injury; in the present extended follow-up study, the outcome measures were administered 5-10 years postinjury. Treatment comparison between patients in the TLSO group and those in the NO group was performed at the latest available follow-up, and the time-weighted average treatment effect was determined using a mixed-effects model of longitudinal regression for repeated measures averaged over all time periods. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and were replaced with a set of plausible values derived using a multiple imputation procedure. RESULTS The RMDQ score at 5-10 years postinjury was 3.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SE) for the TLSO group and 4.8 +/- 1.5 for the NO group (p = 0.486, 95{\%} CI -2.3 to 4.8). Average kyphosis was 18.3 degrees +/- 2.2 degrees for the TLSO group and 18.6 degrees +/- 3.8 degrees for the NO group (p = 0.934, 95{\%} CI -7.8 to 8.5). No differences were found between the NO and TLSO groups with time-weighted average treatment effects for RMDQ 1.9 (95{\%} CI -1.5 to 5.2), for PCS -2.5 (95{\%} CI -7.9 to 3.0), for MCS -1.2 (95{\%} CI -6.7 to 4.2) and for average pain 0.9 (95{\%} CI -0.5 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS Compared with patients treated with a TLSO, patients treated using early mobilization without orthosis maintain similar pain relief and improvement in function for 5-10 years.},

Thirty-one patients underwent a posterior approach for reduction and stabilization of a thoracolumbar burst fracture, with complete follow-up available on 26. Intraoperative real-time sonography was used for monitoring retropulsed fragments during distraction and fracture impaction. Computed tomography was used to compare preoperative canal compromise and postoperative reduction. Average canal compromise preoperatively was 66.5{\%}, and the average canal compromise postoperatively was 18.7{\%}. Neurologic function was not changed in 16, improved in ten, and worsened in none. Average hospital stay was 21.6 days. No complications were directly attributable to the use of the ultrasound. The authors believe that ultrasonography provides a safe and accurate method of intraoperatively evaluating reduction of burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine from the posterior approach.},

abstract = {Six patients with long-lasting spasticity resistant to different drug therapies including oral baclofen received a bolus injection of lumbar intrathecal baclofen. Electromyographic (EMG) reactions of leg muscles (soleus, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and hamstrings) to standard stimuli and during attempts at voluntary activation were recorded before the drug injection and up to 3 h after the injection. Responses to joint movements, H-reflexes, ankle clonus, and defensive reactions were noticeably suppressed within 30-45 min after the injection and had practically disappeared after 2 h. Ankle clonus was seen only in patients with H-reflexes, and clonus disappeared when the reflex responses to the n. tibialis stimuli were absent. A decrease in clonus EMG burst amplitudes was accompanied by a decrease in the clonus frequency. These observations favor the autooscillation hypothesis of clonus. Baclofen injection led to improvement in selective voluntary activation of leg muscles in patients with residual motor control. These results suggest that execution of voluntary motor commands in the patients suffered from functionally abnormal spinal circuitry rather than from changes in the descending motor commands. Intrathecal baclofen appears to be an effective way of eliminating increased muscle tone and spasms which can allow for voluntary motor function when it is present.},

abstract = {Prostacyclin (PGI2) is an inhibitor of platelet function in vitro. We tested the  hypothesis that PGI2 is formed in biologically active concentrations at the platelet-vascular interface in man and can be pharmacologically modulated to enhance its inhibitory properties. This became feasible when we developed a microquantitative technique that permits the measurement of eicosanoids in successive 40-microliters aliquots of whole blood emerging from a bleeding time wound. In 13 healthy volunteers the rate of production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 421 +/- 90 (mean +/- SEM) fg/microliters per s at 300 +/- 20 s. The hydration product of PGI2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, rose earlier and to a lesser degree, reaching a peak (68 +/- 34 fg/microliters per s) at 168 +/- 23 s. The generation of prostaglandins PGE2 and D2 resembled that of PGI2. Whereas the threshold concentration of PGI2 for an effect on platelets in vitro is approximately 30 fg/microliters, only less than 3 fg/microliters circulates under physiological conditions. By contrast, peak concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha obtained locally after vascular damage averaged 305 fg/microliters. Pharmacological regulation of PG endoperoxide metabolism at the platelet-vascular interface was demonstrated by administration of a TX synthase inhibitor. The rate of production of PGI2, PGE2, and PGD2 increased coincident with inhibition of TXA, as reflected by three indices; the concentration of TXB2 in bleeding time blood and serum, and excretion of the urinary metabolite, 2,3-dinor-TXB2. These studies indicate that PGI2 is formed locally in biologically effective concentrations at the site of vessel injury and provide direct evidence in support of transcellular metabolism of PG endoperoxides in man.},

abstract = {Thoracic spine (T1-T10) fractures can be considered a specific entity owing to the anatomic features of the rib cage and the spinal canal. During a nine year period, the authors treated 105 such fractures. The thoracic spine fractures included 57 (54.2 per cent) compression fractures, 21 (20 per cent) comminuted (burst) fractures, 3 (2.8 per cent) flexion-distraction fractures, and 24 (23 per cent) fracture-dislocations. Five lesions, termed "fracture-dislocations by an oblique shearing force", were characterized by considerable displacement and the absence of neurologic injury. 35.2 per cent of the patients had injuries at multiple levels. The frequency of associated thoracic (26.5 per cent) and scapular injuries (20 per cent) reflected involvement of the entire thoracic cage. The frequency of neurologic impairment (30.4 per cent including 20 per cent complete paraplegia) reflects the particular vulnerability of the dorsal spinal cord. 32 per cent of the patients presented one or more thoracic effusions (hemomediastinum, hemothorax) related to parietal hematoma and/or hematoma at the fracture site. Functional management of 47 patients led to recovery of a painless spine without kyphotic deformity. Conservative treatment was often difficult because of associated parietal lesions; the 10 patients treated in this manner had only moderate reductions that maintained poorly in time, but had no major painful sequellae. A posterior approach was used for 42 patients with unstable or neurotoxic fractures because this permitted a complete decompression down to the posterior wall, when necessary by a "wide laminectomy". The anterior approach was reserved for purely anterior compression (3 cases) or residual compression after an initial posterior procedure (2 cases). Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation (used in 7 cases) was particularly indicated because it offers the advantages of Harrington rods (31 cases) while providing better stabilization. This prevented later loss of reduction and obviated the need for a postoperative brace.},

abstract = {The change from coronal to sagittal plane orientation of the zygapophyseal (facet) joints at the thoracolumbar junction, coupled with differences in lumbar and thoracic spine mobility, may predispose the T10 to L2 segments to injury. To test for an association between the level of injury and variations in orientation of the zygapophyseal joints, CT investigations of 44 spinal injured patients were studied. Of these, 28 sustained burst/compression fractures and 16 demonstrated a rotation injury with disruption to one or both zygapophyseal joints. Injuries were examined to determine whether more congruent "mortice" joints localised the segmental level of trauma. The Chi-square statistic was used: to compare the transitional characteristics of 44 clinical cases with a "normal" patient database (n = 630); to examine differences in transition patterns between the "compression" and "rotation" injury groups; and to compare the incidence of mortice joints between the clinical and normal series. A significant difference between the transition patterns of the clinical and normal series (p less than 0.001) appeared to account for the higher frequency of abrupt transitions in the 44 injury cases. No significant differences distinguished the transition patterns of the two injury groups. A higher incidence of mortice joints was demonstrated in the injury group compared with the normal population (p less than 0.02). These findings suggest that individuals with an abrupt transition have a greater predisposition to injuries at the thoracolumbar junction.},

The injury most frequently occurred with a burst fracture of the first lumbar vertebra. All patients could walk on discharge but 4 required some form of external support. Regular bladder habit was regained in all patients but none had normal bladder sensation. Urinary tract infections were quite uncommon and there was good correlation between the incidence of infections and the degree of bladder control. No patient had developed chronic renal failure or chronic urinary tract infection. Bowel control was similarly preserved but at a somewhat lower level of competence. Eleven of 16 males had been able to undertake intercourse though with variable adequacy. Potency was linked with the degree of preservation of genital sensation. The conclusion is that the prognosis for conus lesions is somewhat better than is widely appreciated.},

All the measurements were made at admission, immediately postoperatively, and at the latest follow-up at least 3 months after removal of the rods, which was done as a routine procedure 6-12 months after the accident. The mean follow-up was 29 months. The posterior height and sagittal width of the vertebral bodies were best restored, whereas the initially well-reduced anterior height and the angle of kyphosis often had returned to values close to those seen on admission. The best anatomic restoration was obtained in rotation-dislocation injuries of the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine, and was poorest in burst fractures of the lumbar spine.},

abstract = {Treatment of thoracolumbar spine burst fracture with a neurologically intact patient is controversial, with advocates of operative and nonoperative approaches. Of 404 patients in a prospective spinal trauma study, 21 had burst fractures, were neurologically intact, and had greater than 1-year followup. This group was analyzed to evaluate treatment with early mobilization using a thoracolumbar total contact orthosis. The average time in a brace was 6 months. Two patients had pulmonary embolus treated successfully with anticoagulants. No patient required subsequent surgery for increasing kyphosis or neurologic deficit. Change in K angle at followup was 4.6 degrees (+/- 5.7) and change in anterior vertebral height was 6.1 degrees (+/- 10). All patients had a satisfactory pain score and most individuals returned to full employment. It is concluded that it is not necessary to routinely treat patients operatively with burst fractures if they fulfill the following criteria: 1) neurologically intact; 2) kyphosis angle less than 35 degrees; 3) other injuries do not preclude the use of a total contact orthosis; and 4) the patient is capable of understanding and cooperating with the treatment regime. These criteria are irrespective of the CT findings of posterior vertebral retropulsion and spinal canal narrowing.},

The follow-up period averaged 32 months (range, 12-50 months). Treatment was as follows: nonoperative (three patients), Harrington rods and fusion (seven patients), and Harrington rods and fusion followed by anterior decompression and fusion (four patients). The initial severity of paralysis did not correlate with the initial fracture roentgenographic pattern or the amount of initial CT canal compromise. Neurologic recovery did not correlate with the treatment method or amount of canal decompression. Subsequent recovery did correlate with the initial fracture pattern. If the patient had a Type I or Type II fracture (both greater than 15 degrees kyphosis), greater than 90{\%} neurologic recovery occurred, regardless of treatment. If the patient had a Type III fracture (less than 15 degrees kyphosis and the maximal canal compromise where bone encircles the canal) less than 50{\%} neurologic recovery occurred. If the patient had a Type IV fracture (less than or equal to 15 degrees kyphosis and the maximal canal compromise at the level of the ligamentum flavum), the neurologic recovery was variable. Prognosis for neurologic recovery can be made based on initial roentgenograms. If greater than 15 degrees kyphosis is present, there is a good prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Stable injuries are compression-wedge-fractures and burst fractures. Severe compression fractures with dorsal ligamentous injuries are regarded being conditional stable. Conservative treatment can be divided into 3 periods: lying period, rising period and stand-walk-sit period. Physiotherapy together with proper nursing is to avoid pulmonary and circulatory complications as well as to support motility of the intestinal tract. After stabilization of the general condition of the patient physiotherapy should furthermore lead to: relaxation of the hypertonic musculature, facilitating and preservation of muscle activities to secure the injured parts of the spine, training and assignment of global, diagonal muscle chains following physiological motions. From 1982-1986 389 patients with fractures of the spine were treated in the Tubingen Accident Hospital (Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik Tubingen). An early functional treatment following Burkle de la Camp was performed in 84{\%}. The follow up examination showed no further displacement in 84{\%}. In 1/3 of the cases a free movement was regarded in the sagittal plane. 2/3 of the cases showed restriction of movement in only one segment. The good functional result is underlined by the subjective impression of the patient themselves: 2/3 were satisfied with the result.},

If surgery is decided upon, this article suggests a plan to accomplish the reduction of the fracture and decompression of the neural elements. The fractures are divided into compression injuries, seat belt injuries, fracture-dislocations, and burst fractures. In each case the goal is to realign and stabilize the spine and allow adequate room for the spinal cord or the cauda equina. A burst fracture requires the most careful planning. Some decompression can be accomplished by distraction alone but impaction of the fragments posteriorly or removal of the fragments anteriorly may be required. The experience at the author's university has demonstrated that by using these techniques, the preoperative neurocanal compromise can be significantly improved over those series using posterior distraction alone. If canal compromise cannot be accomplished posteriorly, then anterior surgery is required.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation was carried out to create burst fractures and to evaluate the mechanisms and degree of reduction of the intracanal fragment with posterior instrumentation techniques in multisegmental human cadaver specimens. Reduction of the spinal fragment through kyphosis correction and distraction was evaluated using CT imaging. With kyphosis correction alone there was no decrease in canal compromise; in some cases there was a slight increase in canal compromise. Distraction, whether applied before or after kyphosis correction was the effective mechanism in reducing the fracture fragment. Kyphosis correction applied after distraction did not reduce the fragment further. Posterior devices that are used to treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine with intracanal fragments should provide some form of distraction.},

Anterior surgery has been performed in 80 cases for burst injuries of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Fifty-seven of these were paraparetic. While there were two cases of nonunion and 11 screw breakages, there were no early or late vascular or neurological complications. Average neurological recovery was 1.6 grades on the Frankel scale.

Forty-two patients meeting specified inclusion criteria were contacted and completed questionnaires. In all cases, nonoperative treatment was the only treatment received. The average time from injury to follow-up was 20.2 years (range, 11 to 55 years). The average age at follow-up was 43 years (range, 28 to 70 years). There were 31 men and 11 women in this series. Seventy-one percent of the injuries were the result of motor vehicle accidents. The most common sites of injury were T12-L2, which accounted for 64{\%} of the injuries. Seventy-eight percent of the patients had no neurologic deficits at the time of injury. At follow-up, the average back pain score was 3.5, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being very severe pain. No patient demonstrated a decrease in their neurologic status at follow-up, and no patient required narcotic medication for pain control. Eighty-eight percent of patients were able to work at their usual level of activity. Follow-up radiographs revealed an average kyphosis angle of 26.4 degrees in flexion and 16.8 degrees in extension. The degree of kyphosis did not correlate with pain or function at follow-up. Based on this review, nonoperative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains as a viable alternative in patients without neurologic deficit and can lead to acceptable long-term results.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that the broad 4.5 mm dynamic compression plate provides  superior stiffness in axial and torsional loading compared to the two anterior rod constructs (Zielke-Slot and Kostuik-Harrington) and the thinner ASIF T-plate in this ex-vivo testing. The Armstrong National Research Council (NRC) plate, designed specifically for anterior spinal instrumentation, has essentially the same mechanical performance characteristics as the broad dynamic compression plate. When placed on the lateral aspect of the vertebral body, these latter two plates lie well away from the anterior vascular structures. Screws are placed slightly off set in the plate, two each in the vertebral bodies immediately above and below the fracture, the screws directed transversely across the vertebral body. The broad DCP plate is easily contoured and implanted, and will allow 1.8 mm of compression to be applied to a strut graft between vertebral bodies. Anterior surgery for the treatment of burst fractures with retropulsed bone provides a means for direct decompression of the spinal canal. With an appropriate implant, additional advantages include instrumentation over a shorter distance (one above and one below the fracture) and no need for further operative procedures to implant or remove posterior implants. Due to their superior stiffness in axial and torsional load, the broad dynamic compression plate and the Armstrong NRC plate appear to fulfill most nearly the ideal attributes of an anterior spinal implant for the treatment of burst fractures of the throacic and lumbar spine.},

Transpedicular osteosynthesis of instable fractures of thoracic or lumbar regions of the spine has been practised by the authors since 1986, with plate fixation of only two vertebral segments. Pathoneurological disorders are handled by laminectomy or hemilaminectomy followed by H-shaped interspine bone grafting. Posterior rim fragments, burst off the spine, are either reduced or removed. Intraoperative perimyelography is possible. Therapeutic exercises are initiated immediately after the operation. After wound healing, the patient is allowed to get out of bed, supported by a plaster corset. Eleven patients have so far undergone the above surgical treatment. Four of them have resumed their original jobs, whereas three patients with paraplegia have been transferred to a rehabilitation centre.},

abstract = {Recent evidence has shown that a variety of prostaglandins and leukotrienes can be produced in brain tissue after injury in animals. It has also been speculated that increases in brain prostaglandins occur in humans following injury. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples have been obtained from children with static lesions (controls) as well as children with acute brain injury and eicosanoids measured by immunologic techniques. Metabolites of prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF1 a) and thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2) were the major eicosanoids found in CSF, and levels of these compounds were increased 3-10 times in acutely injured patients. Prostaglandin E2 was also found in lower amounts, although in one case its level was very high. Prostaglandin D2 was also present, but in low amounts. No leukotrienes were found in CSF samples that were purified by HPLC prior to immunoassay. Elevated levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) were observed in those samples stored frozen, but these metabolites were most probably due to autooxidation of arachidonic acid in CSF. Arachidonic acid concentration in CSF was typically found to be in the range of 10-200 ng/ml, but was found to be 5-10 fold higher in one severely injured patient. Thus, elevated free arachidonic acid and various oxygenated metabolites were observed in CSF following brain injury.},

All unstable injuries were initially treated by reduction and posterior fusion. In 79 of these patients, an anterolateral decompression was undertaken later because of persistent neurological deficit and radiographic demonstration of encroachment on the spinal canal. One patient died of pulmonary embolism; 78 were reviewed after a mean period of four years. Of these 78 patients 18 made a complete neurological recovery while 53 appeared to have benefited from the procedure; 25 remained unchanged. The best results were obtained in burst fractures at thoracolumbar and lumbar levels when a solitary detached fragment of a vertebral body had been displaced into the spinal canal. These results indicate that anterolateral decompression of the spinal canal should be considered, after careful evaluation, for certain injuries of the spine in which there is severe neural involvement.},

All patients in this series had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. This new instrumentation is a posterior intrapedicular system developed by Dick in 1982. It allows stable fixation that is limited only to adjacent spinal segments. The internal fixator permits reduction in all three planes. Independently, it is possible to add distraction or compression to the involved segments. It also is able to reduce effectively the "middle column" which is thought to be accomplished by "ligamentotaxis." In this series there were 16 neurologically intact patients and 14 with partial or complete neurologic injury. There were two minor instrumentation loosenings early in the series. Most patients in this series had a near-anatomic reduction of all three columns in the involved segment. It was also possible to re-establish the normal lordosis of the lumbar spine. The device provided sufficient rigid fixation for rapid postoperative mobilization in a light external orthosis.},

abstract = {Seventeen cadaveric human lumbar motion segments from eight spines were cyclically loaded in vitro under axial compression. Loading frequency and magnitude were chosen to simulate rigorous activity within an in vivo physiological level. The load magnitude was determined as a percentage of the ultimate compressive load, the latter estimated from the bone mineral content (BMC) of lumbar vertebrae determined by dual-photon absorptiometry. Following testing, the degree of macroscopic disc degeneration was assessed and the type of fracture in each specimen was determined from serial sagittal sections. Fractures were found in all but one specimen. Three types of fractures were formed: the node of Schmorl and Junghanns (type I), central endplate fracture (type II), and a crush or burst fracture (type III). The results suggested that type I fractures were predominantly associated with segments with normal discs, type II fractures were found primarily in segments with moderately degenerated discs, and type III fractures were associated with segments that failed on the first cycle. Segment stiffness and fatigue strength (cycles to failure) were correlated with disc degeneration, age, and segment BMC, the latter an in vivo measure of bone density. Fatigue strength also decreased in proportion to a power coefficient with increasing relative stress (cyclic stress range/ultimate stress).},

These abnormalities were also present in 36 of the 46 patients with combined burst injuries.

CT studies showed these abnormalities to be the result of retropulsion of one or more bone fragments from the posterior margin of the vertebral body. Disruptive abnormalities of the posterior vertebral body line are reliable plain-film signs that a burst fracture has occurred and that compromise of the vertebral canal and subarachnoid space is present.},

At follow-up, the shoulders had an average of 126 degrees of active elevation, 29 degrees of active external rotation, 81 degrees of active abduction, and internal rotation to the second lumbar vertebra. The only early complication was failure of fixation in the patient who had been treated with a buttress plate.

Specifically: compression combined with distraction produced the best overall anatomic results, but bilateral compression and bilateral distraction were most effective for reducing flexion--distraction and flexion--axial compression (burst) fractures, respectively; two or more level laminectomies adversely affected reductions; end-plate fractures did not; the best reductions were obtained in flexion--distraction injuries; and the poorest reductions occurred in flexion--axial compression injuries, lumbar fractures, and fractures operated on 6 weeks or more after injury.},

abstract = {A retrospective review of 75 burst fractures of the spine was performed to define the radiographic features found on high-resolution CT, polytomography, and plain radiography and thereby allow full characterization of this uncommon spinal injury. Characteristic components of the injury include: centripetally oriented disruption of the vertebral body, unilateral or bilateral laminar fractures that abut the spinous process, marked anterior wedging, vertically oriented vertebral fracture emanating from the basivertebral foramen, increased interpediculate distance, and significant spinal canal narrowing by characteristic retropulsed fragments. Nearly all bursts occurred from T9 to L5; double bursts were present in less than 10{\%} of cases. The usually present neurologic deficit nearly always corresponded to the level of the burst rather than to the frequently found noncontiguous associated spine fracture. Recent literature suggests that these complex fractures, which were initially thought to represent stable injuries, are often unstable. A subcategorization of burst fractures and their variants is proposed to explain this instability. An approach to the radiographic diagnosis of the spinal burst is proposed, and plain film clues to distinguish the burst fracture from the more common compression fracture are discussed. Representative cases are illustrated.},

abstract = {While new spine-stabilizing devices are beginning to appear as alternative methods of providing operative spine stability, a careful review of those methods used by the Spine Injury Service at Northwestern University was undertaken. The method of stabilization most frequently used was the Harrington distraction rod device. With the coming of the Luque rod "segmental instrumentation" technique, improved spine stability was attained, although the attributes of the Harrington distraction system could not be substituted by the Luque system. A natural spin-off was the combination of the Harrington and the Luque methods of internal fixation. This has been a significant addition to the spine surgeon's surgical armamentarium. Still there are problems of implant stability, for which the Jacobs AO rods were developed, and the need for better correction of the spine's malposition following fracture (Edwards system). Because of the concern for the placement of sublaminar wires beneath the lamina, particularly in the area of the very narrow thoracic neural canal, the "Wisconsin" system of spinous process wires was developed. The discussion in this chapter is limited to the statistical data gathered from the management of 646 fracture-dislocations of the spine, of which 374 were surgically managed. As noted in Table 39-3, there are hazards to the instrumentation of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine. In this surgical group, neurologic deterioration occurred in 2.39{\%}; however, there was evidence of significant "risk-benefit" in surgery, with 15.22{\%} of surgical patients demonstrating neurologic improvement after surgery of at least one Frankel grade. When compared with those patients managed conservatively, 6.57{\%} demonstrated neurologic improvement, whereas only 0.34{\%} demonstrated neurologic deterioration.},

abstract = {The optimal treatment of "burst" fractures is one of the more controversial topics in spinal reconstructive surgery. While it is generally considered a stable fracture, recent trends toward operative treatment of burst injuries have raised questions regarding the necessity of stabilization and decompression. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who presented at the University of Minnesota Hospitals from 1970 to 1980 with closed thoracolumbar spinal fractures. In 354 of 399 patients, records and roentgenograms were adequate for review. Using strict x-ray criteria for classification, 59 patients were found to have burst fractures. One-year follow-up was available on 53 patients. There were 10 thoracic and 43 lumbar fractures. Thirty-one patients had associated injuries. Eleven patients had other spinal fractures. Thirty-eight patients demonstrated neurologic deficits. Twenty-two patients were initially treated nonoperatively, and 31 had early surgery. Operations included laminectomy, posterolateral decompression, posterior spinal fusion usually with Harrington rod instrumentation, and anterior spinal fusion. At follow-up, which averaged more than 3 years, neurologic improvement was found in 68{\%} of the surgical patients who had presented initially with a neurologic deficit. Six patients treated nonoperatively later required surgery. Back pain was more common in the surgical group, disability less common. Radiographic follow-up revealed little increase in deformity in either group. The findings in this study suggest that nonsurgical treatment of patients with burst fractures and normal neurologic function is not likely to result in neurologic deterioration or progressive deformity, but in those with neural deficits, significant neurologic improvement is unlikely, and neurologic deterioration may occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Cross-sectional spinal canal area was measured before and after surgery in 12 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and canal narrowing caused by retropulsed fragments. Patients were classified into Denis type A or type B. Denis type A fractures have comminution of both end-plates of the vertebral body creating multiple smaller fractures; Denis type B fractures have comminution of the superior end-plate only with a single vertical fracture line into the inferior end-plate creating larger fragments. The degree of neurologic impairment was assessed before and after surgery using the Frankel system. There was no correlation between degree of canal narrowing and degree of neurologic impairment. The degree of spinal canal narrowing reflects the final resting position of the vertebral body fragments after trauma; during trauma, greater degrees of canal impingement may have occurred. Also, significant canal narrowing may be present without pinching of the cord or cauda equina. All patients with Denis type A fractures had near-anatomic reduction of fragments out of the spinal canal by surgery; less than half of the patients with Denis type B had good reduction. There was no correlation between reduction of retropulsed fragments and subsequent neurologic improvement. However, this should not preclude surgery as a therapeutic option: Eight of 10 patients with neurologic impairment experienced some improvement in symptoms after surgery; the other two were unchanged.},

This technique has allowed reduction of retropulsed bony elements from the spinal canal, assessment of canal decompression and reestablishment of vertebral body alignment. The approach permits posterior fusion at the same operation. If the postoperative CAT scan continues to show spinal cord embarrassment from anterior bony elements, an anterior approach can be performed for additional decompression and fusion. The posterolateral approach does not necessarily improve neurologic function. However, when compared with posterior instrumentation alone, it does help ensure canal reduction and alignment, which may aid recovery and hasten rehabilitation.},

@article{McAfee1985,
abstract = {A total of 61 biomechanical tests were performed on 25 cadaveric spinal segments  to investigate the comparative strengths of three instrumentation systems: 1) conventional Harrington distraction instrumentation (HRI), 2) segmentally wired Harrington distraction rods, and 3) Luque segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI). In type I testing in which axial preload was applied to normal specimens, and then progressive rotation until ultimate failure followed, five of six Harrington systems failed at the bone-metal interface. In contrast, all six Luque SSI vertebral segments disrupted in a location removed from the bone-metal interface. In Type-II testing (six specimens) in which axial loading of experimentally produced unstable burst fractures was applied, the most stable fixation in resisting compressive loads was segmentally wired Harrington distraction rods (P less than 0.001). In Type-III testing (six specimens), there was axial preloading, then progressive rotation applied to translational fracture-dislocations and this showed that the ability to resist torsion was lowest with plain HRI, slightly improved by segmentally wired HRI, and the stiffest system was Luque SSI (P less than 0.05). The three methods of testing cadaveric segments provided a relevant laboratory model for investigation of spinal instrumentation systems in thoracolumbar fracture stabilization. The results compare favorably with other biomechanical studies, information derived from in vitro and ex vivo animal models and clinical experience with failures of fixation. The biomechanical advantages of segmentally wired Harrington distraction instrumentation in resisting axial loads seem to justify this method of fixation in unstable burst fractures. Similarly, the use of Luque segmental spinal instrumentation with L-rods coupled together is the best method of achieving rotational stability in translational injuries (fracture-dislocations). However, the above biomechanical considerations should be balanced against the increased operative time, more exacting technical expertise required, and possible risk of iatrogenic neurologic sequelae in implementing segmental fixation in unstable thoracolumbar fracture management.},

This study evaluates the influence of the different treatments on the rate of complication, reduction of the fracture, and neurological recovery. METHODS: mechanism of injury, initial treatment and delay, neurologic deficit, operative findings, and duration of hospitalization were recorded. X-rays were reviewed for classification of fracture, measurement of deformity, and for instability scoring according to White and Panjabi's criteria. Seventy-seven patients were examined and nine more interviewed by telephone. RESULTS: a flexion-rotation injury occurred in 65{\%} and a burst-fracture in 29{\%}. A laminectomy was performed in 30 patients and Harrington instrumentation and fusion in 71 patients. Sixteen patients were treated conservatively. Fifty-five patients presented either a complete or partial neurological deficit. Seventy-five complications were noted and were more frequent in the laminectomy group. The instrumented group showed a clear tendency for earlier ambulation and discharge and pain level was found to be less. An increased residual deformity was found in patients treated by laminectomy, short fusion, and by nonsurgical modality. The neurologic recovery in the laminectomy and the nonlaminectomy group was not significantly different. Spinal realignment was better in the group where an instrumentation of five levels or more was performed and where posterior elements were not removed by laminectomy.},

Three of ten fragments had anteriorly rotated 90 degrees +/- 60 degrees, so that the cartilaginous end plate faced anteriorly; also, they had migrated 3-8 mm in a craniad or caudad direction. Six of ten patients had an associated vertical or Y-shaped fracture originating from the region of the basivertebral foramen and passing into the inferior one-half of the vertebral body. The presence of a retropulsed fragment is nearly pathognomonic of an axial compression injury.

The posterior column consists of what Holdsworth described as the posterior ligamentous complex. The middle column includes the posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior annulus fibrosus, and posterior wall of the vertebral body. The anterior column consists of the anterior vertebral body, anterior annulus fibrosus, and anterior longitudinal ligament. Major spinal injuries are classified into four different categories, all definable in terms of the degree of involvement of each of the three columns. Each type is defined also in terms of its pathomechanics, roentgenograms, and computerized axial tomograms, as well as in terms of its particular stability. The compression fracture is basically stress failure of the anterior column with an intact middle column. The burst fracture indicates failure under compression of both the anterior and middle columns. The seat-belt-type spinal fracture is the result of failure of the posterior and middle columns under tension with an intact anterior hinge. In fracture-dislocations, the structure of all three columns fails from forces acting to various degrees from one or another direction.},

This report describes our experience with left thoracotomy and descending aortic occlusion (T/AO) performed in the operating room (OR) for massive hemoperitoneum. During a 5-year period, 39 (5{\%}) of 791 patients undergoing laparotomy for acute injury required T/AO in the OR. According to protocol, T/AO was undertaken before celiotomy if systolic blood pressure (SBP) remained less than 80 mm Hg despite full resuscitation (23 patients), and after celiotomy if SBP fell to less than 60 mm Hg with upper abdominal hemorrhage (16 patients). Mechanism of injury was gunshot wound in 21, stab injury in eight, and blunt trauma in ten. Twelve patients (31{\%}) survived to leave the hospital. Seven of these individuals sustained hepatosplenic injuries, three had major vascular trauma, and the remaining two had combined injuries. Average SBP increased from 51 to 126 mm Hg following T/AO in the preceliotomy group, and from 48 to 131 mm Hg in post-celiotomy patients. The aorta was cross-clamped an average of 43 minutes in the preceliotomy patients, and 19 minutes in the post-celiotomy group. Six survivors (50{\%}) developed major abdominal complications (rebleeding, fistulae, abscess, and pancreatitis). Only two patients, however, had pulmonary problems associated with T/AO; and both were minor (atelectasis and recurrent pneumothorax). In our experience, T/AO in the OR is successful in salvaging nearly one third of patients with life-threatening abdominal hemorrhage. The procedure can be performed rapidly, safely, and with minimal late sequelae.},

Minor injuries are represented by fractures of transverse processes, facets, pars interarticularis, and spinous process. Major spinal injuries are classified into four different categories: compression fractures, burst fractures, seat-belt-type injuries, and fracture dislocations. These four well-recognized injuries have been studied carefully in clinical terms as well as on roentgenograms and computerized axial tomograms. They were then subdivided into subtypes demonstrating the very wide spectrums of these four entities. The correlation between the three-column system, the classification, the stability, and the therapeutic indications are presented.},

abstract = {We studied 100 consecutive patients with potentially unstable fractures and fracture-dislocations by multiplane computed tomography. The mechanism of failure of the middle osteoligamentous complex of the spine (posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior part of the vertebral body, and posterior annulus fibrosus) was determined by three-dimensional analysis. Three modes of middle-column failure were used to classify the injuries: axial compression (seventy-three patients), axial distraction (fifteen patients), and translation within the transverse plane (twelve patients). Fifty of eighty-six patients who were evaluated in the acute phase of injury underwent operative stabilization, and the mechanism of middle-column disruption determined the type of instrumentation that was used. Compression and distraction injuries of the middle complex could be appropriately treated by Harrington distraction and compression instrumentation, respectively. However, in translational injuries (torn posterior longitudinal ligament) routine Harrington instrumentation was contraindicated due to the risk of overdistraction. Translational injuries were associated with the greatest degree of instability and often had complete ligament discontinuity at the level of the affected vertebrae. Patients with a translational injury had the most severe neural deficits (six of eleven patients studied acutely having a complete spinal cord lesion). Translational injuries of the middle column were treated by segmental spinal instrumentation to provide strong fixation with minimum risk of neural sequelae from passing sublaminar wires. Moreover, postoperative use of a cast over insensate skin was not required. Computed tomography was more sensitive than any other modality in the diagnosis of disruption of the posterior elements in unstable burst fractures, and computer-reconstructed sagittal images were accurate in evaluating the nature of facet-joint failure in distraction injuries. Computed tomography with metrizamide proved superior to either conventional tomography or myelography alone in localizing the site of neural canal compromise in acute thoracolumbar injuries. The mode of failure of the middle osteoligamentous complex as visualized by computed tomography determined the pattern of spinal injury, the severity of the neural deficit, the degree of instability, and the type of instrumentation required.},

abstract = {A study of the hockey helmet and face shield as potential contributors to cervical spinal cord trauma (burst vertebral fractures and cord injury) was undertaken. The main concern was whether the alteration in the location of the c of m or in the mass moment of inertia (Icm) of a player's head, induced by a helmet and face shield, would predispose him to a hyperflexion neck posture. The c of m and Icm of a bare Hodgson-WSU humanoid headform (H) were first determined and then the same measures were made with a helmet (H + h) and with a helmet and face shield (H+h+f). Of the nine different helmet and face shields evaluated none caused the c of m to move more than 6mm from that of H. Measurements made on minor hockey players aged 8 to 15 years indicated that the proportion of maximum isometric neck strength required to hold the head in the typical skating posture while wearing a helmet and face shield ranged from 8{\%} to 12{\%}. It seems unlikely that this would predispose to the hyperflexion neck posture. The Icm of H+h increased by 68{\%} and of H+h+f by 89{\%} from that of H and when translated to a pivot point on the neck (C7-T1) the change in I was 30{\%} for H+h and 41{\%} for H+h+f. The effect on the neck of such an increase in I could lead to strain on the neck ligaments and musculature but would not account for a burst fracture of a vertebrae. Thus, in and of themselves, the helmet and face shield do not appreciably alter the dynamics of the neck thereby predisposing the wearer to increased neck injury risk.},

Forty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures causing encroachment of the spinal canal greater than 50{\%} were operated on within 30 days performing either: combined anterior decompression and stabilisation and posterior stabilisation (Group 1) or posterior distraction and stabilisation using pedicle instrumentation (AO internal fixator) (Group 2). We evaluated: neurological status (Frankel Grade), spinal deformities, residual pain, and complications. The average follow-up was 6 years. There were no significant differences between the patients in both groups concerning age, sex, cause of injury and the presence of other severe injuries. Neurological dysfunction was present in 39{\%} of all cases. Bony union occurred in all patients. Loss of reduction greater than 5 degrees and instrumentation failure occurred significantly more often in Group 2 compared to Group 1, but the kyphosis angle at late follow-up did not differ between groups, due to some degree of overcorrection initially after surgery in Group 2. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups, and all but one patient with neurological deficits improved by at least one Frankel grade. Indirect decompression of the spinal canal by posterior distraction and short-segment stabilisation with AO internal fixator is considered appropriate treatment for the majority of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. This is a less extensive surgical procedure than a combined anterior and posterior approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue injury from mechanical trauma often leads to secondary organ failure. Local accumulation of neutrophils and excessive release of toxic metabolites through inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis may be responsible for capillary leakage and irreversible damage of resident cells of injured tissues. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of apoptosis-inhibiting factors at the local site of tissue injury. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with severe head injury (n = 10; Abbreviated Injury Scale score, 4.5 +/- 0.2 points) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with serious chest trauma (n = 10; Abbreviated Injury Scale score, 4.1 +/- 0.1 points) were collected on days 1 and 3 after injury and compared with CSF (n = 5) and BALF (n = 16) obtained from patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Neutrophils from healthy humans were incubated with 10{\%} of CSF or BALF for 16 hours. Neutrophil apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide nuclear staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, and May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining. Levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in CSF and BALF were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: CSF and BALF from injured patients significantly inhibited spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis of healthy humans compared with control samples, whereas respiratory burst activity was enhanced (p {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, CSF and BALF from injured patients contained increased (p {\textless} 0.05) amounts of G-CSF. Neutralization of G-CSF in CSF and BALF from injured patients using monoclonal anti-G-CSF antibody markedly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced the apoptosis-inhibiting effect of those body fluids and decreased the respiratory burst. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe head or chest injury, G-CSF acts locally as a strong inhibitor of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, which may cause an increased destructive potential of neutrophils present in injured tissues.},

abstract = {To study snowboarding injuries in children and adolescents, a 6-year retrospective study was conducted of patients 18 years old and younger admitted to a pediatric trauma center after snowboarding accidents. The study was designed to identify the most severely injured patients. Comparison was made to data from a recent comparable study of skiing injuries. Twenty-seven patients were identified, all but one male and none under 10 years old. Nineteen were injured in a fall, 6 collided with a stationary object, one collided with a skier, and in one case the mechanism of injury was unclear. The average pediatric trauma score was 10.5, and the average injury severity score 10.2. Most of the 12 head injuries were minor. Most extremity fractures were to the upper extremity. There were two lumbar vertebral burst fractures, suggesting that the sport may predispose to this injury. There were no deaths. When compared with skiing, in snowboarding the overall severity of injury is lower, collision is a less common mechanism of injury and results in less serious injury, head injuries are less severe, the relative frequency of upper extremity fracture is higher, abdominal injuries are caused by falls rather than collisions, and facial injuries are less common. These differences are predictable on the basis of differences in the equipment. However, it is too early to say that snowboarding has less potential for life-threatening injury than skiing. Expected changes in the mix of participants, with an increase in the average skill level over time, may well result in different patterns, mechanisms, and severity of injury.},

In this study, we explored whether D2/E2-isoprostanes undergo dehydration in vivo to form A2/J2-isoprostanes. Oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro generated a series of compounds that were confirmed to be A2/J2-isoprostanes by mass spectrometric analyses. A2/J2-isoprostanes were detected in vivo esterified to lipids in livers from normal rats at a level of 5. 1 +/- 2.3 ng/g, and levels increased dramatically by a mean of 24-fold following administration of CCl4. An A2-isoprostane, 15-A2t-isoprostane, was obtained and found to readily undergo Michael addition with glutathione and to adduct covalently to protein. A2/J2-isoprostanes could not be detected in the circulation, even following CCl4 administration, which we hypothesized might be explained by rapid formation of adducts. This was supported by finding that essentially all the radioactivity excreted into the urine following infusion of radiolabeled 15-A2t-isoprostane into a human volunteer was in the form of a polar conjugate(s). These data identify a new class of reactive compounds that are produced in vivo as products of the isoprostane pathway that can exert biological effects relevant to the pathobiology of oxidant injury.},

The AO external spinal fixator (ESF) was applied to 5 human cadaveric lumbar spine specimens (L3-S1) at levels L4 to S1. All specimens were tested in 4 configurations: i) intact, ii) ESF in a neutral position, iii) ESF in distraction (12 mm), and iv) ESF in compression (8-12 mm). Cyclic sinusoidal axial compressive loads from 60 to 600 N were applied for 10 cycles in each test condition. The axial displacement of the load application point was recorded as an indicator of anterior column axial translation. The axial motion with the fixator in distraction was significantly greater than all other conditions, including intact. Compression of the fixator resulted in the least axial displacement. External fixation in the neutral position did not significantly affect the overall axial translation, when compared to the intact state. In conclusion, the external spinal fixator did not significantly reduce anterior column axial translation and, in distraction, this motion exceeded that of the intact specimen. Since pain relief is frequently observed during distraction of the painful segment/s with the external fixator, the mechanical basis of the pain relief is not well understood.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The X-ray and CT images of 99 consecutive patients treated for thoracolumbar spine fractures were analysed and the fractures were classified according to the above mentioned classifications. Using the 3-column model, the involvement of two or more columns was considered as unstable, whereas the fracture types A3.2, A3.3, B and C of the Magerl classification were defined as unstable. The stability evaluation was compared with the therapy decision and outcome. RESULTS: According to the 3-column model, 23 of 53 fractures which were classified as unstable were operated. Only five of the 30 conservatively treated unstable fractures showed a reduced healing process. The 46 stable fractures were treated conservatively with good results. Using the Magerl classification, 21 of the 28 unstable fractures were operated and 4 of the remaining 7 cases showed a reduced healing process. Of the 71 stable fractures only 2 were operated and in one patient minimal neurological symptoms occurred. CONCLUSION: The Magerl classification enables a more exact definition of stable and unstable spinal fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature contains few reports on negative outcomes after thoracoscopic spinal surgery. METHODS: From November 1995 to February 1998, 90 patients underwent minimally invasive spinal surgery by thoracoscopic assistance as treatment for their anterior spinal lesions. The diagnoses included 41 spinal metastases, 13 cases of scoliosis, 12 burst fractures, 10 cases of tuberculous spondylitis, 8 cases of pyogenic spondylitis, 2 thoracic disc herniations, 2 cases of ankylosing spondylitis with discitis, 1 osteoporotic compression fracture, and 1 case of thoracolumbar kyphosis. The procedures included biopsy only (3 patients); thoracic discectomy (3 patients); multilevel anterior releases, discectomy, and fusion (14 patients); corpectomy for decompression (6 patients); corpectomy and interbody fusion (32) patients; and internal instrumentation (28 patients). RESULTS: A total of 30 complications were noted in 22 patients (24.4{\%}). Two fatal complications occurred, resulting from massive blood transfusion in one case and postoperative pneumonia in another. Other nonfatal complications included four cases of transient intercostal neuralgia, three superficial wound infections, three cases of pharyngeal pain, two cases of lung atelectasis, two cases of residual pneumothorax, two cases of subcutaneous emphysema, one inadvertent pericardial penetration due to adhesion, one chylothorax that resolved after conservative management, one vertebral screw malposition, and one graft dislodgement that needed late revision surgery. Three patients required ventilatory support for longer than 72 hours. Five patients with spinal metastases had an estimated intraoperative blood loss of more than 2,000 ml. No injury to the internal organs or spinal cord was observed. There were four conversions to open procedures due to two cases of severe pleural adhesions and two poorly tolerated one-lung ventilation. At the latest follow-up, nine patients had died as a result of cancer dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: (a) Well-selected patients and attention to details are essential to optimizing surgical results. (b) A refined technique for less invasive tumor surgery has been developed. (c) Surgeons had better experience with the standard anterior spinal approach and showed no hesitation in converting to an open procedure when necessary. A procedure failure does not mean a treatment failure.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the outcome of neurologically intact patients with three column thoracolumbar junction burst fractures that were treated nonsurgically. OBJECTIVE: To further define the parameters for nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many texts list involvement of the posterior column as an indication for surgery and state that casting or bracing is mandatory. This has not been the authors' experience. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with nonpathologic, single-level burst fractures of T11, T12, L1, or L2, and with posterior element fractures were studied retrospectively. The selection criteria required that the patient be neurologically intact, that the pedicles and facet joints not be fractured or dislocated, and that the angle of kyphosis be less than 35 degrees. The extent of retropulsion, loss of vertebral height, and presence of lamina or process fractures were not criteria. No attempt was made to reduce the fracture. Patients were allowed immediate ambulation as tolerated. Jewett braces were used in nine patients, but no bracing was used in the remainder. RESULTS: There were 22 males, 16 females. Median age 37 years (range, 16-65). Fracture involved both endplates in 16 patients (12 crush-cleavage type), the superior end-plate in 21, and the inferior endplate in 1. The hospital stay was from 2 to 18 days (median, 8 days). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years (range, 2.1-6.3). All patients remained neurologically intact. Eight patients had no pain, 24 had minimal pain, 4 had moderate pain, and 2 had moderate to severe pain. Twenty-nine of 38 patients (76{\%}) were able to work at the same level. The initial kyphosis angle averaged 20 degrees (range 10-35 degrees). At follow-up it averaged 24 degrees (range 12-38 degrees). The maximum increase was 6 degrees. Some degree of retropulsed fragment resorption was noted in 35 cases. Complications were limited to transient urinary retention. There were no thromboembolisms, decubitus ulcers, or pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Despite the use of less restrictive criteria, no brace, and early activity as tolerated, the results are similar to those obtained with more restrictive protocols. The presence of vertical lamina fracture, spinous process fracture, and transverse process fracture are not contra--indications. Activity restriction and bracing may be important for pain control but probably does not change the long-term result.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation between the degree of traumatic canal impingement and neurologic improvement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies on this subject have been reported, but the results have varied. METHODS: From 1986 to 1993, 148 consecutive cases of burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine were evaluated by studying the following: 1) the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal by computed tomography scans, 2) damage to the posterior element of injured vertebra by computed tomography scans, 3) the neurologic deficits and improvement by Frankel grade. RESULTS: The average percentage of canal compromise was higher in the patients with neurologic deficit (52{\%}) than in the patients with no neurologic deficit (35{\%}). The degree of neurologic impairment was higher in the group with disruption of the posterior elements (62.9{\%}) than in the group with intact posterior elements (29.8{\%}). The degree of neural improvement was greater in the group with disruption of the posterior elements (60.7{\%}) than in the group with no disruption of the posterior elements (25{\%}). These differences were statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The disruption of posterior elements indicated a more significant neurologically injured status on first examination; in those cases, however, the presence of disrupted posterior elements indicated a high possibility of neurologic recovery.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A static nondestructive bending analysis of pedicle screws inserted into vertebral analogues was conducted. Pedicle screw load was studied as a function of variables in insertion technique. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the sagittal bending moment in pedicle screws is affected by changes in pedicle screw length, insertional depth, and sagittal placement. BACKGROUND DATA: An unexpectedly high rate of clinical failure has been observed in pedicle screws used in short-segment instrumentation for unstable burst fractures. The majority of screws fail in sagittal bending within the pedicle. Little is known of the insertion technical factors that affect in situ loads incurred by pedicle screws. METHODS: Synthetic vertebral analogues were fabricated. Pedicle screws internally instrumented with strain gauges were used as load transducers to determine screw bending moments within the pedicle and body of the analogue. Analogues were loaded in compression to simulate loading of an unstable burst fracture. RESULTS: Screw bending moments within the pedicle increased 33{\%} and 52{\%} when screws were left 3 mm and 5 mm short of full insertion. Intrapedicular moments increased 20{\%} to 29{\%} in screws inserted superiorly or inferiorly within the pedicle. Thirty-five-millimeter screws developed intrapedicular moments 16{\%} higher than 40-mm and 45-mm screws. CONCLUSIONS: In situ pedicle screw loads increased significantly as a direct result of variations in surgical technique. Screws left short of full insertion, placed off center in the sagittal plane of the pedicle, or less than 40 mm long developed increased intrapedicular bending moments.},

abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To report a series of 38 patients presenting retroperitoneoscopic inter-body fusion of the lumbar spine from L2 to L5, performed between 1995 and 1998. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This series included 25 women and 13 men aged from 16 to 74 years (mean age: 48.5 years). Surgery was performed in 32 patients for primary degenerative or post-operative instability of the lumbar spine, in five patients for painful sequels of burst fracture, and in one patient for sequels of disc infection. The main complaint was lumbar pain but a real sciatic pain was present in nine patients and was not a contraindication for this surgery. Standard X-rays were performed for each patient, and MRI performed in 30 patients confirmed the diagnosis and was also useful in determining vascular abnormalities. A cast immobilisation of the lumbar spine was done as a preoperative test in every patient. RESULTS: Forty-two levels were fused: 31 with a cage filled with cancellus bone and screwed between the end plates, and 11 with cancellus bone alone or in association with bone substitute, such as beta TCP. Post-operative complications included only a transient paresthesia of the thigh in two cases and a chyloretroperitoneum spontaneously resolutive. After 2.3 months of plaster immobilisation with a follow-up of 11.4 months, patient satisfaction rate was 84.5{\%}, with 68.5{\%} reporting no further back pain. The improvement was estimated by Prolo score. Fusion was considered effective by X-ray examination in all patients with an increase in the intervertebral space of 35{\%} and a recovery of the local lordosis of 15{\%}. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneoscopic surgery is an elegant and secure method for lumbar interbody fusion of L2 to L5 with very few postoperative complications.},

The purpose of this study was to review the types of spinal injuries that resulted from falls from hunting tree stands. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients who came to our institution for treatment of spine injuries related to tree-stand accidents between 1981 and 1997. Eleven percent of the falls were alcohol related. Mean height of the fall was 19.6 feet (range, 10 to 35 feet). There were 17 burst fractures, 8 wedge compression fractures, 4 fractures involving the posterior elements, and 1 coronal fracture of the sacral body. Significant neurologic injury occurred in 12 patients (44{\%}). Sixteen patients (59{\%}) had associated injuries. Nine patients (33{\%}) had open reduction, internal fixation, and fusion of their spine fractures. One patient was treated with a halo jacket. The remaining patients were treated in rigid, molded, polypropylene thoracolumbar orthoses or lumbosacral corsets. Accidental falls from tree stands may result in significant spinal fractures often associated with concomitant neurologic injury, extended hospitalization, and permanent disability. Many of these injuries may be prevented through aggressive hunter safety education.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective revue of the long-term outcome of posterior Louis plate fixation for the treatment of irreducible or ligamentously unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine with or without neurologic deficit. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical, radiologic, and functional status of patients who underwent posterior fracture fixation with Louis plates and to evaluate the effect of instrumentation length on the construct's ability to maintain reduction of the fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Since the development of pedicle screw fixation described by Roy-Camille, there has been a rapid evolution in the number and complexity of systems available for posterior spinal stabilization. Along with this escalation in implant and instrument sophistication, there has been a corresponding increase in implant cost. To date, no series has been reported of the clinical, radiologic, and functional results of posterior instrumentation with semirigid Louis plates for spinal fractures. METHODS: A retrospective review of spinal fractures from T11 to L5 treated since 1985 by posterior plate fixation showed that 56 patients (37 men and 19 women) with an average age of 34 years and a minimum follow-up of 2 years (average, 41 months) were available for review. There were 36 burst fractures, 4 Chance fractures and 16 fracture-dislocations treated. Forty-three patients had neurologic injury. RESULTS: Before surgery, vertebral kyphosis averaged 15 degrees, improved to 5 degrees with reduction, and reached a steady 10 degrees at final follow-up. Similarly, corrected kyphosis initially averaged 12 degrees but improved to 0.5 degree with reduction, and was 10 degrees at final follow-up. Vertebral canal compromise initially averaged 50{\%} but was reduced to 13{\%} with surgery and 6{\%} at 1 year. There was no significant difference between the ability of short and long constructs to maintain reduction. Eighty-eight percent of patients with neurologic injury improved at least one Frankel grade with treatment. Functional and pain evaluation by the Denis scale showed 25 patients rated P1, 25 rated P2, and 6 rated P3. Twenty-eight were rated W1, 16 were W3, and 12 were W5 at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine can be treated effectively with the semirigid Louis plating system. Because of its low cost and ease of insertion, the Louis system is an excellent choice for short arthrodesis and instrumentation of these fractures. Although there is some loss of reduction when compared with more rigid systems, there is no functional compromise in these patients.},

There were 75 thoracolumbar fractures of which 26 were treated conservatively and 37 by posterior reduction and fusion with an AO internal fixator. We identified six different types of disc using criteria based on the morphology and the intensity of the MRI signal. The inter- and intraobserver variability of this system was good. Most of the discs showed predominantly morphological changes with no variation in signal intensity. Some disc types were associated with progressive kyphosis in patients treated conservatively. In those managed by operation, recurrent kyphosis appeared to result from creeping of the disc in the central depression of the bony endplate rather than from disc degeneration. Changes in the disc space after posterior fixation should not be seen as a form of chronic instability but as a redistribution of the disc tissue in the changed morphology of the space after fractures of the endplate.},

@article{Keen1998,
abstract = {Genetic factors play an important role in determining bone mineral density (BMD)  in later life, with the genetic influence mediated through effects on both peak mass and on age- and menopause-related bone loss. At menopause there is an increase in the production and activity of various cytokines and growth factors within the bone microenvironment. The activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a powerful stimulant of osteoclastic bone resorption, is increased in estrogen-deficient states with increased production of IL-1 and inhibition of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Treatment with IL-1ra blocks the bone loss associated with ovariectomy in animals and the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN) is therefore a potential candidate gene for the regulation of postmenopausal bone loss. We examined the relationship between annual rates of change in BMD over 5 years and an 86 bp variable number tandem-repeat polymorphism of the IL-1RN gene in 108 early postmenopausal women. All women were within 5 years of a natural menopause at the study's onset, healthy, and not on hormone replacement therapy or other medication known to affect bone metabolism. BMD was measured annually over the 5 year study period at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Three alleles were identified (A1 = 4 repeats, A2 = 2 repeats, A3 = 5 repeats), with five genotypes observed: A1A1 (41.7{\%}), A1A2 (45.4{\%}), A2A2 (6.5{\%}), A1A3 (2.8{\%}), and A2A3 (3.7{\%}). For analysis, alleles were collapsed into a biallelic system grouping the A1 and A3 alleles. There was no significant relationship between the IL-1RN genotypes and baseline bone mass at either the spine or hip. IL-1RN genotype was significantly associated with annual rates of change in spinal bone mass (p {\textless} 0.05), and this finding remained significant after adjustment for age, weight, and baseline BMD. Carriage of at least one copy of the A2 allele was associated with reduced bone loss at the spine (mean change in BMD +/- SD: -0.81 +/- 1.46{\%}/year) when compared with noncarriage of the A2 allele (mean change -1.38 +/- 1.48{\%}/year), p = 0.05. We therefore conclude that allelic variation at the IL-1RN locus is associated with differential rates of early postmenopausal bone loss at the spine. Further research will be required to clarify the mechanisms underlying these findings and to determine whether this association translates into a significant long-term effect on BMD and fracture in later life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causes and physiopathology of low-back pain and acute lumbar radiculopathy remain unclear. A compression of the nerve root by protruded disk has been suggested but explains only partially the physiopathology of radicular pain. This article provides an overview of the role of inflammation in disk herniation-associated radiculopathy. METHODS: A review of the relevant literature in American and European medical journals was performed. RESULTS: Several studies have identified inflammatory mediators (phospholipase A2, prostaglandin E2, leukotrienes, nitric oxide, immunoglobulins, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin [IL]-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha]) and autoimmune reaction (macrophages expressing IL-1beta, intercellular adhesion molecules) in disk herniation. An appealing hypothesis is that the leakage of these agents may produce an excitation of the nociceptors, a direct neural injury, a nerve inflammation, or an enhancement of sensitization to other pain-producing substances (such as bradykinin), leading to the nerve root pain. However, the role of these inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of lumbar radiculopathy has not been proven. Several findings suggest that this inflammatory response, which occurs in the early stage of disk herniation, is transient. Indeed, most studies of chronic disk herniation samples failed to demonstrate inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although inflammation may partially explain lumbar radiculopathy, involvement of inflammatory mediators in the physiopathology of disk herniation-associated radiculopathy has not been proven.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was carried out using Shen instrumentation, which is a modified pedicle rod sleeve spinal system, to perform reduction and fusion in patients with unstable thoracolumbar fracture. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that the simple, locally made pedicle rod sleeve instrumentation is as effective as conventional systems in the management of thoracolumbar fractures. The current results are also compared with those reported in the literature. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: Many instrumentations, such as Harrington, Luque, and Dick, have been used for the management of thoracolumbar fracture in the past 2 decades. Every device has its advantages and disadvantages based on clinical practice and the biomechanical mechanism of reduction. METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 1995, 96 consecutive patients who had experienced unstable thoracolumbar fractures were treated surgically with Shen instrumentation, which consists of four components: superior pedicle screws, distraction rods, sleeves, and inferior laminar hooks. Of these 96 patients, 76 were male and 20 were female (age range, 16-68 years; mean, 37 years). Thirty patients had partial paraplegia and 38 patients had complete paraplegia, according to the Frankel classification. Injury categories were as follows: 43 burst fractures, 26 flexion-compression fractures, 22 fracture-dislocation injuries, and 5 flexion-distraction injuries. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 39 months (range, 24-60 months). Kyphotic deformity was corrected from 27.1 degrees before surgery to 4.2 degrees after surgery, translation was reduced from 30.7{\%} to 0{\%}, height of compressed vertebral bodies was restored from 52.3{\%} to 96.5{\%} of the normal height. Computed tomographic evaluation showed that the cross-canal area was restored from 48.1{\%} before to 70.9{\%} after surgery. Improvement of neurologic function of more than one Frankel grade occurred in 90{\%} of patients. CONCLUSION: Based on the understanding of biomechanics and the present clinical results, Shen instrumentation is as efficacious as conventional devices available today and may serve as a cost-effective option for thoracolumbar injuries, especially in a developing country.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both surgery and recumbency have been adopted in the treatment of spinal fractures. Herein we present the indications for each, and our experience with thoracolumbar junction (T12, L1 and L2) burst fractures. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated operatively in 36 cases, and nonoperatively in 32 with recumbency for 1-6 weeks. Treatment was based on clinical and radiological criteria. Eighty-one percent of the recumbency patients, but only 14{\%} of the surgical patients were intact on admission. Patients were followed for a mean+/-SD of 9+/-10 months in the recumbency group, and 21+/-21 months in the surgical group. RESULTS: Neurological improvement and progressive angular deformity occurred in both groups. The cost of recumbency in our patients was nearly half that of those who required surgery, though the length of hospitalization between the two groups was similar at 1 month +/-2 weeks. CONCLUSION: The above study emphasizes that the selection of operative versus nonoperative treatment in burst fractures should not be random but based on clinical as well as radiological criteria. Recumbency is favored in patients who are intact, with angular deformity less than 20 degrees , a residual spinal canal greater than 50{\%} of normal, and an anterior body height exceeding 50{\%} of the posterior height. Surgical intervention is generally indicated in patients with partial neurological deficit, and those with severe instability.},

abstract = {To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system). Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases. We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55{\%}, postop. 80{\%}) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop. 58{\%}, postop. 78{\%}). 10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occurred. Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52{\%}) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51{\%}) than those without (40{\%} or 39{\%}). There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit. Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated. In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded. In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Forty-two conservatively treated patients with a burst fracture of  the thoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbar spine with more than 25{\%} stenosis of the spinal canal were reviewed more than 1 year after injury to investigate spontaneous remodeling of the spinal canal. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the natural development of the changes in the spinal canal after thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical removal of bony fragments from the spinal canal may restore the shape of the spinal canal after burst fractures. However, it was reported that restoration of the spinal canal does not affect the extent of neurologic recovery. METHODS: Using computerized tomography, the authors compared the least sagittal diameter of the spinal canal at the time of injury with the least sagittal diameter at the follow-up examination. RESULTS: Remodeling and reconstitution of the spinal canal takes place within the first 12 months after injury. The mean percentage of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal was 50{\%} of the normal diameter (50{\%} stenosis) at the time of the fracture and 75{\%} of the normal diameter (25{\%} stenosis) at the follow-up examination. The correlation was positive between the increase in the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and the initial percentage stenosis. There was a negative correlation between the increase in the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal and age at time of injury. Remodeling of the spinal canal was not influenced by the presence of a neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Conservative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures is followed by a marked degree of spontaneous redevelopment of the deformed spinal canal. Therefore, this study provides a new argument in favor of the conservative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanical study on the stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the addition of a calcium phosphate cement into the fractured vertebral body through a transpedicular approach is a feasible technique that improves the stiffness of a transpedicular screw construct. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Short segment pedicle screw instrumentation is a commonly used method for reduction and stabilization of unstable burst fractures. Recent investigators, however, have reported a high rate of instrumentation failure and sagittal collapse when there is a loss of anterior column support. In this study, the ability of a new hydroxyapatite cement to augment anterior column support was investigated in a burst fracture model. METHODS: A cadaveric L1 burst fracture model was stabilized using short segment pedicle screw instrumentation. Specially instrumented-pedicle screws recorded screw-bending moments. The L1 vertebral body was reinforced with the hydroxyapatite cement through a transpedicular approach. Mechanical testing of the instrumented and instrumented-reinforced constructs were performed in flexion, extension, side bending, and torsion. Construct stiffness and screw-bending moments were recorded. RESULTS: Transpedicular vertebral body reconstruction with hydroxyapatite cement reduced pedicle screw-bending moments by 59{\%} in flexion and 38{\%} in extension. Mean initial stiffness in the flexion-extension plane was increased by 40{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in these parameters with lateral bending or torsional movements. CONCLUSIONS: This hydroxyapatite cement compound augments anterior column stability in a burst fracture model. This technique may improve outcomes in burst fracture patients without the need for a secondary anterior approach.},

abstract = {Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma. This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing. Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable. Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation. In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS:30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique. While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression. At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate. This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue. All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident. In four patients with severe craniocerebral trauma or manifest shock, the procedure was changed to plate osteosynthesis after application of primary external fixation. Secondary injuries (joint and pelvic fractures or craniocerebral trauma) delayed early loading in 12 cases. Four patients were mobilized postoperatively under partial loading. A fixation callus was radiologically detectable on average 6 weeks after surgery. This often allowed additional loading, depending on the secondary injuries. Full loading was possible after 14 weeks. Complications included one case of surgery-related malpositioning, one soft-tissue infection, one case of plate detachment after a fall and one case of periosseous calcification. There were no cases of bone infections or pseudoarthroses. Elastic plate osteosynthesis is thus a conservative osteosynthesis procedure with a low complication rate in polytraumatized patients, even in those with simple femoral fractures.},

This article describes the use of intraoperative ultrasonography during spinal surgery. From 1990 to 1997, 116 spinal fractures were treated operatively at our clinic. Stabilization of the spine was achieved with the AO fixateur interne and the AO USS, respectively (Synthes, D-79224, Umkirch, Germany). For 60 cases who had a fractured posterior vertebral surface dislocated into the spinal canal, we used intraoperative ultrasonography to monitor the repositioning of the narrowing fragments. The patients underwent pre- and postoperative computed tomography scans (CT). In six cases, color-coded duplex sonography was performed intraoperatively to view the A. spinalis anterior. In 58 cases, the spinal canal and the fractured posterior surface of the vertebrae were visualized successfully. The sonographic image was inconclusive in two cases with severely damaged fragments. Identical findings were observed on the intraoperative ultrasound image after completion of repositioning and on the postoperative CT scan. In six cases, the A. spinalis anterior was viewed by color-coded duplex sonography with a different flow before and after fracture repositioning. Intraoperative ultrasound is a valuable means of monitoring the restoration of the spinal canal by a posterior approach. The method is easy to perform and can be repeated as often as required. Color-coded duplex sonography allows further visualization of the A. spinalis anterior.},

Ten patients with unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were included in the open prospective investigation, and were treated by a surgical technique consisting of a dorsolateral approach to the injured segment, filling the disk space and the fractured vertebra with autologous bone, and transpedicular fixation with an AO internal fixator. All patients were followed for 6 to 12 months after surgery by clinical tests and spinal X-rays. Excellent short-term and long-term results were obtained. A stable bony fusion was achieved in all cases, and a minimal mean decrease of 2 degrees in the kyphosis angle was found at late follow-up. No major complications related to the procedure were encountered, and no worsening of neurological deficits occurred after surgery. In conclusion, the far-lateral approach to the thoracolumbar spine yields results which are equivalent or better than those of standard techniques. Major advantages of our procedure, as evaluated in this rather small group of patients, are selective immobilization of the injured segment without involvement of functionally intact spinal levels, no manipulations within the spinal canal boundaries, and relatively limited exposure of the spine.},

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are laboratory studies documenting the biomechanical advantages of the AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems. There have been no previous comparisons of the internal spinal skeletal fixation system with the Hartshill rectangle and sublaminar wiring in matched patient groups.

RESULTS: The initial restoration of normal spinal anatomy was good using both systems. However, on examination 2 years after surgery, it was found that the AO system provided significantly superior maintenance of both middle (P {\textless} 0.01) and anterior column anatomy (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The AO internal spinal skeletal fixation systems is associated with significantly superior maintenance of spinal anatomy 2 years after surgery.},

abstract = {Changes in the canal diameter during physiological motions are important considerations in the treatment of patients who have a burst fracture with the presence of bony fragments, but without neurologic deficit. In this in vitro study, the changes in the soft-canal diameter of the thoracolumbar region, when intact and after different fractures, was investigated under several different loading conditions. The soft-canal diameter was clearly identified on the lateral radiographs by attaching a series of steel balls to the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum in the midsagittal plane. Endplate, wedge, and burst fractures were produced incrementally in 19 three-vertebrae human cadaveric spine specimens by high-speed impacts. After each injury, a series of functional lateral radiographs were taken. The minimal canal diameter (MCD) was obtained by digitizing the images of the steel balls on radiographs using a custom-designed computer program. In the intact specimens, the MCD at the disc level changed significantly in flexion, extension, and compression, when compared with the MCD in the unloaded neutral position. However, the changes were small. The MCD after endplate and wedge fractures changed in a similar way. However, after the burst fracture, the MCD at the bone fragment level increased remarkably by a distraction force. It also significantly improved by an anterior shear force in comparison to the corresponding MCD in the neutral position. However, this change was smaller than the change due to the distraction force.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Pedicle fracture was simulated in an in vitro model, and its effect on multidirectional stability provided by pedicle instrumentation was quantified. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the multidirectional flexibility of padicle instrumentation due to different iatrogenic pedicle injuries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Misplacement of the screw and iatrogenic pedicle fracture are the main complications of pedicle instrumentation. Despite the increasing number of clinical studies dealing with this issue, there is little reliable information concerning the biomechanical effects of an intraoperative pedicle fracture. METHODS: A burst fracture was created in 10 human cadaveric five-vertebrae spine specimens, from the middle and lower thoracic spine regions. The fracture was stabilized with a semirigid pedicle screw fixation device. To simulate an intraoperative pedicle fracture, the pedicles of the instrumented segments were resected in four steps. After each pedicle injury, three-dimensional flexibility in the form of range of motion and neutral zone of the construct was determined and compared with the intact values. RESULTS: Resection of the pedicles had little effect on the multidirectional flexion-extension stability provided by the instrumentation. There were significant increases of axial rotation in the middle thoracic spine when the lateral wall was resected (range of motion, 8.2 degrees vs. 3.6 degrees; neutral zone, 4.2 degrees vs. 1.7 degrees), whereas in the lower thoracic spine, significant increases occurred only when all the pedicles were resected (range of motion, 3.8 degrees vs. 1.4 degrees; neutral zone, 1.1 degrees vs. 0.4 degree). Lateral resection of the pedicle resulted in significant increases of range of motion and neutral zone for lateral bending in both the middle thoracic spine (range of motion, 19.0 degrees vs. 10.0 degrees; neutral zone, 2.4 degrees vs. 1.1 degrees) and the lower thoracic spine (range of motion, 4.3 degrees vs. 2.5 degrees; neutral zone, 0.9 degree vs. 0.3 degree). CONCLUSIONS: Resection of the pedicles results in a significant decrease in axial rotation and lateral bending stability provided by the instrumentation. This effect was higher in the middle than in the lower thoracic spine and may be relevant to pedicle fractures produced by pedicle screws used in these regions.},

After a mean of more than 3 years, 56 of 62 patients (90{\%}) still alive who had their implants removed were examined. According to the ASIF classification 33 patients sustained type A fractures, 13 type B and 10 type C. Three patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal; in one case of complete paraplegia no change occurred. In 40 cases the dorsal instrumentation was combined with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The mean operative time totaled 3 h. In this series, two complications (3.6{\%}) were observed: one iatrogenic vertebral arch fracture without consequences and one deep infection. Compared to the preoperative status, our follow-up examinations demonstrated permanent physical and social sequelae; the percentage of individuals able to do physical labor was reduced by half (22 to 11 patients) whereas the share of unemployed or retired patients doubled (4 to 8 patients). At the time of follow-up examination only 21 of 42 patients continued in sports. The assessment of complaints and functional outcome with the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" reflected a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.001) between the status before injury (96.6/100 points) and at the time of follow-up (71.4/100 points). The radiographic assessment in the lateral plane (Cobb technique) demonstrated a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) mean restoration from an initial angle of -15.6 degrees (kyphosis) to +0.4 degree (lordosis). Serial postoperative radiographic follow-up showed progressive loss of correction; at follow-up examination we found a mean of 10.1 degrees (P {\textless} 0.001). Compared to the preoperative deformity a mean improvement of 6.1 degrees to an average of -9.7 degrees at follow-up examination was noted. The addition of transpedicular cancellous bone grafting did not decrease the loss of correction. CT scans after implant removal were performed in 9 cases: only 3 of 9 patients showed evidence of intervertebral fusion. No correlation could be found between ASIF classification and radiographic outcome. However, the preoperative wedge angle of the vertebral body correlated significantly with the postoperative loss of reduction. Due to disappointing results after dorsal stabilization with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting we recommend a combined procedure with dorsal stabilization and ventral fusion in cases of complete or incomplete burst injury of the vertebral body.},

This study is based on high resolution x-ray images of 56 isolated thoracolumbar vertebrae and thick sections obtained from them. A previously undescribed array of trabeculae was documented which originated from the medial corner of the base of the pedicles and extended in a radial array throughout the vertebral body. This trabecular array persisted even in severely osteoporotic specimens. The cortex of the vertebral canal thinned abruptly near the base of the pedicle creating what may be a stress concentration at this site. This corresponded to the site of origin of the trabecular array. The presence of this possible stress concentration, in proximity to the trabecular array, may provide an explanation for the trapezoidal shape of the bony fragments that are frequently retropulsed into the spinal canal in axial load type burst fractures, common in this area of the spine.},

abstract = {Only a few plate systems are available for anterior fixation of thoracolumbar vertebrae because of the difficulty in fastening a screw and a plate together. If the fixation is inadequate, the screws will become loose. The Rigix plate system consists of screws made of titanium alloy and a plate made of pure titanium. All screws used for internal fixation are screwed into the plate. This system permits the use of anchor screws, which facilitate exertion of force to compress the vertebral bodies together or to distract them from each other. In this study, Rigix plates were used in 24 patients (20 with burst fractures and 4 with metastatic tumors). In the 20 patients with fracture, internal fixation with a graft and a Rigix plate was performed after anterior decompression. In the four patients with malignant tumors, total spondylectomy was performed anteriorly and posteriorly, followed by implantation of a vertebral prosthesis, and then internal fixation with a Rigix plate combined posterior instrumentation with Diapson (Stryker Co., Tokyo, Japan) pedicular screws. Bone union was achieved in all patients. Neither breakage of instruments nor loosening of connections occurred in any case. In patients treated for bone metastases, the reconstructed spinal structure was able to be maintained for a long period. Of the screws used, five (5{\%}) were not able to remain fixed as intended because they were inserted at inappropriate angles into the plate, but the fixation itself was excellent. Because of the low profile, ease of manipulation (mean instrumentation time was 25 min), and compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging, the Rigix plate is useful for anterior fixation of thoracolumbar vertebrae.},

METHODS: Eight human cervical spine specimens (levels C1 to T3) were fractured by axial impact, and the resulting burst injuries were documented using post-injury radiographs and computed tomography scans. Canal occlusion was measured using a custom transducer in which water was circulated through a section of flexible tygon tubing that was passed through the spinal canal. Any impingement on the tubing produced a rise in fluid pressure that was monitored with a pressure transducer. Each spine was positioned in flexion, extension, lateral (and off-axis) bending, axial rotation, traction, and compression, while canal occlusion and angular position were monitored. Occlusion values for each position were compared with measurements taken with the spine in neutral position. RESULTS: Compared with neutral position, compression, extension, and extension combined with lateral bending significantly increased canal occlusion, whereas flexion decreased the extent of occlusion. In extension, the observed mechanism of occlusion was ligamentum flavum bulge caused by ligament laxity resulting from reduced vertebral body height. CONCLUSIONS: Increased compression of the spinal cord after injury may lead to more extensive neurologic loss. This study demonstrated that placing a burst-fractured cervical spine into either extension or compression significantly increased canal occlusion as compared with occlusion in a neutral position.},

abstract = {To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal. There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD):(1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage. MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture. None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability. We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree. The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc). Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation. With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised. The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone. Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to use MR imaging to determine the frequency of injury to the posterior ligament complex of the thoracolumbar spine in patients who have undergone acute thoracolumbar trauma. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with varying severity of thoracolumbar trauma were examined prospectively. The majority of injuries were related to motor vehicle accidents. The second most common cause was falls. Patients were examined with plain radiography and MR imaging. In addition to conventional MR imaging sequences consisting of T1-weighted and fast spin-echo T2-weighted sagittal and axial images, a fat-suppressed T2-weighted sagittal sequence was performed. The findings were correlated with surgery in six cases and with follow-up clinical examination that included physical examination and conventional anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. RESULTS: Posterior ligament complex injury was detected in 53{\%} (n = 36) of all patients. Such injury was most common in patients with flexion-distraction (n = 15) and patients with dislocation fracture (n = 4). Of the patients with dislocation fracture, all had posterior ligament complex injury. Of the 24 patients with burst fractures, posterior ligament complex tear occurred in 42{\%} (n = 10). Of the 23 patients with compression fractures, 26{\%} (n = 6) had posterior ligament complex tear. Injury to the interspinous ligaments occurred with decreasing frequency in patients with injury to the supraspinous ligament, flaval ligaments, posterior longitudinal ligament, and anterior longitudinal ligament. Surgical findings correlated with MR imaging in all six patients who underwent surgery. CONCLUSION: Injury to the posterior ligament complex, which is often encountered in patients with burst and compression fractures, can be reliably revealed by MR imaging.},

Early devices presented both biomechanical and technical problems. The AO Anterior Thoracolumbar Locking Plate (ATLP) was designed to solve some of the problems encountered with early anterior instrumentation. The ATLP system is constructed in Commercially Pure titanium. It is a low profile device indicated for use for unstable burst fractures in the anterior column; metastatic tumor management; and degenerative diseases of the thoracolumbar spine between levels T10 and L5. Implantation of the device involves direct anterior decompression with sagittal reduction and corpectomy. This is followed by grafting reconstruction, and plate fixation. This device has been implanted in 25 patients with an average follow-up of 38 months. There were five (5) broken screws in three (3) patients, and no broken plates. Implant related postoperative complications included two misplaced screws. Preliminary results indicate that the ATLP system seems to be a safe, low profile, MRI/CT compatible device that provides definitive single stage fixation of the anterior spinal column.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a device that allows continual bone graft vertebral endplate compression and determine its potential for healing in patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior spinal surgery has led to implant adaptations. Such implants have undergone an evolution in hopes of improving the rate of healing and avoiding neurovascular catastrophes. METHODS: Thirty-six patients underwent anterior decompression dynamized instrumentation and fusion for thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. This involved a dual-rod, quadrilateral, cross-linked frame that allows for continual compression but deters rotation and shear stresses. RESULTS: All patients healed solidly without instrumentation failure. An average recovery of 1.3 Frankel grades was recorded. Subsidence of bone graft vertebral endplate was less than in those placed in a trough. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamized load-sharing anterolateral Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation led to solid bone graft healing without implant failure by allowing continual compression while deterring shear and rotational stresses.},

These fixation systems have evolved to meet the anatomic, biomechanical, and imaging challenges associated with internal fixation of the thoracolumbar spine. The evolution of these devices will be reviewed, and from this, the indications and surgical techniques necessary for the safe and effective use of the device will be discussed. This study also reports the authors' initial clinical experience using the Z plate anterior thoracolumbar plating system in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The study consists of 12 consecutive adult patients who underwent a 1-stage anterolateral decompressive and stabilization procedure for burst fractures from T9-L3. The indications for surgery included neurologic deficits, deformity, progressive kyphosis, and late pain. Ten of the 12 patients maintained their postoperative sagittal alignment or a significant portion of their kyphosis reduction. Two patients with severe kyphotic deformities greater than 50 degrees lost 10 degrees and 20 degrees of their reduction at last followup. All 3 patients with neurologic deficits recovered. There were no neurologic or perioperative complications. Eleven of the 12 patients obtained a good or excellent functional outcome. Anterior arthrodesis using instrumentation stabilization after a 1-stage anterolateral decompression and reduction procedure can yield successful clinical results in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {Based on a retrospective review of 101 injuries of the thoracolumbar spine operated at the Orthopaedic and Traumatological Clinic of the Third Medical Faculty, Charles University in 1991-1995 the authors followed up a group so-called pincer fractures. A typical feature of these fractures is a comminuted zone of the median portion of the vertebral body, dislocation of the anterior fragment of the vertebral body in a forward direction and filling of the gap which thus arises with material from the torn intervertebral disc. "Pincer" fractures tend to develop into pseudoarthroses. In the investigated group 14 fractures of this type were found (14 {\%}). All injuries were treated from a posterior approach by internal AO fixation or USS fixation resp. in two patients in the second stage an anterior approach was used and the vertebral body was substituted. Based on analysis of the initial morphology of the fractures and the peroperative reponibility of the dislocated fragment of the anterior part of the vertebral body the injuries were classified into three groups and indication criteria for surgery were established. Groups with a non-dislocated or reponible anterior fragment can be treated from the back only by instrumentation, posterior fusion and transpedicular spongioplasty with transpedicular intercorporal desis, the group with an irreponible anterior fragment must be treated by posterior instrumentation and fusion and subsequently from an anterior approach by substitution of the vertebral body and anterior fusion.

abstract = {In a prospective study, the systemic inflammatory consequences of surgery-induced lung tissue injury were evaluated using biochemical markers. The aim was to examine whether this type of injury produces a specific pattern of prostanoid plasma levels (prostacyclin, thromboxane, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and PGM). We, therefore, compared 18 patients (group 1) who underwent thoracotomy without injury to the lung with 26 patients (group 2) that had a resection of pulmonary tissue due to benign diseases. Group 2 patients clearly revealed increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein as well as of the granulocyte-specific PMN-elastase. In particular, there was a pronounced release of prostacyclin and its antagonist thromboxane A2 following lung tissue resection. In contrast to group 1 patients, lung tissue damage resulted in immediately elevated plasma levels of PGF2 alpha and PGE2. When, however, taking into account the time course of PGM, the stable cleavage product of PGF2 alpha, there was no hint of an altered pulmonary metabolic capacity. Presumably, this pattern of elevated prostanoid levels in group 2 is the result of the surgical damage to the lung tissue. Therefore, it can be suggested to be specific for that type of injury. Thus, the release of prostanoids following surgery-induced lung tissue damage may indicate the importance of these mediators, particularly in thoracic injuries associated with lung damage since those may lead to post-traumatic pulmonary dysfunction. These substances may also be useful in evaluating both the severity and the extent of lung tissue damage following major trauma.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is a new modality which allows visualization of, and access to the intrathoracic organs without thoracotomy. Recently, this technique has been used for anterior thoracic spine approach to perform surgery which previously required standard postero-lateral thoracotomy. The authors report their initial experience of anterior spinal fusion using thoracoscopy and give a detailed description of their surgical procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This technique, started on June 1993, was performed only in one level 1 in 10 patients who had thoracic spine trauma with fracture or luxation. The procedure was performed in the lateral decubitus position. The patient was prepared in the standard manner for a full thoracotomy. Surgical instruments that are needed for conversion to an open procedure must be in the operative room. Ventilation was stopped to the ipsilateral lung. Lung's collapse of the surgical side was obtained with a double lumen tube. Carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation was used to further collapse. The first thoracoscopic portal was placed through the sixth or seventh intercostal space in the posterior axillary line, which was the safest place. All subsequent portals were placed under thoracoscopic visualization, in a triangular way as recommended by Landreneau (1992). Only open trocars were used to avoid complication of CO2 insufflation. Once the target level has been defined, a needle was placed into the disc space and roentgenographic confirmation obtained. The parietal pleura was then divided using monopolar electrocautery. Segmental vessels of the operation field lied transversely across the midportion of the vertebral body. They were mobilised and systematically ligated with endoscopic clip to simplify the procedure. Then the intervertebral space was opened and bone and disc were removed, restricted to the anterior and middle third. The graft was placed into the thoracic cavity by using a high density calcium hydroxyapatite ceramic block. Peroperative radiologic control ascertained the good position of the implant. At the end of the procedure a chest tube was placed through the lower trocar site and the lung re-expanded. A post operative CT Scan controlled good position of the graft and complete lung expansion. Contra-indications for VATS are previous surgical procedures or empyema causing extensive pleural adhesions. Procedures not appropriate for VATS approach are some that require anterior instrumentation for stabilisation, burst fracture, or fracture with posterior wall involved. RESULTS: The planned procedure was accomplished in all but one patient who required conversion to an open procedure because of segmental artery bleeding. Mean operative time was 1 h 45 mm, and mean estimated blood loss was 650 cc. There was no complication from CO2 insufflation neither postoperative complication. With an average of 2 years follow up, anterior grafting is as good as an open technique, radiologic evaluation according to Uchida (1990) showed good incorporation of each block without any radiolucent line or displacement. DISCUSSION: According to literature this technique was performed safely in 10 cases, especially without any respiratory complications and chronic pain (impairement of pulmonary function, re-expansion failure, incisional complications, rib fractures, chronic pain and malfunction of the chest wall, limitation of shoulder girdle motion) which are considered to be the main disadvantage of traditional thoracotomy. Many authors previously used VATS for multi level thoracic discectomy for correction of spinal deformities (Mack 1995), spinal reconstructive surgery (Mac Afee 1995) or removal of protrude thoracic disc (Rosenthal 1994). CONCLUSION: This original technique demonstrates that thoracoscopy for anterior thoracic surgery is better for the patients, reducing surgical trauma of the chest wall and to the lung parenchyma (in term of post operative comfort, sh},

Six linear geometric parameters were measured on each film. The ratio of each value in the neutral injured to the intact condition was correlated linearly with the motion parameters obtained from post-traumatic three-dimensional flexibility data (neutral zone NZ; range of motion ROM). Anterior unit height (vertebra+adjacent discs) had the highest correlation with the neutral zone and flexibility in all directions, especially flexion-extension (NZ, R2 = 0.93; flexion ROM, R2 = 0.86; extension ROM, R2 = 0.79) lateral bending (NZ, R2 = 0.83; ROM, R2 = 0.90) and right axial rotation (NZ, R2 = 0.53; ROM, R2 = 0.86). The deformation ratio (average height to depth) correlated most with the neutral zone in left axial rotation (R2 = 0.91) and right lateral bending (R2 = 0.92). Due to the high correlations obtained, these parameters should be evaluated in clinical situations to assess their effectiveness in predicting the instability of burst fractures. Ultimately, prospective clinical studies are required to verify their clinical utility.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Nine patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures associated with horizontal fractures in the posterior column were studied retrospectively. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the clinical and radiographic findings and evaluate the postoperative results for this type of fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It is not well recognized that burst fractures occasionally are accompanied by horizontal fractures of the posterior column such as those that result from seatbelt-type injuries. This type of burst fracture differs from flexion-distraction injuries combined with burst fracture, which are accompanied by horizontal fractures not only in the posterior but also in the middle column. Radiographic features of these two different types of injuries are very similar to each other, and their differentiation in diagnosis and treatment has not been recognized clearly. METHODS: Patients were reviewed using a combination of clinical records, follow-up examination, and radiographic data (computed tomography [CT], plain radiographs, and tomographs). Anterior spinal fusion was performed in eight patients using the Kaneda device (Mizuhoika Tokyo, Japan), and one was treated by posterior fusion with pedicle screw fixation. The average follow-up period was 4 years. RESULTS: Patients with fractures of this type represented 21{\%} of the 48 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. The injury was sustained by falling in all nine patients. All of the burst fractures were Denis' type B. The horizontal fracture was located at the lamina and spinous process in the posterior column of the upper vertebra adjacent to the involved vertebra in all nine patients. The integrity of the ligamentous structures of the middle column, such as the posterior longitudinal ligament, the periosteum, and the outermost anulus, was confirmed at surgery in eight patients, although not in the patient who underwent posterior fusion. One patient required surgery because of progression of kyphotic deformity during conservative treatment. Solid fusion with no complications was noted in all patients. CONCLUSION: This type of burst fracture is not accompanied by ligamentous injuries because of distraction force in the middle column, which is not present in flexion-distraction injuries, but it seems to be more unstable than burst fractures with no horizontal splitting of the posterior column and requires surgical stabilization.},

abstract = {One hundred and fifty consecutive patients who had a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine and associated neurological deficits were managed with a single-stage anterior spinal decompression, strut-grafting, and Kaneda spinal instrumentation. At a mean of eight years (range, five years to twelve years and eleven months) after the operation, radiographs showed successful fusion of the injured spinal segment in 140 patients (93 per cent). Ten patients had a pseudarthrosis, and all were managed successfully with posterior spinal instrumentation and a posterolateral arthrodesis. The percentage of the canal that was obstructed, as measured on computed tomography, improved from a preoperative mean of 47 per cent (range, 24 to 92 per cent) to a postoperative mean of 2 per cent (range, 0 to 8 per cent). Despite breakage of the Kaneda device in nine patients, removal of the implant was not necessary in any patient. None of the patients had iatrogenic neurological deficits. After the anterior decompression, the neurological function of 142 (95 per cent) of the 150 patients improved by at least one grade, as measured with a modification of the grading scale of Frankel et al. Fifty-six (72 per cent) of the seventy-eight patients who had preoperative paralysis or dysfunction of the bladder recovered completely. One hundred and twenty-five (96 per cent) of the 130 patients who were employed before the injury returned to work after the operation, and 112 (86 per cent) of them returned to their previous job without restrictions.

Posterior transpedicular decompression, fixation, and fusion were used primarily for two symptomatic patients with less than 40{\%} encroachment and at most 40{\%} compression. Overall, 21 patients (84{\%}) were walking and 18 (72{\%}) were continent at follow-up evaluation (mean 16.3 months) versus eight (32{\%}) and 11 (44{\%}) at presentation, respectively. Preoperatively, 17 patients experienced neurological deficit; 16 improved and 12 increased one Frankel grade. No patient deteriorated. Prior employment or activity level was resumed by 19 patients (76{\%}) and only four patients professed incapacity. Pain was eliminated after 18 procedures (72{\%}), all anterior or combined approaches. Restoration of anatomical alignment ({\textless} 5 degrees) was achieved in 19 cases. No anterior construct failed and only one patient treated posteriorly had postoperative kyphosis progression. Operative morbidity occurred in three cases (12{\%}). Satisfactory neurological and functional outcomes were achieved in a majority of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures after correction of canal compromise, middle column compression, and attendant deformity. These results indicate that anterior decompression and a weight-bearing strut graft are critical to clinical success in patients with significant vertebral destruction.},

abstract = {It is not uncommon to misdiagnose a burst fracture as a wedge compression fracture initially on plain film, resulting in a late progressive deformity and neurologic damage. The purpose of this study was to analyze the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of plain radiographs in the diagnosis of thoracic and lumbar burst fractures using the posterior bow (PB) and vanishing line (VL) signs. Seven independent examiners, comprising three chief orthopedic residents, two radiologic third-year residents and two emergency attending physicians (orthopedists), randomly reviewed 26 sets of admission anteroposterior and lateral thoracolumbar spine radiographs taken in association with back injuries. They were asked to decide whether patients had a burst or a wedge compression fracture. All patients had computed tomography (CT) scans for diagnostic confirmation. The overall initial sensitivity using discriminant analysis in the diagnosis of burst fractures was 80{\%}. This increased to 90{\%} after the examiners were requested to use the PB and VL signs. The specificity decreased slightly from 75{\%} to 71{\%}, while the positive predictive value remained at 88{\%}. Overdiagnosis of wedge compression fractures as burst fractures occurred, especially when the quality of the films was not ideal. We conclude that, with careful reading, the PB and VL signs help in identifying burst fractures on the initial plain film evaluation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A great deal of controversy exists regarding the potential benefit of pelvic lymph node irradiation compared with treatment to the prostate only in patients with localized prostate cancer. Despite numerous reports, including a randomized study, this issue has not been completely elucidated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 963 patients with histologically proven localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiation therapy alone were analyzed. Median follow-up was 6.5 years (minimum: 2 years, maximum: 22 years). Pelvic lymph nodes received 40 to 55 Gy with anteroposterior/posteroanterior and sometimes lateral stationary portals in 1.8 Gy daily fractions; an additional dose was delivered to the prostate with 120 degrees bilateral are rotation to complete doses of 65 to 68 Gy for Stage A2 and B tumors and 68 to 71 Gy for Stage C tumors. The same total doses were delivered with smaller fields when the prostate only was treated. RESULTS: In Stage A2 (T1b,c) the 10-year clinical pelvic failure rate was 16{\%} regardless of the volume irradiated or tumor differentiation. With Stage B (T2) well- or moderately differentiated tumors, the 10-year pelvic failure rates were 22{\%} when pelvic lymph nodes were irradiated and 32{\%} when prostate only was irradiated (p = 0.41). With Stage A2 (T1b,c) and B (T2) poorly differentiated tumors, the 10-year pelvic failure rates were 32{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively (p = 0.72). With clinical stage C (T3) well-differentiated tumors treated with 50 to 55 Gy to pelvic lymph nodes, the pelvic failure rate was 22{\%} compared with 37{\%} in those receiving 40 to 45 Gy (p {\textless} or = 0.07). A significant reduction in pelvic failures was noted with Stage C poorly differentiated tumors when the pelvic lymph nodes received doses higher than 50 Gy (23{\%}) compared with lower doses (46{\%}) (p {\textless} or = 0.01). Volume or doses of irradiation did not influence incidence of distant metastases in any stage or tumor differentiation group. Disease-free survival did not correlate with volume treated in any clinical stage or tumor differentiation group. In 317 patients on whom pretreatment prostate-specific antigen levels were available, there is a suggestion that those treated to the pelvic lymph nodes had a higher chemical disease-free survival than those receiving prostate irradiation only. Follow-up is short, and differences are not statistically significant in any of the groups. Morbidity of therapy was slightly higher in patients treated to the pelvic lymph nodes, but in Stages A2 (T1b,c) and B (T2) differences are not statistically significant (4 to 6{\%}). Stage C patients treated to the pelvic lymph nodes with 50 Gy had a 12{\%} incidence of Grade 2 rectosigmoid morbidity compared with 6{\%} in those treated with 40 Gy (p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, pelvic lymph node irradiation did not influence local/pelvic tumor control, incidence of distant metastases, or disease-free survival in patients with clinical Stage A2 (T1b,c) or B (T2) localized carcinoma of the prostate. In patients with Stage C (T3) disease, irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes with doses of 50 to 55 Gy resulted in a lower incidence of pelvic recurrences and improved disease-free survival. Morbidity of therapy was acceptable, although patients with Stage C disease had a somewhat higher incidence of Grade 2 rectosigmoid morbidity. Pelvic lymph node irradiation is being elucidated in properly designed prospective, randomized protocols.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study to review the results of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures managed with casting or bracing and early ambulation in neurologically healthy patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical outcome of patients with unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine treated without surgery, and to identify any variables that may adversely influence the final outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The management of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine as described by Bedbrook involves a period of recumbency for 6-8 weeks followed by gradual mobilization. Newer techniques of surgical stabilization of the fracture and decompression of the neural elements have become popular because immediate stability of the spine is created and because the need for prolonged bedrest and hospitalization is eliminated. There have been only three reports in the literature describing the nonoperative management of these fractures with early mobilization; some authors believe that this is appropriate only if the posterior column is intact. The results reported in the literature of nonoperative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures have indicated that this is an effective method of management. METHODS: A retrospective review of 26 patients with unstable burst fractures in the thoracolumbar region (T11-L2) was performed; follow-up evaluation was obtained from 24 patients. Clinical follow-up examination was performed by the use of a questionnaire in which the patients were asked to rate their pain, ability to work, ability to perform in recreational activities, and their overall satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time for the 24 patients was 34.3 months. Mean duration of hospitalization was 8.2 days; those patients who did not have injuries other than their spine fracture had a mean hospitalization time of 5.9 days. Kyphotic deformity could be corrected with hyperextension casting but tended to recur during the course of mobilization and healing. No correlation was found between kyphosis and clinical outcome. At final follow-up evaluation, 19 patients (79{\%}) had little or no pain; 18 patients (75{\%}) had returned to work; 18 (75{\%}) stated that they had little or no restrictions in their ability to work, and 16 (67{\%}) stated that they had little or no restrictions in their ability to participate in recreational activities. Only one patient (4{\%}) reported being dissatisfied with the initial nonoperative treatment of his spine fracture. Ten patients were found to have evidence of spinous process widening on plain films; there was no significant difference in the clinical or radiographic outcome of these 10 patients when compared with the 14 others who did not have interspinous widening. CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures with hyperextension casting or bracing was proven to be a safe and effective method of treatment in selected patients. Clinical results were favorable; no neurologic deterioration was observed; hospitalization times were minimized, and patient satisfaction was high. The authors do not believe that ligamentous injury of the posterior column is a contraindication to nonoperative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of delayed diagnosis of major thoracolumbar vertebral fractures (T-L Fxs) in ED multiple-trauma patients, and to determine the differences between cases of delayed and nondelayed diagnoses of T-L Fx. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 181 trauma patients with 310 major T-L Fxs (compression, burst, or chance Fxs or dislocations). Data collected included the time of the diagnosis of T-L Fx, the patient's clinical presentation in the ED, the mechanism of injury, and the outcome. RESULTS: Of the 181 patients with major T-L Fxs, 138 were diagnosed in the ED (nondelayed group), and 43 were diagnosed after the patient left the ED (delayed group). Of these, 33 cases occurred in unstable patients requiring emergent medical imaging and/or operation, 7 occurred when emergency physicians failed to detect subtle compression Fxs on ED radiographs, and 3 occurred in stable patients who were not radiographed in the ED. The delayed group were more often critical, and hypotensive, and had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores than did the nondelayed group. The delayed group patients also had more cervical spine injuries, multiple noncontiguous spinal Fxs, high-energy mechanisms of injury, and direct blunt assaults to the back than did the nondelayed group patients. There were 13 patients with T-L Fxs, GCS scores = 15, and normal back examinations. There were 43 patients who had neurologic deficits associated with their injuries; 11 patients with incomplete cord lesions progressed, including 3 in the delayed group. CONCLUSIONS: A delay in the diagnosis of T-L Fx in hospitalized trauma patients is frequently associated with an unstable patient condition that necessitates higher-priority procedures than ED T-L spine radiographs. Such patients should receive spinal precautions until more complete evaluation can be performed. The decision to selectively radiograph T-L spines in multiple-trauma patients should consider the mechanism of injury, the presence of possible confounders to physical examination, and clinical signs and symptoms of back injury.},

Thirty patients had been managed non-operatively with a short period of bed rest followed by protected mobilization. The remaining twenty-five patients had been managed operatively: eight, with posterior arthrodesis with long-segment hook-and-rod fixation; eight, with posterior arthrodesis with short-segment transpedicular fixation; six, with posterior arthrodesis and instrumentation followed by anterior decompression and arthrodesis; and three, with anterior decompression and arthrodesis. Thirty-six patients had been neurologically intact at the time of presentation and had remained so throughout the follow-up period. No neurological deterioration or symptoms of late spinal stenosis were seen. Isolated partial single-nerve-root deficits resolved regardless of the method of treatment. Patients who had had a complete single or a multiple-nerve-root paralysis seemed to have benefited from anterior decompression. Although the anatomical results as seen on the most recent radiographs were superior for the group that had been managed operatively with long posterior fixation or anterior and posterior arthrodesis, the most recent pain scores and the functional outcomes were similar for all treatment groups. At the latest follow-up evaluation, some loss of spinal alignment was noted in the patients who had been managed with short transpedicular fixation; the alignment at the most recent follow-up examination was comparable with that in the patients who had been managed non-operatively. For the patients who had had non-operative treatment, we were unable to predict the deformity at the time of follow-up on the basis of the initial diagnostic radiographs. The clinical outcome was not related to the deformity at the latest follow-up evaluation. On the basis of the results of our study, we recommend non-operative treatment for patients who do not have neurological dysfunction or who have an isolated partial nerve-root deficit at the time of presentation. For patients who have a multiple-nerve-root paralysis, anterior decompression is indicated.},

The combined expertise is not only helpful initially when managing these difficult patients, but also later as problems develop. This study describes a treatment protocol and reports the early results of 23 patients with unstable pelvic fractures and associated bladder or urethral disruptions, or both, treated surgically with open reduction and internal fixation of the anterior pelvic ring injuries at the same anesthetic and using the same surgical exposure as the urethral realignments or bladder repairs or both. Early complications occurred in four patients (17{\%}): one patient sustained a fifth lumbar nerve injury caused by the pelvic reduction procedure, and three patients had anterior pelvic internal fixation failures. Late complications occurred in eight patients (35{\%}). There was one deep wound infection (4.3{\%}) that presented 6 weeks after injury. Late urological complications occurred in seven patients (30{\%}). Four of the nine male patients with urethral disruptions had urethral stricture after their primary urethral realignments (44{\%}). Three of the 18 male patients admitted to impotence (16.7{\%}). One of the three had a residual thoracic paraplegia caused by a burst fracture. One of the five female patients had urinary incontinence and required a bladder suspension operation to restore normal function (20{\%}). A low infection rate can be expected despite the use of internal fixation. Early urethral "indirect" realignments avoid more difficult delayed open repairs; however, late urological complication rates are still high. Early "direct" bladder repairs are easily performed at the time of anterior pelvic open reduction and internal fixation. Suprapubic tubes are not necessary to adequately divert the urine when large diameter urethral catheters are used in these patients.},

abstract = {The burst fracture is an injury characterized by anterior vertebral body height loss and retropulsion of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body into the spinal canal. The vertebral body injury frequently is associated with fractures through the neural arch. Using a three-column concept of spinal stability, the division of these fractures into stable and unstable injuries is difficult. Radiographic signs of instability include widening of the interspinous and interlaminar distance, translation of more than 2mm, kyphosis of more than 20 degrees, dislocation, height loss of more than 50{\%}, and articular process fractures. However, fractures may be unstable in the absence of these signs. Unrecognized supraspinous ligament disruption contributes to this instability. This structure is best evaluated by MR examination. Confirmation of posterior ligamentous disruption occurring in conjunction with the burst fracture leads to reevaluation of the presumed mechanism of injury. This article discusses the many issues surrounding the division of burst fractures into stable and unstable injuries and reexamines the common classification systems of thoracolumbar spine injuries.},

METHODS: From 1990 to 1994, a total of 50 patients with prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were in state A2, 34 in stage B and 5 in stage C according to clinical stage. Extended disease was observed pathologically in 45{\%}, and 59{\%} of patients in clinical stages A2 and B, respectively. Preoperative serum PSA levels were closely correlated with pathological extension of the disease. The disease-free rates for organ-confined disease, extended disease without lymph node metastasis and stage D1 disease were 75{\%} (3 years), 82{\%} (2 years) and 80{\%} (3 years), respectively. Four patients had rectal injuries, and three of these underwent temporary colostomy diversion. Two patients had bladder neck contracture and received internal urethrotomy. Urinary incontinence improved in 60{\%} of patients during the first 6 post-operative and in 90{\%} of patients within 12 post-operative months. Urinary incontinence tended to improve earlier in patients with nerve-sparing than those without it. The erectile capacity in nerve sparing patients recovered good. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that radical prostatectomy is a safe and temporarily satisfactory treatment for the patient with organ-confined prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study analyzed the clinical and radiologic results of two groups of patients with unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine treated with anterior decompression, reduction of the kyphotic deformity, and stabilization by grafting and instrumentation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the results regarding loss of correction of two groups of patients treated with two different configurations of the same instrumentation, the so-called "Slot-Zielke" device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Decompression of burst fractures and reduction of kyphotic deformity are facilitated by the anterior approach to the spine. The maintenance of reduction depends on the strength of the grafting material and on the rigidity of the internal fixation. METHOD: Forty consecutive patients with spine fractures underwent surgery for anterior decompression, reduction of kyphotic deformity, and stabilization by grafting and instrumentation. The first group of 25 patients (Group A) received a single rod "Slot-Zielke" device as an implant. The second group of 15 patients (Group B) received a double rod "Slot-Zielke" device. Before and at least 2 years after surgery, the kyphotic angle between the vertebrae above and below the fracture was measured. RESULTS: The clinical results at follow-up evaluation were similar between the groups. In Group A, 60{\%} of the cases had a loss of correction of 5 degrees or more (least square mean, 5.64 degrees; range, 0-23 degrees). In Group B, the loss of correction in all cases was less than 5 degrees (least square mean, 1.60 degrees; range, 0-4 degrees). The difference between the average of both groups was highly significant (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The double rod instrumentation performs significantly better regarding loss of correction compared with the single rod instrumentation.},

OBJECTIVES: Because of its strategic position within the vertebral body, its structure could be of relevance for spinal surgery. During the positioning of cannulated pedicle screws and before penetration into the cancellous bone of the vertebral body, resistance had to be overcome inside the "pedicle" of the vertebral arch. Was this point of resistance related to the neurocentral joint? SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Data on the fate of this developmental structure after age 3-6 years, the age at which it fuses, appeared to be missing in literature. METHODS: We examined dry bone and "fresh" vertebrae from individuals ranging in age from 0 to 75 years. Observations were recorded by means of gross anatomic photographs, micrographs, radiographs, and computed tomography scans. RESULTS: After fusion of the junction at age 3-6 years, its structure persists through life as a bilateral plate of bone extending from the cranial to the caudal anular epiphyses inside the dorsolateral parts of the definitive body. CONCLUSIONS: This plate may function as a support for pedicle screw fixation. Its form explains typical burst fractures of the vertebral body. Spondylolysis at this site is unknown.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study investigated the outcome of anterior decompression and stabilization for "unstable" burst fractures without initial neurologic deficits in the thoracolumbar spine. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pain and work status of the patients, who underwent the anterior decompression and stabilization, to evaluate the relationship between residual back pain and the degree of kyphosis, and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of surgery for burst fractures without initial neurologic deficits in the thoracolumbar spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A retrospective review was conducted on 45 patients with unstable burst fractures in the thoracolumbar spine treated by anterior decompression and stabilization in our institutions from 1982 to 1993. Nineteen patients were available for this study. Ten patients were men and 9 were women. Their age at surgery ranged from 15 to 76 years (average, 46 years). The duration of follow-up ranged from 24 to 84 months (average follow-up, 54 months). METHODS: All clinical charts and radiologic data of these patients were reviewed by the first author. Their pain, work, and employment statuses were assessed by the scales proposed by Denis in 1984. RESULTS: Nine patients were rated P1, 7 were rated P2, 2 were rated P3, 1 was rated P5, 11 were rated W1, 3 were W2, 1 was W3, and 4 were rated W5. Even the physical laborers' return to work averaged 5 months after surgery (range, 3-12 months). The postoperative kyphotic angle ranged from -6 degrees to 45 degrees (average, 11 degrees), and it remained -5 degrees to 45 degrees (average, 12 degrees) at final follow-up. There was no statistical correlation between the kyphotic angle and the pain scale. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior decompression and stabilization for unstable burst fracture without initial neurologic deficits in the thoracolumbar spine has some advantages in the view of anatomical reduction and rigid stability that allows patients an early rehabilitation, return to work, and gainful employment.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This biomechanical study of fractures in cadaver vertebrae used specially designed pedicle screws to determine screw strains during loading of two different fixation constructs. OBJECTIVES: The authors determined the relative benefit of adding offset sublaminar hooks to standard pedicle screw constructs to reduce screw bending moments and prevent fixation failure and sagittal collapse. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Clinical studies have demonstrated a high incidence of early screw failure in short-segment pedicle instrumentation constructs used to treat unstable burst fractures. Strategies to prevent early construct failure include longer constructs, anterior strut graft reconstruction, and use of offset sublaminar hooks at the ends of standard short-segment pedicle instrumentation constructs. METHODS: Human cadaver spines with an L1 burst fracture were instrumented with a standard short-segment pedicle instrumentation construct using specially instrumented pedicle screws. Mechanical testing was carried out in flexion, extension, side bending, and torsion, and stiffness and screw bending moments were recorded. Offset hooks were applied initially, then removed and testing repeated. Stiffness data were compared to intact and postfracture results, and between augmented and standard constructs. RESULTS: Addition of offset laminar hooks, supralaminar at T11 and infralaminar at L2, to standard short-segment pedicle instrumentation constructs increased stiffness in flexion by 268{\%}, in extension by 223{\%}, in side bending by 161{\%}, and in torsion by 155{\%} (all were significant except torsion). Sublaminar hooks also reduced pedicle screw bending moments to roughly 50{\%} of standard in both flexion and extension (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental offset hooks significantly increase construct stiffness without sacrificing principles of short-segment pedicle instrumentation, and absorb some part of the construct strain, thereby reducing pedicle screw bending moments and the likelihood of postyield deformation and clinical failure.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Herniated lumbar disc specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical discectomy for persistent radiculopathy and cultured in vitro to determine whether various biochemical agents were being produced. OBJECTIVES: Our hypothesis is that biochemical mediators of inflammation and tissue degradation play a role in intervertebral disc degeneration and in the pathophysiology of radiculopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low back pain with or without radiculopathy is a significant clinical problem, but the etiology of low back pain and the exact pathophysiology of radiculopathy remain elusive. The biochemical events that occur with intervertebral disc degeneration and, in particular, the role of biochemical mediators of inflammation and tissue degradation have received sparse attention in the literature. There is some preliminary evidence that inflammatory mediators may have an important role in the pathophysiology of radiculopathy. METHODS: Eighteen herniated lumbar discs were obtained from 15 patients undergoing disc surgery. The specimens were cultured and incubated for 72 hours, and the media were collected subsequently for biochemical analysis. Biochemical assays for matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and a variety of cytokines were performed. As a control group, eight lumbar disc specimens were obtained from four patients undergoing anterior surgery for scoliosis and traumatic burst fractures, and similar biochemical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The culture media from the herniated lumbar discs showed increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase activity compared with the control discs. Similarly, the levels of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6 were significantly higher in the herniated discs compared with the control discs. Interleukin 1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein, and substance P were not detected in the culture media of either the herniated or control discs. CONCLUSIONS: Herniated lumbar discs were making spontaneously increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6. These products may be involved intimately in the biochemistry of disc degeneration and the pathophysiology of radiculopathy. Their exact roles certainly need further investigation, but their mere presence implicates biochemical processes in intervertebral disc degeneration.},

abstract = {Between 1985 and 1992, 84 burst fractures were surgically managed with anterior decompression, autologous iliac crest strut graft, and posterior instrumentation and fusion. Fifteen were lost to follow-up, leaving 69 patients for detailed review. Of the 22 patients with complete or partial neurologic injury, 12 patients either totally or partially recovered function following surgery. Of these 12 patients, 6 improved 1 Frankel grade; 5 improved 2 Frankel grades, and 1 improved 3 Frankel grades. Follow-up was 12 to 91 months (average 41 months). For all of the fractures in this series, the mean operative correction in sagittal kyphosis was 14 degrees, but this decreased to 7 degrees at final review. No patient had significant scoliosis, and 66 patients achieved solid arthrodesis with 3 pseudoarthroses (4{\%}). Mean operative time for 2-in-1 procedures was 5 hours 42 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 1,455 mL. Of 62 patients available for follow-up telephone interview, 42 (68{\%}) had minimal or no pain; 11, mild pain; 8, moderate pain; and 1, severe pain. Function in daily activities was assessed as normal or minimally impaired in 43 of 51 patients (84{\%}) with normal neurologic function by physical examination. We conclude that anterior decompression, strut autografting, and posterior instrumented autogenous fusion, either as a combined or staged procedure, is a safe surgical option for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of spinal canal areas in 67 consecutive burst fractures between T12 and L2 treated by reduction and stabilization with a pedicle fixator. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the efficacy of "indirect" spinal canal decompression in a large series of burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Up to 50{\%} of burst fractures cause neurologic impairment. Reduction and posterior instrumentation is the most common surgical treatment. This also reduces spinal canal encroachment by indirect decompression. No consensus exists as to the consistency and adequacy of such indirect decompression. METHODS: Spinal canal areas were measured on preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans. The degree of encroachment was compared with clinical and radiographic variables for possible correlation. RESULTS: Spinal canal encroachment was more severe among patients with neurologic deficits than among the neurologically intact. Postoperatively, mean encroachment was reduced from 35{\%} to 12{\%} at T12, from 37{\%} to 17{\%} at L1, and from 52{\%} to 35{\%} at L2. Loss (and postoperative restoration) of anterior vertebral height correlated best with the degree of canal encroachment (and its reduction), especially in Denis Type A burst fractures. In Denis Type B fractures, canal compromise usually was less severe and fragment reduction better in patients older than 40 years of age than in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect decompression in burst fractures averages about half of the preexisting encroachment. Results are usually better at T12 and L1 than at L2. Additional or secondary decompression is rarely indicated if these fractures are treated early and by experienced surgeons. Burst Type B fractures in patients older versus younger than 40 years of age differ in many respects.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures using a generic and a condition-specific health status survey. The SF-36 survey (generic) and the Roland scale (condition-specific) were administered to 24 patients who had a minimum of 2 years follow-up after a thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit. The average SF-36 score was 65{\%} (compared to 45{\%} for dialysis and 66{\%} for diabetes) and the Roland score was 65{\%} (compared to 58{\%} for low back pain). Of the patients, 33{\%} were able to return to their previous employment, but only 8{\%} were able to return to their pre-injury level of sports. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.71) between the Roland scale and the SF-36 pain scale. There were poor correlations between the Roland scale and residual kyphosis (r = 0.003), and between the SF-36 pain scale and residual kyphosis (r = 0.10). There was no significant difference in the functional outcome of those patients treated operatively versus nonoperatively.},

The purpose of the study was the identification of the existing correlation between the posttraumatic spinal canal stenosis and the initial neurological deficit. The presence of Dall and Stauffer type II fracture statistically constitutes an important factor, with negative involvement, in the diagnosis of the initial neurological status. In thoracolumbar spine, there is an inversely proportional relation with statistical importance between the level of injury and the post-traumatic spinal stenosis-as the burst fracture is sited higher, smaller canal encroachments by fragments will produce the same neurological deficit.},

Group 2 received rigid internal fixation with AO 2.7-plates from an intraoral approach, group 3 internal fixation with miniadaption-plates also from an intraoral approach. Using a standardized treatment protocol the patients were followed in defined intervals up to a maximum of 2 years after therapy. Group 1 presented with the lowest complication rate, group 2 with the highest rate of overall complications as far as disturbances of the occlusion and sensory disturbances were concerned. Except one plate fracture in group 3 with subsequent pseudarthrosis, which required a reosteosynthesis with a rigid plate, no major complications in bone healing were observed.},

These patients underwent instrumentation using a short construct of hooks and screws gripping the two vertebrae above the lesion (2HS) and screws and hooks gripping the first vertebra below the lesion (1SH). This construct was therefore called "2HS-1SH". In order to evaluate just the material resistance after getting up, only the patients who were upright on the 4th day without a body cast and with no secondary anterior osteosynthesis were included in this study. Four patients showed some neurological symptoms on admission but recovery was so quick that they could be included in this study. Mean follow-up was 4 years 1 month (range 3 years 1 month and 6 years 2 months). Vertebral and regional kyphosis angles were measured preoperative, postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Functional recovery and complications were analyzed. Mean vertebral kyphosis was 21.2 degrees preoperatively, 3.8 degrees postoperatively and 5.3 degrees at the final follow-up. Regional kyphosis angles were respectively 19.2, 0.2, and 2.7 degrees. We had two cases of deep suppuration, one early and the other late. None of the patients required analgesics for more than 6 months after the operation. Patients returned to work after 5 months on average. The authors concluded that fixation by screw-and-hook constructs is an effective way to stabilize thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.},

There were 20 burst fractures, 2 fracture/dislocations, and 9 compression fractures in this group. Average preoperative Sagittal Index was 35 degrees, which improved to an average of 4 degrees after surgical treatment. The average Motor Index Score improved from 90 to 98 after surgery.

It was concluded that the late problems associated with thoracolumbar fractures can be addressed quite adequately with simultaneous anterior and posterior approaches. The simultaneous anterior and posterior approach is associated with decreases in operating time, blood loss, and hospital stay. Technical advantages of the simultaneous technique include elimination of acute instability between the stages, protection against dislodgment of the graft, and application of the posterior instrumentation under complete visualization of the anterior graft.},

abstract = {This study retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 17 patients with postlaminectomy lumbar instability treated by transpedicular reduction and stabilization. The criteria of instability were defined strictly by both the clinical symptom of "instability catch" and the radiological findings that fulfilled Nachemson's criteria. Low back pain and/or sciatica that interfered largely with the patients' work or quality of life were the indications for this treatment. All the operations were performed by one surgeon with the same spinal instrumentation system-"AO internal fixator". The follow-up period was between 16 and 36 months (mean 24 months). Face to face questionnaire revealed that this treatment modality is encouraging. Fourteen patients (82{\%}) had complete or nearly complete relief from all the pre-operative symptoms. Two (12{\%}) had partial relief of the symptoms that required a subsequent discectomy or wider laminectomy. Only one case (6{\%}) with osteoporosis remained unchanged after the operation. On the follow-up radiographs, sixteen patients (94{\%}) showed good alignment and solid arthrodesis of the treated motion segment. These radiological findings correlated quite well with the absence of the clinical symptom of "instability catch". A common, but acceptable, complication found in this series was a variable degree of low back stiffness secondary to the instrumentation. Fracture of the screw was found in one patient and pull out of the screw was found in another patient. However, they did not elicit detectable symptoms. Osteoporosis, concomitant disc herniation and persistent spinal stenosis at/or adjacent to the operated level were the three main factors that may contribute to unsatisfactory results secondary to this treatment. These problems remain to be resolved in the future.},

The results in the group of burst fracture patients are presented. 35 out of 104 surgically treated patients fulfilled all criteria of the study, 29 of them could be followed-up. After scoring the sporting activity and the performance level, the results showed that sports like table tennis, jogging, soccer, handball and volleyball are often stopped after the surgical treatment. Downhill skiing, swimming, biking and athletics can be continued, even on a higher performance level than before surgery. Sporting activity is an important part of quality of life in the age group from 20 to 40 years.

All patients underwent surgical treatment and were followed for an average of 27 months. All but one patient achieved solid radiographic fusion. Three treatment groups were studied: the first group of 16 patients underwent anterior decompression and fusion with instrumentation; the second group of 27 patients underwent posterior decompression and fusion; and the third group of six patients had combined anterior-posterior surgery. Prior to surgical intervention, these groups were compared and found to be similar in age, gender, level of injury, percentage of canal compromise, neurological function, and kyphosis. Patients treated with posterior surgery had a statistically significant diminution in operative time and blood loss and number of units transfused. There were no significant intergroup differences when considering postoperative kyphotic correction, neurological function, pain assessment, or the ability to return to work. Posterior surgery was found to be as effective as anterior or anterior-posterior surgery when treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Posterior surgery, however, takes the least time, causes the least blood loss, and is the least expensive of the three procedures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Herniated cervical disc specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical discectomy for persistent radiculopathy and cultured in vitro to determine whether various biochemical agents were being produced. OBJECTIVES: Our hypothesis is that biochemical mediators of inflammation and tissue degradation play a role in cervical intervertebral disc degeneration and in the pathophysiology of cervical radiculopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Neck pain with or without radiculopathy is a common clinical problem, but the etiology of neck pain and the exact pathophysiology of radiculopathy remain uncertain. We have previously reported the production of various biochemical agents by herniated lumbar disc specimens in vitro. Because of a lack of such studies in the literature with respect to the cervical spine, the purpose of this study was to determine whether similar biochemical agents of inflammation and tissue degradation were being produced by herniated cervical disc specimens. METHODS: Eighteen herniated cervical discs were obtained from 15 patients undergoing anterior disc surgery. The specimens were cultured and incubated for 72 hours, and the media were subsequently collected for biochemical analysis. Biochemical assays for matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and a variety of cytokines were performed. As a control group, six cervical discs specimens were obtained from three patients undergoing anterior surgery for traumatic burst fractures, and similar biochemical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The culture media from the herniated cervical disc specimens showed increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase activity compared with the control discs. Similarly, the levels of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6 were significantly higher in the herniated disc specimens compared with the control discs. Interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein, and substance P were not detected in the culture media of the herniated or control discs. CONCLUSIONS: Herniated cervical disc specimens were making spontaneously increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6. These results were similar to those obtained in herniated lumbar disc specimens that we have previously reported. These products may be intimately involved in the biochemistry of disc degeneration and the pathophysiology of radiculopathy.},

abstract = {This study investigated the stress distribution in the L1 vertebra under a vertical axial load. Five normal spinal units (T12-L2) were obtained from embalmed human cadavers, to measure the surface strain in the L1 vertebra. Stress screening using a brittle-coat was prepared beforehand, then fourteen sites on the lateral half of the surface on the L1 vertebra were carefully chosen to install rosette strain gauges. A vertical axial load was applied up to 1471 N in two degrees of flexion, in the neutral position, and in two degrees of extension of the intact spine, and in the neutral facetectomized spine. The strain at each site was measured with strain gauges, then the tensile, compressive and shear strain values were calculated. Cracks in the brittle-coat showed the strain concentration in the base of the pedicles and rims on the superior vertebral body. Analysis of the data by strain gauge showed that the amount of strain at the rims on the superior vertebral body was greater than that at the inferior rims in the three positions of the intact spines, with a statistical significance. These strains led to a burst in the superior vertebral body rims. As for the posterior elements, the inner surface of the laminas received a tensile strain only, while the principal strain on the outer surface of the laminas was a compressive strain, in the directions parallel to the laminas. These strains led to a transformation in the posterior elements, leading to widening in the interpedicular distance and a fracture in the inner surface of the lamina. These results showed the first lumbar vertebra was easily mechanically injured by a Denis type B burst fracture. Also this study demonstrated that the pedicles were the pathway for load transmission.},

abstract = {A study of 14 surgically treated patients with low lumbar burst fractures (L3 to  L5) is reported. Initially, 13 patients presented with incomplete neurologic deficits below the level of injury. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 40 months, with an average of 30 months. In group 1, seven patients underwent one-stage anterior decompression, fusion, and Anterior Locking Plate System (ALPS) fixation. In Group 2, seven patients had posterior surgery with decompression, portero-lateral fusion, and a short segment fixation, one above and one below the injuried level, with the reduction-fixation transpediculate system. Indications for one-stage anterior surgery consisted of patients with incomplete neurologic deficits, segmental kyphotic deformity caused by loss of anterior vertebral height ({\textless} 50{\%}), or canal encroachment {\textless} 50{\%}. When there is significant radiologic evidence of lamina fractures, displaced or greenstick type, or injuries that occurred at the L5 level, the posterior approach was undertaken initially. This may be followed by anterior surgery if satisfactory vertebral height restoration or canal clearance was not achieved. Five dura tears (36{\%}) were noted during surgery: two tears in group 1 and three tears in group 2. There were two patients in group 2 (29{\%}) who had screws broken; however, none in group 1 demonstrated implant failure. In the low lumbar region, the step-off ALPS plate is preferable to the straight plate because of the increasing size of the vertebral body toward the caudal area. A low profile and easy application were its advantages. However, the ALPS could not be distracted or compressed anteriorly.},

We believe, however, that neurological damage occurs at the moment of injury when the anatomy is most distorted, and is not due to impingement in the resting positions observed afterwards. We studied 20 consecutive patients admitted to our spinal injuries unit over a two-year period with a T12 or L1 burst fracture. There was no correlation between bony or canal disruption and the degree of neurological compromise sustained but there was a significant correlation between the energy of the injury (as gauged by the Injury Severity Score) and the neurological status (p {\textless} 0.001). This suggests that neurological injury occurs at the time of trauma rather than being a result of pressure from fragments in the canal afterwards and questions the need to operate simply to remove these fragments.},

abstract = {The clinical features of many cases of low back pain is inadequately explained by anatomic abnormalities alone. A pathophysiologic mechanism that includes a combination of mechanical and biochemical factors is an alternative explanation that is accompanied by less paradox than a purely structural paradigm. A potential unifying feature includes inflammation of neural elements caused by the chemical components of the intervertebral disc. There is a historical basis to the concept of an immunologic potential of the lumbar disc. No discrete in situ evidence or discrete mechanism has been previously identified. The recent demonstration of immunohistopathologic evidence of an immunocompetent cellular response at the epidural interface of lumbar HNPs supports the concept of the immunogenic capacity of nucleus pulposus. The identification of high levels of an inflammatory enzyme, phospholipase A2, in lumbar herniated and degenerative discs presents the basis for a direct inflammogenic capability of lumbar discs, separate from a immunologic mechanism. Subsequent experimental findings of conduction block and perineural inflammation as a consequence of extrathecal application of autologous nucleus pulposus and axonal injury after animal nerve injection of the human disc phospholipase A2 further validates this concept. There is a strong theoretic basis to support the concept that the clinical features of many lumbar disc patients may be explained by inflammation caused by biochemical factors alone or combined with mechanical deformation of lumbar tissues, rather than mechanical factors alone.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzed the changes in the load-displacement behavior of lumbar spine segments caused by burst fractures that were experimentally produced in fresh human cadaveric spines. The effect of three transpedicular surgical constructs on stability was investigated in each specimen. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the loss of mechanical stiffness caused by the injury, and to evaluate the stiffness of three transpedicular surgical constructs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although various investigators have studied the biomechanical characteristics of the burst fracture and surgical stabilization techniques, few have reported quantitative data on the three-dimensional biomechanical instability of these fractures. METHODS: Load-displacement data were acquired in flexion, lateral bending, and axial rotation for intact specimens, after the L1 burst fracture was created and after the T12-L2 segments were stabilized using Luque plates, VSP plates, and Isola rods with one transverse connector. RESULTS: Spines with burst fractures showed a bilinear load-displacement behavior with significant instability (loss of stiffness relative to intact) at low loads (up to 3 N.m) in flexion, lateral bending, and axial rotation. The loss of stiffness was greatest in axial rotation over the entire load range (up to 10 N.m). If posterior element injury also was present, a significantly larger loss of stiffness was observed in flexion and axial rotation. The three transpedicular constructs improved the stability of the injured spine beyond that of the intact spine in flexion and lateral bending at low loads. At high loads, they restored the stiffness to intact levels. However, in axial rotation they did not restore the stiffness to pre-injury level, particularly when the posterior column was disrupted. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of the burst fracture returns the spine to its position of greatest inherent instability, essentially requiring the transpedicular instrumentation to be load bearing. To enhance mechanical stability, it may be necessary to augment the transpedicular construct, particularly when the posterior column is disrupted.},

abstract = {Because treatment algorithms for spinal injuries depend largely on the clinical assessment of stability after injury, this study both quantified and compared the mechanical stability after three different patterns of injury in the thoracolumbar spine. We created compression fractures, burst fractures, and flexion-distraction injuries in 26 thoracolumbar specimens from human cadavers in order to compare residual stability as a function of type of injury. Spinal stability was evaluated using measurements of the boundaries of the neutral zone, which provide a measure of spinal laxity in various directions of motion. An increase after injury was indicative of greater spinal laxity and hence reduced residual stability. Geometric characteristics (or parameters) of the neutral zone boundaries were used for statistical comparison between the types of injury. Of the three groups, burst fractures retained the least residual stability and compression fractures, the greatest. The angular ranges of motion in the neutral zone for burst fractures demonstrated increases (compared with average values for intact specimens) of 154{\%} in flexion-extension, 134{\%} in lateral bending, and 108{\%} in torsion after injury. The results for flexion-distraction injuries were similar to those for burst fractures in flexion-extension (126{\%}) and torsion (62{\%}); however, more residual stability was retained in lateral bending than was seen for burst fractures (48{\%}). Compression fractures retained the most residual stability, with increases in motion of 40{\%} in flexion-extension, 56{\%} in lateral bending, and 3{\%} in torsion. These findings may be useful in determining the necessity for surgical stabilization of the spine and selection of the appropriate system of fixation.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study validated the three-column theory of fractures by correlating the multidirectional instabilities and the vertebral injuries to each of the three columns, using a biomechanic trauma model. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to validate the three-column theory as applied to the thoracolumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The widely used three-column theory of fractures for classification and evaluation was based on retrospective analysis of radiographs. No biomechanic study, using realistic spinal fractures and multidirectional instability measurements, was available. METHODS: Using 16 fresh cadaveric thoracolumbar human spine specimens, two groups of burst fractures were produced by either simple axial compression or flexion-compression, using a high-speed trauma model. Multidirectional flexibility was measured before and after the trauma, thus quantifying the instability of the burst fracture. Computed tomography scans were taken after the fracture, and a newly developed injury scoring scheme quantified the injuries to the anterior, middle, and posterior columns. Statistical correlations were obtained between the flexibility parameters and injuries to each of the three columns. RESULTS: In the axial compression group, the middle column injury, compared with the other two columns, showed the highest correlations to eight of the nine flexibility parameters (average R2 = 0.77). In the flexion-compression group, again the middle column injury showed the highest correlations to eight of the nine flexibility parameters (average R2 = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study supported the three-column theory of the thoracolumbar fractures and bolstered the concept of the middle column being the primary determinant of mechanical stability of this region of the spine.},

abstract = {For anatomic reduction of the spinal frectures, the 3 dimensional multiple correction forces were needed. Several pedical screw systems were designed for reducion and fixation of the spinal fractures as the AO universal joint system and the RF angle screw system. Because of the contradiction of the universal joint and the fixed angle, a new generation of RF was designed and named AF (atlas fixator) system. This is a new concept of 3-D reduction, without complex structure as universal joint, but has truly 3-D adjustment that allowed to reduce the intra-canal compromise. It also provided rigid fixation to maintain the reduction. Comparison with CD, AO, Steffee, and RF, the AF was truly 3-D reduction in XTZ axis. It provided strong symmetric transmitter orthotic force to correct the deformity. 31 patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures were treated with the new AF system. 17 had partial (15) or complete (2) neurologic deficits. The AF system provided accurate angle to restore the normal thoracic-lumbar lordosis and to maintain it. All patients had a anatomic reduction by AF system. The spinal canal area increased over 33{\%} by CT scan (P {\textless} 0.01). All cases were followed up over 8 months. No one deteriorated neurologically after AF fixation.},

The fractures were classified as 20 burst, six fracture dislocations, five severe compression fractures, and one gunshot wound. There were 12 multilevel fractures. Nine patients had incomplete neurological injuries and three had complete neurological injuries. The average age was 36.8 years (range 17-63) and the average follow-up was 22.3 months (range 12-60). Fifty three percent (17/32) of these had multisystem injuries including visceral trauma and long extremity fractures. There were only two complications; a deep vein thrombosis and a heel ulcer. Neither of these complications extended the patients' hospital stay. All nine of those with incomplete neurological injuries improved at least one Frankel grade. Fifteen of 24 patients who were employed returned to their previous jobs, and only nine patients had persistent back pain requiring medication. Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures is often favored over conservative treatment in the multitrauma and neurologically injured patient because of complications related to bedrest. However, by using a rotorest bed and aggressive physical therapy, conservative treatment may actually result in lower morbidity.},

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the dynamic canal encroachment during the trauma is greater than the static canal encroachment posttrauma. We successfully produced burst fractures in nine of 15 fresh human cadaveric thoracolumbar spine specimens (T11-L1). The specimens were incrementally impacted in a high-speed trauma apparatus until fracture occurred. During the trauma, dynamic canal encroachments were measured using three specially designed transducers placed in the canal at the levels of the superior end-plates of the T12 and L1 and the T12/L1 disk. After the trauma, residual static spinal canal encroachments were measured from the radiographs of the specimens that were prepared with 1.6-mm diameter steel balls lining the canal in the midsagittal plane. We found that the average canal diameter was 16.6 +/- 1.3 mm and the static canal encroachment was 18.0{\%} of the canal diameter. The corresponding dynamic canal encroachment was 33.3{\%}. Thus, the dynamic canal encroachment was 85{\%} more than the static measurement. The clinical significance of this study lies in providing awareness to the clinician that the dynamic canal encroachment is significantly greater than the static canal encroachment seen on posttrauma radiographs or computed tomography scans. The finding may also explain the clinical observation of poor correlation between the canal encroachment measured radiographically and the neurological deficit.},

New radiographs were obtained and a standardized questionnaire on pain and on functional and economical status was answered. The radiographical analysis included measurement of the vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis and of the sagittal index. The preoperative vertebral kyphosis averaged +17 degrees and was corrected to +7 degrees at follow-up with the sagittal index improving from 0.59 to 0.86. The segmental respectively local kyphosis was reduced from +15 degrees respectively +8 to +5 degrees respectively -3 degrees. The fractured vertebra remained stable. We registered an average postoperative loss of correction of 4 degrees in the upper disc space due to collapse of the injured disc. The lower disc space was frequently overcorrected which was neutralized postoperatively due to a process of reequilibration of less than 3 degrees. The loss of correction occurred both before and after removal of the implant. There was no significant change of the sagittal plane apart from a successful realignment of the flexion-distraction injuries. Five out of 8 patients with neurological symptoms improved by at least 1 Frankel grade. We had no case of neurological deterioration. The results of the questionnaire were good or very good in 70{\%}. At follow-up, the average back pain score was 3 out of 10, 10 being unbearable pain.},

The patients were divided into two groups according to time elapsed between injury and operation. Cases operated on within the first 24 h were taken as the early surgery group (n = 10) and cases operated on later than 24 h after the injury were considered as the late surgery group (n = 8). The efficacy of treatment was assessed by evaluation of the sagittal index (SI) restoration and reduction of canal compromise. The pre- and postoperative values for SI and canal narrowing (CN) for both groups are as follows: Early preoperative SI-23.40 degrees, late preoperative SI-24.50 degrees, p = 0.53; early preoperative CN-0.47, late preoperative CN 0.52, p = 0.33; early postoperative SI-4.20 degrees, late postoperative SI-13.50 degrees, p = 0.0001; early postoperative CN-0.10, late postoperative CN-0.39, p = 0.0000. There is still controversy concerning the relationship between canal narrowing and neurologic deficit, and the effect, if any, of decompression on neural recovery. Nevertheless, if the main aim of the surgical procedure is to restore the SI and decompress the neural canal, then other alternatives of decompression and realignment should be preferred to indirect reduction using short segment transpedicular fixation in cases to be operated on later than 24 h after injury.},

Sixty-three patients with burst fractures at the T11 to L2 vertebral level and associated neurological deficit were evaluated by plain roentgenograms, CT scan and a quantitative neurological examination. The parameters used were percent canal compromise, location of the retropulsed middle column fragment, kyphosis, type of treatment, and neurological recovery. The follow-up varied from 24 to 84 months (mean 44 months). Treatment was conservative in 15 patients and surgical in 48 patients. Posterolateral decompression was carried out in 26 patients. The severity of the initial paralysis did not correlate with the initial fracture pattern except perhaps for Frankel A cases. Neurological recovery did correlate with the initial kyphosis but not with the amount of canal compromise or the location of the middle column fragment. Neurological recovery did not correlate with decompression. Improvement of paralysis was associated with restoration of the sagittal spine alignment. From the patients with greater than 5 degrees correction of kyphosis the majority improved neurologically. If the correction of the kyphosis was less than 5 degrees the recovery was poor regardless of the method used. We assume that the initial paralysis in burst fractures with severe kyphosis is partially caused by permanent cord or root damage and partially by neuroapraxia from angulation of the neural structures and their vessels. With reduction of the fracture and correction of the kyphotic deformity, spinal cord, roots and their vessels become lax, and the chances for neurological recovery increase significantly.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of posterior ligamentous injury that occurs in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and to correlate ligamentous disruption with radiographic appearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations of 21 patients with 25 thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrospectively evaluated to determine spinal ligament integrity. Radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) examinations were evaluated for interpediculate widening, midsagittal canal narrowing, posterior element fractures, and kyphosis; a radiographic assessment of posterior ligamentous integrity was made. These findings were then correlated with the status of the spinal ligaments. RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the status of their supraspinous ligament (SSL). Six patients had disrupted SSLs, and 15 had intact SSLs. Radiographic and CT findings did not correlate with supraspinous ligament disruption. Radiographic indicators of posterior ligamentous disruption were present in only 33{\%} of patients with SSL disruption. CONCLUSION: SSL disruption is a frequent occurrence in patients with burst fractures. No radiographic features of burst fractures correlate with SSL disruption, and radiographic signs of posterior ligamentous disruption are insensitive.},

The purpose of this in vitro study was to correlate three-dimensional flexibility to each fracture type, i.e., endplate, wedge, and burst. Ten fresh cadaveric human spine specimens (T11-L1) were incrementally impacted in a high-speed trauma apparatus until a fracture occurred. All fractures were produced by the same mechanism (axial compression/flexion load). The occurrence of a fracture was monitored by lateral radiographs of the specimen, whose canal was lined with 1.6-mm steel balls. After each impact, the specimen was studied for its flexibility in flexion, extension, left and right lateral bindings, and left and right axial rotations. The flexibility was determined in response to the application of maximum pure moments of 7.5 Nm. Each moment was applied individually and in three load cycles. Parameters of neutral zone (NZ) and range of motion (ROM) were computed. Average flexion-extension ROM (and NZ) for intact, endplate, wedge, and burst fracture were respectively, 12.7 degrees (1.3 degrees), 13.9 degrees (1.7 degrees), 19.2 degrees (3.2 degrees), 22.0 degrees (6.0 degrees). The average lateral bending ROM (NZ) were 12.6 degrees (1.2 degrees), 13.6 degrees (1.9 degrees), 19.1 degrees (3.7 degrees), 27.2 degrees (9.8 degrees). The average axial rotation ROM (NZ) were 4.7 degrees (0.4 degree), 6.1 degrees (0.7 degrees), 7.1 degrees (1.0 degree), 12.9 degrees (3.1 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The 5-lipoxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid, the leukotrienes, are increasingly recognized as major mediators of early glomerular hemodynamic and structural deterioration during experimental glomerulonephritis. Generation of these metabolites is largely by infiltrating leukocytes, but can also occur by intrinsic glomerular cells via transcellular metabolism of intermediates. In several animal models of glomerulonephritis and other renal pathologic states, leukotrienes have been shown to exert adverse effects in the glomerulus. Leukotriene B4 augments neutrophil infiltration, and leukotrienes C4 and D4 mediate potent vasoconstrictor effects on the glomerular microcirculation. Selective blockade of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the course of glomerular injury is associated with a significant amelioration of the deterioration of renal hemodynamic and structural parameters. 15-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-S-HETE), the immediate product of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, and the lipoxins, which are produced by sequential 15- and 5- or 5- and 12-lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid are also generated in the course of glomerular injury. These eicosanoids have actions that contrast with those of leukotrienes. 15-S-HETE antagonizes leukotriene-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and lipoxin A4 antagonizes the effects of leukotrienes C4 and D4 on the glomerular microcirculation. The contrasting effects of 5- and 15-lipoxygenase products may represent endogenous pro- and anti-inflammatory influences that could ultimately regulate the extent and severity of glomerular inflammation. The recent availability of safe and effective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors will be helpful to test the effect of blocking leukotriene production on the course of human glomerulonephritis and other disease states.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of one surgeon's results using three different lumbosacral arthrodesis techniques: Group 1, no instrumentation; Group 2, Luque Rod and sublaminar wire technique; and Group 3, AO intrapedicular screw and plate technique. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of metal implants results in a higher fusion rate. Once a solid arthrodesis is achieved, is this correlated with a good clinical result? SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Controversy persists regarding the value of the use of intrapedicular fixation to augment arthrodesis of the lumbosacral junction. Controversy also exists regarding the correlation of solid arthrodesis with relief of preoperative symptoms. METHODS: Three serial sequential populations (50 subjects each) undergoing varied primary multiple-level lumbosacral arthrodesis procedures were studied retrospectively. The ultimate clinical results of these three different surgical populations were studied after prolonged follow-up. RESULTS: Group one had a 14{\%} fusion rate and a 4{\%} complication rate. Group two had a 36{\%} fusion rate and an 8{\%} complication rate. Group three had a 64{\%} fusion rate and an 18{\%} complication rate. Complications were intraoperative dural tears and nerve root injuries. Patient satisfaction with each operative procedure to relieve preoperative low back pain was statistically correlated with whether a solid arthrodesis was obtained. CONCLUSION: Intrapedicular fixation technique is the most reliable method for obtaining a solid multiple-level lumbosacral arthrodesis. Solid arthrodesis is correlated with a successful clinical result. Complications associated with the use of intrapedicular fixation were frequent but their occurrence demonstrated a "learning curve pattern."},

Sixty percent of patients were braced with a custom molded thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) fitted after surgical stabilization. Minor complications occurred in 45{\%} of the cases (urinary tract infection most common). There was a singular deep wound infection and another iliac crest donor site infection. There were no instrument failures or pseudarthroses. Radiographic analysis showed the following improvements in fracture angle, vertebral body compression, and fracture displacement. The pattern of radiographic improvement in the FD and FC/B subgroups showed significant improvement in each parameter when comparing preoperative to immediate postoperative values. Of importance, the radiographic findings comparing 1 month to the final follow-up showed little to no deterioration. Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation proved to be a highly effective device for immediate restabilization of unstable thoracolumbar injuries.},

abstract = {A retrospective case-control study was undertaken to determine the best technique to measure neural canal encroachment at each lumbar level following burst fracture and its relationship to the presence of neurologic deficit. Only patients with postinjury CT scans demonstrating a disrupted posterior body with a retropulsed bone fragment were included. Patients were divided into groups based on the level of bony injury (T12-L5) and neurologic status. Neurologic injury was classified as follows: normal (N), root (R), or cauda equina/conus/paraplegic/paraparetic (C/P). The mean transverse spinal area (TSA, cm2), spinal canal percentage patency (PP), and midsagittal diameter (MSD) were determined for each neurologic group and lumbar level. A "calculated" TSA, based on midsagittal and anterior-posterior diameters, was also derived for each patient. The data were compared level by level and correlated with the patient's neurologic status. At L1, the critical TSA was 1.0 cm2. All patients with TSAs less than this were paraplegic. At both T12 and L1, TSAs in the range of 1.0-1.25 cm2 were observed in both normal and neurologically impaired patients. A critically significant TSA was not established for levels T12, L2, L3, L4, or L5; however, the data indicated that a smaller TSA can be tolerated at successively caudal levels without neurologic deficit. No meaningful correlation between root injury and TSA was observed. The data also indicated that measurement of TSA is a more accurate method for evaluating neural canal encroachment than PP or MSD. The "calculated" TSA is a simple, objective method for obtaining this information without the aid of a computer. This study suggests that absolute TSA should be utilized in future studies evaluating decompressive treatment of thoracolumbar pathology.},

abstract = {The amount of spinal canal compromise is one of the primary criteria employed to  specify treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Canal compromise has been calculated utilizing measurement of anterior-posterior canal or by calculating the area of the involved spinal canal on CT scans. Since these measurements are critical to surgical decision making, we have compared anterior-posterior measurements with area measurements to assess the variability between these two techniques. Three mm axial CT scans from ten patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were studied. The axial CT images at the midpoints of the vertebral bodies at the levels above and below the fracture level, and the axial CT image demonstrating the most significant canal compromise at the fracture level were digitized using an optical scanner. Using the image 1.43 software, the anterior-posterior dimensions and area dimensions of each axial CT scan were obtained and the amount of canal compromise calculated. Linear measurements consistently overestimate the extent of spinal canal compromise as compared to the true area of canal compromise (6-46{\%}, p {\textless} 0.005). This amount of variation did not correlate with the level, patient age or the extent of canal compromise. This preliminary study suggests that the two measurement techniques used to guide surgical decision making are not comparable. Further evaluation comparing the use of linear and area measurements is warranted.},

The patients were followed for an average of seventy-four months (range, thirty-four to 118 months). Six months after the operation, the rods were removed and the fusion mass was explored. At that time, twelve patients had a solid fusion at all levels of the arthrodesis. Of the eighty-eight facet joints that had been spanned by the rods but had not been included in the arthrodesis, two had nevertheless progressed to fusion, as determined radiographically. Physiological motion was present in forty-three of the forty-four segments for which a fusion had not been intended. Before the operation, the average anterior height of the fractured vertebrae was 61 per cent of the estimated height before the injury; this improved after the operation to an average of 83 per cent (median, 87 per cent) of the height before the injury. At the latest follow-up examination, the anterior height was an average of 78 per cent of the estimated height before the injury (median, 82 per cent; range, 51 to 93 per cent), a slight decrease compared with the value immediately after the operation. Kyphosis of the injured segment before the operation, measured for twelve of the thirteen patients, averaged 15 degrees (median, 12 degrees; range, 0 to 33 degrees); as a result of the operation, this improved an average of 15 degrees, to 0 degrees of kyphosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Compression fractures with anterior wedging of the vertebral body are the most frequent fractures of the thoraco-lumbal spine. As yet, there is no fracture classification that has achieved general clinical acceptance. A classification is presented that defines fractures as A, B, and C types, according to their pathomorphology and mechanical stability. The main types are subdivided into A1-A2, B1-B2 and C1-C2. The A fractures incorporated a compression lesion of the anterior column with minimal or moderate loss of anterior height of the vertebral body. An intact intervertebral disc defines the A1 lesion. With loss of disc function through disc rupture into the fractured body, the vertebral segment is biomechanically destabilized and the lesion is classified as A2. The B-type wedge compression fracture defines a disc and bone lesion of the anterior column with severe wedging combined with a distraction lesion of the posterior column involving mostly ligaments. Not infrequently, the middle column presents with a dorso-cranial wall fragment, which may be dislocated into the spinal but without endangering the cord. Isolated lesions of the anterior and posterior columns are considered B1 lesions. B2 lesions incorporate an additional stable osseous lesion of the middle column. Wedge compression fractures of the C type are mechanically and neurologically unstable three-column lesions producing cord compression by way of dislocated fragments of the dorso-cranial vertebral body, which compromises the spinal canal. C1 fractures are like B fractures in the degree of severity of the anterior and posterior column lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the surgical approaches and the selection of instrumentation to determine indications for using the transpedicular fixation procedure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Various transpedicular fixation devices have been used for different type of injuries, and satisfactory postoperative results were not obtained in some studies. METHODS: Forty patients had burst fractures, 19 had fracture dislocations, and six had chance-type fractures. An anterior decompression procedure was used for most cases of burst fracture and some cases of fracture dislocation where anterior compression factors were present. The Zielke or modified Zielke system was used as an internal fixator for posterior segmental fixation. RESULTS: No patient had neurologic deterioration after surgery. Twenty of 28 patients with incomplete lesions improved postoperatively according to Frankel grades. The instrumentation failed in only one patient, in whom a nonunion developed. CONCLUSION: With transpedicular fixation, it is possible to provide solid internal fixation that is circumscribed to the injured vertebral segments. The elasticity of the Zielke rod makes it an excellent transpedicular fixation device because it is easily attached and reduction is easily performed. Anterior decompression with fusion needs to be used with transpedicular fixation in the treatment of injuries (especially burst fractures).},

METHODS: Patients were evaluated by means of plain radiographs and computed tomography scans according to the classification of Denis for the fracture types. This was compared with a newer classification. Neurologic assessment was according to the Frankel grading system and the motor score index. RESULTS: Ten patients deteriorated by one Frankel grade and two deteriorated by three Frankel grades; the remaining deteriorated, but within the same grade. The motor score index dropped from 33.5 to 26.8. In the Denis classification, the most common injury was a burst fracture, including a significant number of rotational bursts. In the newer classification, those fractures that contained a component of rotation were the most commonly seen. CONCLUSION: When a torsional mechanism has been identified, additional care should be taken in managing patients with spinal fractures because of the risk of further neurologic injury.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The efficacy of posterior instrumentations for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures to restore spinal alignment and indirectly reduce intracanal bone fragments was investigated. Also, a biomechanical study was performed to compare the mechanical stability of anterior and posterior instrumentations. METHODS: Twenty-four fresh human cadaveric thoracolumbar spine segments were used. After clinically identical L1 burst fractures were created, two posterior instrumentations were used to restore spinal alignment: 1) Harrington dual distraction rods with sleeves and 2) AO internal fixator. Radiographs and computed tomography scans were obtained to assess spinal alignment and canal dimensions. Biomechanical testing was performed in axial compression, rotation, and flexion-extension on all constructs, including anterior reconstruction with the Kaneda device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphosis averaged 14 degrees in the injured specimens and was corrected to 1 degree of lordosis after posterior reduction, and vertebral body height was restored to normal in most of the specimens. Reduction rate of canal compromise was 12.3{\%} for Harrington instrumentation and 18.5{\%} for AO internal fixator. Anterior reconstruction with the Kaneda device was more stable than the posterior instrumentation systems in all loading conditions. RESULTS: The posterior reduction and stabilization with posterior instrumentation provided effective restoration of the sagittal alignment. However, the reduction capability of the intracanal bone fragments was distinctly limited. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior reconstruction method permits effective decompression of the spinal canal and offers superior mechanical stability compared with the indirect decompression and stabilization of posterior instrumentation.},

The decrease of the surgical correction, from the initial postoperative radiographs to follow-up, was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.0001).

abstract = {SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although the extent of injury after cervical spine fracture can be visualized by imaging, the deformations that occur in the spinal canal during injury are unknown. STUDY DESIGN: This study compared spinal canal occlusion and axial length changes occurring during a simulated compressive burst fracture with the residual deformations after the injury. METHODS: Canal occlusion was measured from changes in pressure in a flexible tube with fluid flowing through it, placed in the canal space after removal of the cord in cadaver specimens. To measure canal axial length, cables were fixed in C1 and led through the foramen transversarium from C2-T1, then out through the base, where they were connected to the core rods of linearly variable differential transformers (LVDT). Axial compressive burst fractures were created in each of ten cadaveric cervical spine specimens using a drop-weight, while force, distraction, and occlusion were monitored throughout the injury event. Pre- and post-injury radiographs and computed tomography scans compared transient and post-injury spinal canal geometry changes. RESULTS: In all cases, severe compressive injuries were produced. Three had an extension component in addition to compression of the vertebra and retropulsion of bone into the canal. The mean post-injury axial height loss measured from radiographs was only 35{\%} of that measured transiently (3.1 mm post-injury, compared with 8.9 mm measured transiently), indicating significant recovery of axial height after impact. Post-injury and transient height loss were not significantly correlated (r2 = 0.230, P = 0.16) demonstrating that it is not a good measure of the extent of injury. Similarly, mean post injury canal area was 139{\%} of the minimum area measured during impact, indicating recovery of canal space, and post-injury and transient values were not significantly correlated (r2 = 0.272, P = 0.12). Mean post-injury midsagittal diameter was 269{\%} of the minimum transient diameter and showed a weak but significant correlation (r2 = 0.481, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Two potential spinal cord injury-causing mechanisms in axial bursting injuries of the cervical spine are occlusion and shortening of the canal. Post-injury radiographic measurements significantly underestimate the actual transient injury that occurs during impact.},

abstract = {The neurological injury associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures may be due  to the acute trauma event or due to chronic instability. For functional diagnosis and appropriate treatment, knowledge of the altered motion patterns of burst fractures may be helpful. Thirteen human cadaveric spine specimens were impacted at high speed in axial compression, resulting in 10 clinically relevant burst fractures. The specimens were subjected to a three-dimensional flexibility test (flexion, extension, bilateral lateral bending, and bilateral axial torque) before and after trauma. The vertebral motion across the burst fracture was described in terms of the helical axis of motion (HAM), a set of parameters that concisely and completely describes the three-dimensional motion. The vertebral rotations about the HAM increased significantly with burst fracture in all loading directions: flexion 8.1-17.7 degrees, extension 7.2-12.5 degrees, lateral bending 8.5-20.6 degrees (to one side), and axial torque 3.6-12.6 degrees (to one side). The HAM shifted significantly in a posterior direction with burst fracture in flexion (11-mm shift), extension (15-mm shift), and axial torque (11-mm shift). No other significant shifts in the HAM position were observed. The translation along the HAM and the orientation of the HAM did not change significantly with injury in any of the loading directions. The results provide clinically relevant information regarding the optimal treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Specifically, fixation methods for burst fractures must be particularly stiff in lateral bending and axial rotation, the directions of greatest instability.},

The purpose of the study was to obtain objective measures of acute instability of these fractures. Thirteen fresh cadaveric human spine specimens (T11-L1) were subjected to high-speed axial trauma, resulting in burst fractures in 10 specimens. Multidirectional flexibilities were measured when the specimen was intact and after the trauma. The average ranges of motion of the burst fractures, measured as percentages of the corresponding intact values at 7.5 Newton-meters, were 202{\%}, 403{\%}, 266{\%}, and 462{\%} for flexion/extension, axial rotation, lateral bending, and tension/compression, respectively. For the neutral zone motion parameter, the motions of the burst fracture were even greater: 670{\%}, 1650{\%}, 779{\%}, and 650{\%}, respectively. All of the increases were significant (P {\textless} 0.05). The clinical significance of the study lies in its finding of high multidirectional acute instability of the thoracolumbar burst fracture, especially in axial rotation.},

abstract = {Treatment of vertebral fractures by the fixed-angle system of the internal fixator allows fusion over a short area and is the form of treatment now in general use. A bisegmental construction is usual, which means that reduction and relief of the injured vertebral body is achieved indirectly by means of two intact vertebrae immediately adjacent on either side. As a result, both segments stiffen up or are permanently damaged in their function. We report on the possibility of single-segment fixation. The principle is the fusion of the injured segment itself only, i.e., the vertebra actually injured and the vertebra adjacent to the injured segment. Unnecessary fixation of a second healthy segment can thus be avoided. The characteristics of the fracture type in which single-segment stabilization is possible are explained. In a small study of the technique, we used the new AO classification of vertebral fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. The operation technique differs in some details from that applied with a multisegmental internal fixator. For example, the pedicle screws occasionally need to be inserted extremely close to the end-plates if the remaining part of the vertebral body has been destroyed and therefore cannot provide stability. Contraindications are broken pedicles and complete burst fractures of the body. With due consideration for these limitations fractures in all three main groups of the AO classification can, in principle, be stabilized in a single segment. In the years 1988-1990, 14 patients were operated on in this way (12 acute injuries, 2 secondary operations).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Computer-aided planimetry was used to measure the narrowing, and its restoration shortly after instrumentation, or at 15 months. The mean initial reduction of canal area was to 63.7{\%} +/- 18.8{\%} of normal; this was restored to a mean of 95.4{\%} +/- 21.2{\%} of normal when measured either soon after surgery or at 15 months (p {\textless} 0.001 for both groups). There was more improvement in cases assessed later. For fractures from D12 to L3, the mean canal area was restored to 99.4{\%} of normal; but at L4 or L5 the mean restitution was to only 60.9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05). We found no correlation between preoperative loss of area and amount of restoration, or severity of neurological deficit. Nor was there any correlation between the delay before surgery and the improvement achieved. The mechanism of fracture reduction appears to be a combination of distraction ligamentotaxis and forced hyperextension.},

abstract = {Many of the current techniques of internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures use tension band wires to achieve secure fixation, allowing immediate postoperative exercise of the affected limb. In addition, the use of a cancellous lag screw placed from the humeral shaft into the humeral head may have several advantages. In particular, this lag screw does not violate the subacromial space and provides initial stability between the head and shaft, which facilitates placement of the tension band wires. This technique was used in 13 patients whose average age was 71 years (range 54-86). Follow-up averaged 20 months. Eight patients had two-part fractures and five patients had three-part fractures. This technique used a deltopectoral approach with manual impaction of the humeral head and shaft. A 6.5-mm AO screw was used for lag screw fixation in addition to two 18-gauge tension band wires: one placed through the tuberosities and one under the rotator cuff tendons. Passive range of motion of the involved shoulder was begun with the first postoperative week, and active range of motion and strengthening were allowed after the fourth postoperative week. At follow-up patients were evaluated for range of motion, function, pain, and radiographic appearance of the fracture. Average forward flexion was 160 degrees, external rotation was 46 degrees, and internal rotation was to the 10th thoracic vertebra. According to the functional scale proposed by Hawkins, 10 of the 13 patients had achieved a good result. Two of the remaining patients had a fair score, and one had a poor outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The authors' objective was to study the anatomical and functional results of an original construct using the Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This construct is called "Modular construct" or "2 H.S.-1 S.H." fits up two vertebrae above the fracture and a single below. So if the fracture is situated on the L1 level, a supra-laminar hook is set up on each side of T11, and two pedicular screws in T12 (2 H.S.). In the same way, a pedicular screw and an infra-laminar hook are set up on each side of L2 (1.S.H.). Two transverse bars connect together the right and the left rod. This retrospective work is based on the study of 24 patients who had a Thoraco-lumbar burst fracture according to Denis'classification, who were operated on in our Department, and started again to walk without external contention. All the patients had a postero-lateral bone graft. There were no [corrected] anterior arthrodesis performed. The average follow up was 4 years. This series was compared with a concomitant series of miscellaneous constructs realized by the same operators with the C.D. instrumentation. RESULTS: The average regional kyphosis angles went from 16.9 degrees in pre-operative to 3.9 degrees in post-operative, and 8 degrees at the maximum follow up. The average vertebral kyphosis angles went from 18 degrees in pre-operative to 3.8 degrees in post-operative, and 6.3 degrees at the maximum follow up. The miscellaneous constructs had poorer results. There were two severe infections, one early the other late. DISCUSSION: These results compared with the literature show that the 2 H.S.-1 S.H. construct is a competitive one. We think that its mechanical qualities arise from adding systematically hooks at the ends of the construct. These hooks protect the screws during flexion and from pull out constraints.},

Also, postoperatively 15.9{\%} of improvement was obtained in the mean kyphosis angle. The mean compression angle, which was 19.5 degrees preoperatively, was corrected by 12.3 degrees and came to an average of 7.1 degrees postoperatively. In light of these data, it is suggested that the AO Spinal Internal Fixator effectively restores three-dimensional alignment of the spine and provides a rigid fixation.},

To address these issues, 93 consecutive cases of thoracolumbar fractures treated with dorsal instrumentation were reviewed. The neurological status at the time of admission and at a mean of 26 months postinjury was graded according to a modified Frankel scale. By using preoperative radiographs and computed tomography scans, we differentiated between fracture-dislocation lesions, dislocation lesions, flexion-distraction lesions, complete and incomplete burst fractures. Spinal stenosis was classified from grade 0 (no stenosis) to grade 3 ({\textgreater} 66{\%} stenosis). All thoracolumbar fractures were treated with posterior instrumentation, using Dick's fixateur interne and Steffee's VSP plates and screws. During this procedure, laminectomy was performed in 33 patients (35{\%}). In 17 cases (52{\%} of the laminectomies), a surgically treatable lesion (dural tear, trapped nerve root, etc.) was found, especially in patients with a combination of a neurological deficit and a dislocation lesion, a fracture-dislocation lesion or a complete burst fracture with spinal stenosis grade 2 or 3.

abstract = {In view of the current level of knowledge and the numerous treatment possibilities, none of the existing classification systems of thoracic and lumbar injuries is completely satisfactory. As a result of more than a decade of consideration of the subject matter and a review of 1445 consecutive thoracolumbar injuries, a comprehensive classification of thoracic and lumbar injuries is proposed. The classification is primarily based on pathomorphological criteria. Categories are established according to the main mechanism of injury, pathomorphological uniformity, and in consideration of prognostic aspects regarding healing potential. The classification reflects a progressive scale of morphological damage by which the degree of instability is determined. The severity of the injury in terms of instability is expressed by its ranking within the classification system. A simple grid, the 3-3-3 scheme of the AO fracture classification, was used in grouping the injuries. This grid consists of three types: A, B, and C. Every type has three groups, each of which contains three subgroups with specifications. The types have a fundamental injury pattern which is determined by the three most important mechanisms acting on the spine: compression, distraction, and axial torque. Type A (vertebral body compression) focuses on injury patterns of the vertebral body. Type B injuries (anterior and posterior element injuries with distraction) are characterized by transverse disruption either anteriorly or posteriorly. Type C lesions (anterior and posterior element injuries with rotation) describe injury patterns resulting from axial torque. The latter are most often superimposed on either type A or type B lesions. Morphological criteria are predominantly used for further subdivision of the injuries. Severity progresses from type A through type C as well as within the types, groups, and further subdivisions. The 1445 cases were analyzed with regard to the level of the main injury, the frequency of types and groups, and the incidence of neurological deficit. Most injuries occurred around the thoracolumbar junction. The upper and lower end of the thoracolumbar spine and the T10 level were most infrequently injured. Type A fractures were found in 66.1{\%}, type B in 14.5{\%}, and type C in 19.4{\%} of the cases. Stable type A1 fractures accounted for 34.7{\%} of the total. Some injury patterns are typical for certain sections of the thoracolumbar spine and others for age groups. The neurological deficit, ranging from complete paraplegia to a single root lesion, was evaluated in 1212 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The geometric changes of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures under extension and  traction loadings were analyzed using functional radiographs. The injuries were produced in an in vitro high-speed impact model. The changes in nine geometric parameters (three angular and six linear) were analyzed from neutral posture to extension and traction positions. In the extended position, all parameters, except the posterior vertebral height and vertebral diameter, were significantly different from the neutral posture values. Also in extension, the posterior vertebral height, vertebral diameter, and posterior unit height were significantly different from their intact values. In the traction position, all nine geometric parameters changed significantly from the neutral posture, whereas only the vertebral diameter remained significantly different from its intact value. These findings demonstrated the treatment advantages of applying traction force to acute burst fractures in contrast to extension moments. Further, changes in the angular parameters due to motion from neutral to extension posture demonstrated that the acute flexibility of the three-vertebrae segment was contributed almost equally by the upper disc (35{\%}), lower disc (27{\%}), and fractured vertebra (38{\%}).},

The different implant systems used included variable spinal plating (n = 249), Edwards (n = 143), and AO fixateur interne (n = 101). The most common intraoperative problem was unrecognized screw misplacement (5.2{\%}). Fracturing of the pedicle during screw insertion and iatrogenic cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in 4.2{\%} of cases. The postoperative deep infection rate was 4.2{\%}. Transient neuropraxia occurred in 2.4{\%} of cases, and permanent nerve root injury occurred in 2.3{\%} of cases. Previously unreported injury to nerve roots occurred late in the postoperative course in three cases. Screw breakage occurred in 2.9{\%} of cases. All other complications had an incidence of less than 2{\%}. The authors conclude that pedicle screw placement may be associated with significant intraoperative and postoperative complications. This information is of value to surgeons using pedicle implant systems as well as to their patients. Repeat surgery is associated with greater numbers of complications.},

abstract = {The short-rod/two-claw (SRTC) technique of spine instrumentation was recently introduced for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. The use of this technique in 10 patients harboring wedge compression or burst fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine is described. Of three patients treated with the construct placed in a distraction mode, the average follow-up loss of angle (the difference between the immediate postoperative and follow-up midsagittal angle as measured on x-ray films) was 18.3 degrees. Of the seven patients in whom the instrumentation was placed in a compression mode, the average observed loss of angle at follow-up examination was 1.6 degrees. Two patients had a preoperative scoliotic deformity at the fracture site, and both deformities were exaggerated by the placement of the SRTC technique in compression. Although no patient experienced an adverse outcome and all achieved a solid fusion, the application of the SRTC technique of universal spine instrumentation in distraction was associated with an exaggerated loss of angle. Loss of angle and deformity exaggeration are not desirable and are preventable by strict patient selection and by applying the construct in a compression mode. It is emphasized that few patients are candidates for this form of instrumentation. When applicable, however, the advantages of decreased pain and stiffness and the elimination of the need for instrumentation removal make the SRTC and related short-segment techniques desirable alternatives to traditional methods of spinal fixation.},

Exclusion was based on single-column compression or chance fractures, neurologic compromise, and nontraumatic fractures. The patient groups had distinctly different fracture patterns based on degree of anterior column compression (ACC). Trends toward significant differences in kyphotic angulation and canal compromise were noted. There were no preoperative complications. Varying modes of external immobilization were used in both groups. One patient in each group used narcotic medications for pain at final follow-up evaluation. When comparing the operatively and nonoperatively treated lumbar burst fracture patients in this study group, no significant difference in treatment outcome was established.

Eleven motion-segments of thoracolumbar spines from human cadavers and 5 ones from calf thoracolumbar spines were compressed vertically until a fracture occurred. Typical burst fracture occurred in seven of eleven human specimens and in all calves spines, which showed destruction of the middle end-plate and disc materials in the vertebral body. The fracture line was located between the middle of the end-plate and the middle of the posterior wall cortex. No burst fractures could be seen in the specimens with severely degenerated disc and osteoporosis. Finite element analysis corresponded to the results of experimental study. Therefore, the axial compression proved to induce typical burst fractures in the thoracolumbar spines. Mechanism of this fracture was influenced by bone mineral density and disc degeneration.},

The majority of injuries were caused by road traffic accidents, followed by falls from a height, and train accidents. More than 50 per cent had associated injuries, of which four were missed; 50 per cent had neurological deficits, and the majority of these cases had burst fractures and fracture-dislocations. Treatment was non-operative in the majority of cases, with only four cases undergoing anterior spinal decompression and fusion, and one had posterior instrumentation and fusion. At follow-up (1-3 years), only one patient, a child, had significant deformity. All patients with partial neurological deficit improved, whereas none of those with complete neurological lesions recovered. Five patients had significant back pain requiring analgesics but not significant enough to interfere with their activities. We concluded that most of these injuries are stable and should be treated non-operatively. Surgery is only indicated in cases with partial neurological deficit and significant spinal canal compromise or significant instability.

abstract = {There continues to be considerable controversy regarding the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Most feel that failure of the middle osteoligamentous complex, particularly with retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal, is an indication for operative management. Others advocate postural reduction and prolonged bedrest for such injuries. The purpose of this study was to 1) review the clinical outcome and efficacy of closed management of thoracolumbar burst fractures; and 2) quantify what, if any, remodeling occurs in the bony canal as measured by serial CT. Forty-one patients who presented with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine without neurologic deficit were reviewed clinically and radiographically following nonoperative management. At injury, canal compromise averaged 37{\%} (range, 16-66{\%}); 26 patients had at least 30{\%} canal compromise. During treatment, one patient developed neurologic deterioration that prompted surgery; all other patients remained neurologically intact. At average follow-up of 2 years, an overall outcome evaluation indicated that 49{\%} of the patients had excellent outcomes relative to pain and function; 17{\%}, good; 22{\%}, fair; and 12{\%}, poor. Approximately 90{\%} of the patients had a satisfactory work status relative to factors associated with their burst fracture. Serial roentgenograms documented significant progression in body collapse, which averaged 8{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001) from injury to follow-up. On the other hand, serial CTs documented significant improvement from injury to follow-up for canal compromise and midsagittal diameter. Average improvements in canal compromise and midsagittal diameter were 22{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 11{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001), respectively. Only three patients had canal compromise greater than 30{\%}, no patients had canal compromise greater than 40{\%}, and no patients experienced canal area deterioration over time. On average, nearly two-thirds of the fragment occluding the canal resorbed, with most remodeling complete within one year. For patients with burst fractures presenting neurologically intact, we obtained the following findings: 1) nonoperative management yields acceptable results; 2) following nonoperative management, bony deformity (i.e., kyphosis and body collapse) progresses marginally relative to the rate of canal area remodeling; 3) incidence of subsequent neurologic deficits is quite low; and 4) initial radiographic severity of injury or residual deformity following closed management does not correlate with symptoms at follow-up. This pattern of results suggests nonoperative management as the preferred treatment in these circumstances.},

abstract = {Twenty-one burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction were stabilized with a transpedicular fixator by surgeons experienced in this technique. Screws 5 or 6 mm in diameter were used. After the removal of the device 1 year postsurgery, axial CT scans were obtained of the instrumented vertebrae. Eighty-two pedicles were examined. In 16 pedicles, medial or lateral cortical defects were found. Five screws had intruded into the spinal canal by a maximum of 3.5 mm. In 48 pedicles a correlative comparison with the preoperative examinations was possible. Compared with the dimensions of the pedicles on the preoperative CT scans, 31 had increased in width, and 14 showed deformation indicative of fractures of the lateral pedicle wall. When the screw diameter exceeded 65{\%} of the pedicles' outer diameter, 85{\%} of the pedicles expanded. One of four screws had penetrated the anterior wall of the vertebra. Pedicle screw penetration on the left side above L2 poses potential risk of erosion of the aorta. The use of pedicle screws at the thoracolumbar junction by experienced surgeons carries some risk for malplacement and neurological damage. Mismatch between pedicle dimension and screw size results in pedicle expansion and lateral wall fractures, probably during screw insertion. Preoperative CT examinations should be used to help in choosing appropriate screw diameter presurgery.},

abstract = {The biomechanics of indirect reduction of bone fragments retropulsed into the spinal canal in a burst fracture were investigated. In this model, tunnels were created in vertebrae L1 and C5 oriented anterior-to-posterior, allowing access to the posterior longitudinal ligament. A probe containing a load-sensing tip was passed through the tunnel. Both the location of the tip and the load acting on it by posterior deflection of the posterior longitudinal ligament were measured. In the lumbar spine, distraction was applied by spinal instrumentation that also permitted independent kyphotic-lordotic alignment of the vertebrae. In the cervical spine, axial traction was applied through direct loading. Several clinically relevant observations were made. It was not possible to produce an anteriorly directed force in the posterior longitudinal ligament at less than 35{\%} canal occlusion, partly because the posterior longitudinal ligament stands away from the midbody of the vertebra. Distractive forces of up to 150 N were applied in the lumbar spine, which were nearly equal to the tensile breaking strength of the isolated posterior longitudinal ligament. Regardless of the relative sagittal plane angulation of the vertebrae, distraction was the governing factor in generating force in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Because positioning the vertebrae in lordosis before applying distraction significantly slackens the posterior longitudinal ligament, it is suggested that distraction be applied before angular positioning of the vertebrae is performed.},

abstract = {The adequate reduction of vertebral burst fractures is dependent on successful application of distractive forces in combination with the restoration of normal spinal lordosis. However, the optimal sequence of distraction in comparison to distraction plus lordosis in the anatomic restoration of the fractured thoracolumbar spine has not been described. Burst fractures of the L1 vertebra were first created and the reduced in vitro using three differing reduction techniques. In six fresh human cadaver spine specimens, the mean fracture severity based on the degree of canal compromise was 31{\%} (SD +/- 20{\%}) after fracture. Reductions were performed using the AO Fixator Intern, the Reduction Fixation (RF) Device, and the Steffee plate systems following standard clinical techniques. The AO Fixator Intern provided independent but variable control of distraction and lordosis, the RF device provided variable distraction with independent, but preset, correction of lordosis and the Steffee system provided set distraction and stabilization. Both the AO and RF devices restored the lordosis (7.6 degrees +/- 5.2 degrees and 9.7 degrees +/- 4.5 degrees, respectively) better than the Steffee plate system (0 degrees +/- 1.6 degrees). However, the AO device provided poorest restoration of the posterior vertebral body height (92{\%} vs 96{\%} for the RF device and 99{\%} for the Steffee plate). The RF device, which restored both lordosis and posterior vertebral body height to the near anatomic prefracture level, provided significantly better canal clearance (9{\%} +/- 8{\%}) than the other techniques, P {\textless} 0.05. The study demonstrates that instrumentation systems that provide independent correction of distraction and lordosis can best restore anatomic alignment, with indirect neurodecompression of the compromised spinal canal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The three-dimensional stability provided by three spinal fixation devices of the  type "fixateur interne" have been studied in an in vitro model using L2-L4 sections of the lumbar spine. Three-dimensional rotations and translations for the intact and instrumented spine under physiological loads in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation were determined. To objectify the results, a dimensionless related stability parameter was introduced. The tested devices were: Dick (AO-Synthes), Kluger (Endotec), and SOCON (Aesculap). In addition a vertebrectomy L3 was performed to simulate a severe fracture model. Different screw diameters allowed for a direct comparison of two internal fixateur systems on identical specimens. In contrast to the intact spine, the instrumented spine reflects purely linear structural behaviour with a stabilization significant in flexion/extension and lateral bending and only moderate in axial rotation. Differences for various systems tested were found to be small. The results for the fracture model confirmed the efficiency of these internal fixation devices.},

abstract = {Standard 5-mm AO Schanz pedicle screws were biomechanically compared with a new design, featuring 6-mm threads with a 5-mm core diameter continuous with the shaft. One each of the two screw designs was surgically inserted into the matching pedicles of 32 cadaveric vertebrae. The pull-out strengths of the screws were then determined by recording the peak force values during extraction under servohydraulic displacement control. The screws were also tested in three-point bending, varying the inner load point with respect to the shaft thread junction, within a clinically anticipated range. The mean pull-out strength for the 6-mm screw was 597 N, which was significantly greater than the mean strength of 405 N for the 5 mm screw (p = 0.002). The 6-mm screw was also stronger in three-point bending, and failed at the point of inner load application, with no evidence of a stress-raising effect at the shaft/thread junction. In contrast, the 5-mm screw withstood lower loads, and failed at the shaft/thread junction, regardless of the point of loading. Pedicle screw breakage and pull-out are the recognized modes of failure of spinal implants, which are dependent on pedicle screw fixation. The results suggest distinct biomechanical advantages for the 6-mm screw, which should be used whenever clinically feasible.},

The special design of angle pedicle screw provided accurate angle to restore the normal thoracic lumbar lordosis and to maintain it. The three-column spine in a lordotic position maximized the reduction and indirectly achieved a neurologic decompression in the spinal canal. All patients had an anatomical reduction by RF system except one case operated two weeks after injury, the spinal canal area increased over 30{\%} by CT (P {\textless} 0.01). Except four cases with Frankle A out of twenty patients with neurologic deficits, all other patients had at least one grade progress. Of them one improved from A to D, ten from C and D to normal. These twenty patients were followed-up over six months. All of them maintained anatomical reduction by RF system. Bone grafting had successful fusion by follow-up X-ray examinations. There were no important complications after surgery. The system is of simple structure facilitation implantation and enable the patients beginning ambulatory movements early, therefore it gives more satisfactory results over conventional Harrington and other segmental spinal instrumentation systems.},

Preoperatively, 12 patients had partial neurologic deficits; postoperatively, 11 improved at least 1 Frankel grade. Preoperatively, the 12 patients with partial neurologic deficits averaged 45 points (range 24-49) on the lower extremity motor index scale. After surgery, these patients improved an average of five points (range 1-23) on the motor index scale. Both patients with complete spinal cord injuries remained unchanged neurologically postoperatively; no patients deteriorated neurologically after surgery.

Sixty-nine (44 neurologic and 25 orthopedic) surgeons responded to the questionnaire. Of those who responded, 97{\%} of the neurologic surgeons and 95{\%} of the orthopedic surgeons stated that they used plain radiography and computed tomography in their pretreatment investigations, and at least 50{\%} in each specialty repeated these investigations at follow-up examinations. Standard tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and myelography were used less frequently both before and after surgery. There were no significant differences between specialties in the use of tests. Neurologic status and the treating surgeon's specialty were found to significantly influence management of burst fractures. According to 56{\%} of neurologic surgeons and 81{\%} of orthopedic surgeons, neurologically intact patients were usually treated with stabilization only (p less than 0.05). The greater number of neurosurgeons who used direct decompression was balanced by the number of orthopedic surgeons who used indirect decompression. Patients with partial, stable neurologic injuries were usually managed by direct decompression and stabilization according to 84{\%} of the responding neurologic surgeons and 77{\%} of the responding orthopedic surgeons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

When the enzyme was treated with parabromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB) to specifically alkylate the active site histidine and block catalytic activity, the ability of the modified protein to produce edema was markedly reduced. Careful regulation of the activity of this enzyme is important in vivo because its inflammatory potential could result in disc degeneration and nerve injury.},

abstract = {In order to clarify the pathomechanism of thoracolumbar burst fractures and to evaluate the influence of disc degeneration and bone mineral density, a biomechanical study was performed using cadaveric spines. Eleven motion segments of thoracolumbar spines from human cadavers were compressed vertically until a fracture occurred. In addition, bone mineral density and degree of disc degeneration were determined for each specimen. Compression of 7 of 11 specimens resulted in the typical burst fracture characterized by retropulsion of a bony fragment into the spinal canal and an increase of the interpedicular distance. All seven specimens showed disruptions of the middle end plate and disc materials in the vertebral body. The fracture line was located between the middle of the end plate and the middle of the posterior wall cortex. No burst fractures were seen in the specimens with severely degenerated discs and osteoporosis. In order to confirm the stress state in a vertebra that induces the burst fracture, finite element analysis of one motion segment was also carried out under the same mechanical conditions as the experiments in this study. As a result of calculation for the healthy disc, the highest stresses under axial compression were concentrated in the following areas: the middle of the end plate, the cancellous bone under the nucleus pulposus, and the middle of the posterior wall cortex. This implies that the above regions are more vulnerable to vertical compressive load. In the analysis of specimens with severely degenerated discs, stresses were very low at the end plate and cancellous bone under the nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Persistent back pain was found to be more disabling in the surgically treated group, in which a fusion incorporating four or five lumbar segments was performed. There was no evidence of significant loss of initial reduction, and no patients experienced late neurological compromise in the surgical group. An average follow-up kyphosis of 9.2 degrees and 31{\%} loss of vertebral height were observed in the conservative group, while a follow-up lordosis of 1 degree and 19{\%} loss of vertebral height were observed in the surgical group. Conservative treatment of low lumbar burst fracture is a viable option in neurologically intact patients, but loss of lordosis and vertebral height may persist. Biomechanical and anatomic characteristics of the low lumbar spine differ from the thoracolumbar region and may account for the inherent stability of these injuries. If surgery is chosen, a long fusion with distraction instrumentation should be avoided in the low lumbar spine. A short rigid fixation with pedicular instrumentation may be of greater benefit.},

abstract = {The authors evaluate the results of surgery of fresh injuries of the thoracolumbar spine achieved by transpedicular fixation, using ridged plates. At the orthopaedic clinic in Brno-Bohunice this technique was systematically introduced in 1989; in 1991 they started to use a better principle of stabilization by an internal fixation device. The authors used plates fixed in a transpedicular way in 58 injured subjects. Most frequently fractures of L1, T12 and L2 were involved, usually of a burst type. In more than half the patients they recorded a nervous deficit of varying degree. They stabilized usually typically four mobile segments and fused two internal ones. In 44 patients manual realignment before operation and during its course were used. After reduction of the vertebral body by reposition of the adjacent surfaces they added spongioplasty. In 3/4 they decompressed nervous structures. In more than 1/3 they supplemented the operation by intersomatic fusion. Stabilization was enhanced by translaminar fusion of intervertebral joints. The results of treatment were evaluated in 54 patients; 38 patients were checked for more than two years after operation. A positive neurological finding after operation did not change in 15 patients, in 13 it improved and in one it deteriorated. In 1/4 the screws cracked, usually caudal ones, in two operated patients a pseudoarthrosis was repaired. In 38 patients checked for a minimum period of 2 years after operation two are confined to a wheelchair, two walk with two French crutches, three with one, 31 without support. Impaired voiding is reported by 18 patients, impaired sexual function by four. Sixteen patients resumed their original occupation, 22 operated patients have invalid pensions.

Persistent complaints of back pain seemed to be found more in patients with long instrumentation and fusion and in patients with loss of lordosis. Conservative treatment of low lumbar burst fractures with body cast is a viable option in the neurologically intact patients with minimal height loss and minor angulation. If surgery is chosen, short rigid instrumentation (eg, transpedicular device) is best in accomplishing shorter fusion, maintaining vertebral height, and restoring lumbar lordosis. Harrington distraction rods improve vertebral height but produce loss of lumbar lordosis. Luque rods do not restore vertebral height and are only moderately effective in restoring lumbar lordosis. If patients are neurologically impaired in association with low lumbar burst fractures, posterior decompression by laminotomy or a transpedicular approach is generally effective. Maintaining vertebral height and restoring lumbar lordosis may be important in the prevention of disability from back pain.},

These three pedicular screw devices were applied to the specimens following the use of standard clinical technique for each device.

The RF device provided pre-set fixed incremental lordosis, while the AO provided variable angular correction.

Results demonstrated that the symmetric lordotic distraction of the disc space and vertebral body provided by the RF device achieved the best possible reduction of the intracanal fragment and sagittal alignment.},

Spinal canal stenosis was reduced from a preoperative mean of 65{\%} to 32.8{\%} postoperatively. Denis type A fractures had significantly better reduction of 62.5{\%} pre- to 19.2{\%} postoperatively. Denis type B fractures reduced from 66.3{\%} pre- to 38.9{\%} postoperatively. The initial kyphotic deformity and the loss of vertebral height did not influence results of indirect decompression. Neurologic function at follow-up correlated with preoperative canal stenosis, but did not correlate with residual stenosis after instrumentation. This study demonstrated that posterior distraction instrumentation can achieve approximately 50{\%} reduction in canal stenosis and that results will be influenced by fracture morphology.},

abstract = {A prospective investigation of internal fixation of acute thoracic and lumbar spine fractures using pedicle screws and dynamic compression plates was performed. This article details the results of 23 patients who were followed for an average of 20 months. The indications for the procedure were an unstable fracture--dislocation below the eighth thoracic vertebra or low lumbar fractures that would be difficult to treat with conventional spinal implants. The patients were divided into three groups based on the fracture pattern and the level of the fracture. Group I consisted of fracture--dislocation injuries at the thoracic level and thoracolumbar junction. Group II patients sustained lumbar fracture--dislocations, and Group III contained lumbar burst fractures. Sagittal and coronal angles as well as anterior and posterior vertebral body height were measured at the injury level preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3-month intervals. Statistical analysis of these angles demonstrated that Group I and III patients had significant correction of their relative kyphotic deformity after surgery; however, there were no differences in kyphotic angle at the 3-month interval. Despite this eventual return to preoperative angles, all patients except one developed solid fusion. There was no increase in neurologic deficit. One patient developed an asymptomatic pseudarthrosis demonstrated by breakage of both plates through unfilled screw holes at the motion segment. Other complications included one wound infection, one case of arachnoiditis after an intradural bone fragment was excised, and one dural tear created by a Kirschner wire, which did not result in a neurologic deficit or a cerebrospinal fluid leak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The selection of surgical approach for patients suffering from acute thoracolumbar spinal trauma is presently imbued with great controversy. The surgical method chosen depends on the type of fracture, anatomic and biomechanical factors, and the habits and experience of the surgeon involved. Due to new techniques for the posterior approach and the use of internal fixators, the indications for the anterior approach must be reassessed. The primary indication for anterior decompression and grafting is narrowing of the spinal canal with neurologic deficits that cannot be resolved by any other approach. Additional indications are seen in patients with vertebral body fractures with complete comminution and dislocation, noncorrectable burst fractures, and late misalignments. After removal of vertebral body and intervertebral disc fragments, autogenous bone should preferably be used for interposition. Different plates can be used for instrumentation. While anterior plates most often offer complete stability for the thoracic spine and a dorsal plating in this region can turn out to be quite difficult, in the lumbar spine, especially with destruction of additional posterior structures, one must think of subsequent surgical intervention for increased stability and compressive posterior fusion with short-armed internal fixators. So far, we have gained experience from treating 39 patients with anterior decompression and stabilization. One of 19 patients with Frankel Grades A and B and 50{\%} of the remaining 20 patients had improved one Frankel grade. Only a few of the patients with incomplete neurologic symptoms had back pain. All except for one returned to work. According to radiologic examinations, the average loss of correction amounted to 7{\%}.},

In 40 of these patients with a burst fracture, the degree of involvement of the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal, as revealed on first CT after admission, was not correlated with the type and degree of initial neurological deficit. In patients with injuries of the lumbar spine, neurological deficit may be mild, although the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal may be reduced by as much as 90{\%}. We cannot establish a difference in neurological recovery between those cases who were managed conservatively and those in whom a surgical decompression and stabilization procedure was performed. Surgical stabilizing procedures, however, result in immediate stabilization of the spine, they diminish pain, facilitate nursing care and allow more rapid mobilization and earlier active rehabilitation. If major extraspinal injuries form a relative contra-indication to surgical decompression of the cord and stabilization of the spine injury, the patient can quite well be treated conservatively without endangering neurological recovery.},

abstract = {Although the benefit of spinal canal decompression of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is controversial, it remains a desirable procedure, as many reports describe improved neurologic outcome with spinal canal reconstruction. The optimal type of posterior instrumentation for reconstructing the spinal canal is unclear. This study focused on the efficacy of posterior distraction rods versus transpedicular screw fixation implants in decompressing the spinal canal and on the relationship between the amount of canal decompression and subsequent neurologic recovery. A medical records review was conducted to identify all patients surgically treated for traumatic burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine from January 1, 1987 to June 30, 1989. Sixty-seven patients were selected by this review, and, of these, 30 had had both preoperative and postoperative CT scans. We could find no bias among patients who received both preoperative and postoperative CT scans as compared to those who did not, therefore the 30 patients were considered to be a random sample of the total population of 67. A retrospective study was then conducted on the 30 patients with surgically treated burst fractures--15 treated with posterior distraction rods and 15 treated with AO Fixator Interne transpedicular screw fixation implants. Preoperative and postoperative spinal canal cross-sectional areas were measured directly from the scaled CT scans. The area of most severe compromise was compared with an internal standard defined as the next, caudal, uncompromised spinal level, and the percentage of preoperative and postoperative canal compromise was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

A prospective study was devised in 1986 for burst fracture treatment. Complete data were available on 35 patients (22 males, 13 females), with an average follow-up of 27 months. SI was greater than 15 degrees in the first group, the members of which were treated surgically. The technique is described. SI was less than 15 degrees in the third group, the members of which were treated conservatively. The second control group included patients with SI greater than 15 degrees but who were not treated according to the authors protocol for independent reasons.

abstract = {Inflammation of neural elements is frequently mentioned clinically in association with lumbar radiculopathy. Mechanical embarrassment of neural elements by definable structural abnormalities is inadequate as a sole explanation of nerve injury in this condition. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether an enzymatic marker for inflammation (phospholipase A2) could be identified in human disc samples removed at surgery for radiculopathy due to lumbar disc disease. Samples were assayed for phospholipase A2 activity. The level of activity in the disc samples was compared with values obtained from other human tissues using the same assay. Specific activity (percent hydrolysis radiolabelled substrate) ranged from 238 to 1,014.5 nmol/min/mg. Mean activity for the human disc material was 568.7 nmol/min/mg, compared with 0.006 nmol/min/mg for human PMN, and 12.1 nmol/min/mg for inflammatory human synovial effusion. The pH and cation-related activity were identical to those demonstrated for phospholipase A2 inflammatory conditions. Human lumbar disc phospholipase A2 activity is from 20- to 100,000-fold more active than any other phospholipase A2 that has been described. As the enzyme responsible for the liberation of arachidonic acid from cell membranes, phospholipase A2 is the rate-limiting step in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These data establish biochemical evidence of inflammation at the site of lumbar disc herniations.},

abstract = {A biomechanical study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Fixateur Interne pedicle screw system and the Syracuse I-Plate anterior fixation system. A total of 12 fresh frozen cadaver spines were tested intact, after burst fracture was created and application of a fixation device (six each), and after six serial transections of posterior ligaments and bony structures. Spines were loaded to a maximum of 10 N-m in flexion, extension, left and right lateral bending, and clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. Results indicate that both systems reduce spinal flexibility in flexion, extension, and lateral bend loading when used to reduce and fix a classic burst fracture without posterior disruption. No decrease in flexibility was found in axial rotation for either device. After transection of all posterior elements, the I-Plate construct became much more flexible than the intact spine in flexion, extension, and axial rotation loading. The internal fixator construct retained more stability than the I-Plate construct after transection of posterior elements in flexion and extension loading, but was considerably more flexible than the intact spine in axial rotation loading. The results imply that the posterior internal fixator provides much better stabilization than the anterior I-Plate for those cases in which there is a large amount of posterior disruption in addition to an anterior burst injury. Neither device provides extensive support in axial rotation loading.},

abstract = {Twenty-one patients with unstable burst fractures of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine were treated with a combined spinal rod-plate and transpedicular screws (CSRP-TPS) fixation system. This system is a new device for disorders of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. In treatment of spinal fractures, it provided three-column axial distraction and stabilized the injured vertebra in a lordotic position-this maximized the reduction and indirectly achieved a neurologic decompression by ligamentotaxis. This "indirect" neurologic decompression was more successful in cases treated early after injury as the spinal canal area (measured by pre- and postoperative CT) increased 35{\%} in cases treated within one week after injury; 25{\%} in cases treated 7-14 days after injury; and there was little improvement in cases treated more than two weeks following injury. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. There were no infections, iatrogenic neurologic deficits or instrumentation failures. The CSRP-TPS system gave more improved results over conventional Harrington and segmental spinal instrumentation systems and only required fixation and fusion of three vertebral levels.},

Serious Denis B or D fractures showed signs of pronounced instability, and all had a large bone fragment rotated into the spinal canal. The neural tissues were compressed in two cases and transected in one. The Denis A fractures had relatively well-restored ligamentous structures and the bone fragment in the spinal canal was narrowing the spinal canal less than 50{\%} in all cases. Three of four had normal neural tissue macroscopically and microscopically. The majority of the patients with chronic burst fractures did not show any sign of bone fragment resorption. Six out of eight patients with thoracolumbar (T12 and L1) and lumbar (L3) fractures experienced intractable burning pain and/or rhizopathy. The pain seemed to be caused by entrapment of the nerve roots in adhesions.},

We retrospectively reviewed our series of thoracolumbar burst fractures to assess the predictive value of CT for the presence of a DL, and the clinical significance of this finding. Twenty-five patients with 27 levels of injury were assessed. Dural lacerations were noted in eight (32{\%}) of the cases. These were significantly associated with posterior element fractures noted on axial CT, and with motor neurologic deficits. There was no correlation between the presence of a DL and the degree of spinal canal compromise. Dural lacerations occur relatively frequently in patients with thoracolumbar fractures that require operative management. Their presence should be of particular concern in those cases with a motor deficit on presentation and a posterior element fracture on axial CT scan.},

Three injuries, combining elements of a burst fracture and a dislocation, were designated "burst-dislocations." Apart from compression fractures, a direct blow was often the implicated mechanism of injury. Significant associated injuries were uncommon. Fracture-dislocations were often associated with neurologic injury and compression fractures with long-term pain. Operative treatment appeared to afford the best results for stabilization and pain relief.},

abstract = {Metastatic involvement can disrupt the mechanical integrity of the spine, rendering vertebrae susceptible to burst fracture and neurologic damage. Fracture risk assessment for patients with spinal metastases is important in considering prophylactic treatment options. Stability of thoracic vertebrae affected by metastatic disease has been shown to be dependent on tumor size and bone density, but additional structural and geometric factors may also play a role in fracture risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use parametric finite element modeling to determine the effects of vertebral level, geometry, and metastatic compromise to the cortical shell on the risk of burst fracture in the thoracic spine. Analysis of vertebral level and geometry was assessed by investigation of seven scenarios ranging in geometry from T2-T4 to T10-T12. The effects of cortical shell compromised were assessed by comparison of four transcortical scenarios to a fully contained central vertebral body tumor scenario. Results demonstrated that upper thoracic vertebrae are at greater risk of burst fracture and that kyphotic motion segments are at decreased risk of burst fracture. Vertebrae with transcortical lesions are up to 30{\%} less likely to lead to burst fracture initiation. The findings of this study are important for improving the understanding of burst fracture mechanics in metastatically involved vertebrae and guiding future modeling efforts.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study and review of literature. OBJECTIVES: Study of  demographic data concerning spinal fractures caused by horse riding, classification of fractures according to the AO and Load Sharing classifications, evaluation of mid-term radiological results and long-term functional results. METHODS: A review of medical reports and radiological examinations of patients presented to our hospital with horse riding-related spine fractures over a 13-year period; long-term functional follow-up is performed using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24). RESULTS: Thirty-six spine fractures were found in 32 patients. Male to female ratio is 1:7. Average age is 33.7 years (8-58 years). The majority of the fractures (78{\%}) are seen at the thoracolumbar junction Th11-L2. All but two patients have AO type A fractures. The average Load Sharing Classification score is 4.9 (range 3-9). Neurological examinations show ASIA/Frankel E status for all patients. Surgical treatment is performed on ten patients. Mean follow-up for radiological data is 15 months (range 3-63). Functional follow-up times range from 1 to 13 years with an average follow-up of 7.3 years. Mean RMDQ-24 score for all patients is 5.5 (range: 0-19), with significantly different scores for the non-operative and surgical group: 4.6 vs 8.1. Twenty-two percent of the patients have permanent occupational disabilities and there is a significant correlation between occupational disability and RMDQ-24 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Not only are short-term effects of spine fractures caused by horse riding substantial but these injuries can also lead to long-term disabilities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the validity of an electrothermal bipolar tissue sealing  system (LigaSure, Valleylab Inc., USA) in lung surgery. METHODS: Our study was divided into two phases. EXPERIMENTAL: We performed sutures of pulmonary vessels and bronchi and lung wedge resections by LigaSure in 28 lungs of adult pigs; subsequently, we quantitated the sealing capacity of the system detecting the burst pressure for each anatomical structure. Clinical: LigaSure was used in 36 patients undergoing lung surgery. We performed 23 thoracotomic procedures in 16 patients (19 wedge resections, 2 segmentectomies, and 2 fissure separations), and 20 thoracoscopic procedures (13 wedge resections, 5 bullectomies, and 2 adherence dissections). RESULTS: EXPERIMENTAL: Bronchi and vessels were divided into seven groups (diameter: 1-7 mm); 10 burst pressure measurements for each group were performed. A total of 84 wedge resections were performed; lung specimens were divided into seven groups (weight: 0.2-1.4 g). The percentage of bronchial sutures resistant to the pneumatic critical pressure (60 mmHg) was 100{\%} in the 1-mm and 2-mm groups. No bronchi with 6-mm or 7-mm diameter reached the critical pressure. All pulmonary vessel sutures were resistant to the critical hydrostatic pressure (150 mmHg). The average burst pressure of wedge resection margins was higher than the critical pressure, and the percentage of suture margins resistant to the critical pressure decreased from 95{\%} (0.2-g group) to 68{\%} (1.4-g group). Histology confirmed the sealing of vessels, with a mean depth of thermal injury limited to 1.1mm. Clinical: In all patients, hemostasis obtained by LigaSure was effective, with minimal perioperative bleeding. The mean operating time was 77.2 min (range: 60-97) for thoracotomies and 60.3 min (range: 46-80) for thoracoscopies. The mean drainage duration was 3.1 days (range: 1-8). Two patients had prolonged air leaks ({\textgreater}7 days). The mean postoperative stay was 7.3 days (range: 5-13) for thoracotomies and 4.6 days (range: 1-6) for thoracoscopies. CONCLUSIONS: Use of LigaSure in lung surgery appears feasible and easy. It provides satisfactory hemostasis and air-leak prevention; results are comparable to those of stapling devices, but this system seems to have a better benefit/cost ratio. Larger series are needed to confirm these data.},

METHODS: We treated twelve patients 8 patients male and 4 female. The average age was 47,3 years (22-75 years). The interested vertebrae and therefore the procedures have been 13 since in a patient two vertebrae have been treated. In 9 cases the interested vertebra was L1, in 2 cases L2 and one case D11 and D12. Following the classification of Magerl 9 fractures were of A1.2 fractures and one fracture respectively of type A1.3, A2.2, A2.3, A3.1. We have never placed indication to Balloon Kyphoplasty in the fractures of the type B and C, neither in the complete burst fractures (A3.2 and A3.3), neither in the fractures of the A1.1 type. Balloon Kyphoplasty has been carried out using the Kyphon system (Kyphon Inc. Sunnyvale, CA, USA). In the patients older than 50 years (7 cases) we have used polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), as filling material, while in the patients younger than 50 years (5 in total), we have used Calcibon (Biomet, Inc.Warsaw, Indiana) in 4 cases and in one case a new material called KyphOs (Kyphon Inc. Sunnyvale, CA, USA). These last two types of material are made up of tricalcium phosphate that, although less manageable of the PMMA and less resistant initially, in the time it will be reabsorbed and osteointegrated. RESULTS: The method demonstrated swift pain relief associated with an evident augmentation in the resistance and restoration of the vertebral body's physiological shape. No patient has worn a postoperative orthesis. In all the cases we obtained an optimal stabilization in the follow-up minimal to 4 months. In no case we observed a structural yielding of the vertebra. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty is an effective, alternative, simple and safe treatment of traumatic fracture of the thoracolumbar junction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the best treatment of unstable thoraco-lumbar (TL) burst fractures. Kyphosis correction and canal decompression in case of a neurological deficit are recognized treatment objectives, and various conservative and surgical strategies have been proposed. This prospective observational study evaluates the benefits and risks of a posterior bisegmental transpedicular correction/fixation and staged anterior corpectomy and titanium cage implantation in unstable TL junction burst fractures. METHOD: 20 consecutive patients with a single-level traumatic unstable burst fracture at the TL junction were operated on by a bisegmental posterior correction/fixation, followed by anterior corpectomy and titanium cage implantation 7-10 days later. The radiological and clinical course is documented over a period of 24 months. FINDINGS: The mean posttraumatic loss of anterior vertebral body height was 58{\%} (45-70{\%}). The posttraumatic mean regional kyphosis was 16 degrees and could be corrected by the posterior approach to a mean lordosis of 2 degrees. Mean secondary loss of the kyphosis correction was 3 degrees over 24 months. No hardware failure occurred, and construct stability was observed in all 20 patients. One surgical complication occurred during the posterior approach, and three transient surgical complications by the anterior approach. 12 of the 14 patients with an initial neurological deficit recovered an average of 1.5 grades on the ASIA scale. At 24 months postoperatively, the mean regional TL back pain on a VAS (0-10) was 1.6, and the mean pain at the anterior approach site was 1.2. CONCLUSION: Posterior bisegmental transpedicular correction/fixation and staged anterior corpectomy and titanium cage implantation is a safe and reliable surgical treatment option in unstable TL junction burst fractures. The advantages of this technique are a complete kyphosis correction, immediate stability, maintenance of kyphosis correction, and complete spinal canal decompression in case of a neurological deficit. However, these advantages have to be carefully weighed against the double approach morbidity.},

abstract = {A finite element model of the T12-L1 motion segment was subjected to dynamic vertical impact to investigate vertebral burst fracture mechanism at the thoracolumbar junction. A rigid ball was directed vertically towards a rigid plate fixed on top of the T12 vertebral body to simulate the axial impact. The results show that upon impact, the T12 vertebra exhibited a vibratory motion. At its maximum compression, the endplates bulged towards their vertebral bodies. The central parts of the endplates adjacent to the nucleus experienced the highest effective stress, and localized stress concentration developed correspondingly within the central parts of the cancellous bone adjacent to the endplates. This appears to confirm the hypothesis that nucleus material is forced to enter the vertebral body, pressurizing it further and squeezing the fat and marrow contents out of the cancellous bone. When the nucleus material enters the vertebral body faster than fat and marrow being expulsed, the vertebral body could burst through the anterior and posterior cortical shell. Upon sudden posterior cortex fracture, the transient fragment encroachment could be further into the spinal canal than the final observed locations, as the fragments are retropulsed to the vertebral body during the bursting process.},

abstract = {Osteoporotic burst fractures with neurologic symptoms are typically treated with  neural decompression and multilevel instrumented fusion. These large surgical interventions are challenging because of patients' advanced ages, medical co-morbidities, and poor fixation secondary to osteoporosis. The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to describe a novel technique for the treatment of osteoporotic burst fractures and symptomatic spinal stenosis via a limited thoracolumbar decompression with open cement augmentation [vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP)]. Indications for decompression and cement augmentation were intractable pain at the level of a known osteoporotic burst fracture with symptoms of spinal stenosis. As such, 25 patients (mean age, 76.1 years) with low-energy, osteoporotic, thoracolumbar burst fractures (7 males, 18 females; 39 fractures) were included. In all cases, laminectomy of the stenotic level(s) was followed by vertebral cement augmentation (9 VP; 16 KP). When a spondylolisthesis at the decompressed level was present, instrumentation was applied across the listhetic level (n = 9). Clinical outcome (1 = poor to 4 = excellent) was assessed on last clinical follow-up (mean, 44.8 wks). In addition, a modified MacNab's grading criteria was used to objectively assess patient outcomes postoperatively. Radiographic analysis of sagittal contour was assessed preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at final follow-up. The average time from onset of symptoms to intervention was 19 weeks (range, 0.3-94 wks). A mean of 1.6 fractures/patient was augmented (range, 1-3 fractures) and 2.8 levels were decompressed (range, 1-6 levels). No statistical difference in anatomic distribution or number of fractures between the VP and KP groups or in the instrumented versus noninstrumented patients was noted (P {\textgreater} 0.05). An overall subjective outcome score of 3.4 was noted. Twenty of 25 patients were graded as excellent/good according to the modified MacNab's criteria. The choice of augmentation procedure or use of instrumentation did not predict outcome (P = 0.08). Overall, 1.7 degrees of sagittal correction was obtained at final follow-up. One patient was noted to have progressive kyphosis after KP. The use of a limited-posterior decompression and open cement augmentation via VP or KP is a safe treatment option for patients who have osteoporotic burst fractures and who are incapacitated from fracture pain and concomitant stenosis. After thoracolumbar decompression, open VP/KP provides direct visualization of the posterior vertebral body wall, allowing for safe cement augmentation of burst fractures, stabilizing the spine, and obviating the need for extensive spinal reconstruction. Although clinically successful, this technique warrants careful patient selection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional outcomes of neurologically intact patients with burst fractures may be dependent on final kyphosis at the end of treatment. Conservative treatment is indicated if an acceptable sagittal alignment of the spine can be anticipated. Thoracolumbar burst fractures are often grouped as a single entity where, in fact, anatomically distinct areas of the spine may behave differently owing to different biomechanical factors. The goal of this work was to evaluate differential behavior in terms of final kyphosis in anatomically distinct regions of the spine following stable burst fractures. METHODS: Prospective analysis of kyphosis in 60 patients treated conservatively for traumatic thoracolumbar burst fracture was conducted. Initial trauma supine radiographs were measured for initial kyphosis (Ki). Final kyphosis (Kf) in the upright patient was measured at the end of treatment. The Ki and Kf were plotted on a scatter graph; with use of linear regression analysis, a mathematical model was created to define a relationship between Ki and Kf based on anatomic level of the spine. RESULTS: The thoracolumbar spine behaved in two independent patterns with respect to Kf. Kf at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L1) had a collapse pattern that could be approximated most accurately with the equation Kf = Ki + 0.5 Ki. At the midlumbar spine, L2-L3 level, a best-fit model for collapse was Kf = Ki + 4 degrees . CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients, fractures that were categorized as "stable" and not requiring surgery were studied for the purpose of determining differential collapse patterns in anatomically distinct areas of the lumbar spine. We have demonstrated that the thoracolumbar junction and the midlumbar spine behave differently biomechanically and recommend that these two anatomic levels be studied independently for research purposes.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In a human cadaveric burst fracture model, the amount of endplate fracture reduction after posterior instrumentation and balloon vertebroplasty was investigated quantitatively. OBJECTIVES: To assess, in a burst fracture model, the vertebral body and adjacent disc heights, in parallel sagittal planes with 3-dimensional (3D) rotational x-ray imaging, at various phases during pedicle screw fixation and subsequent balloon vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In recent human cadaveric thoracolumbar fracture studies, it was found that vertebral body height could be restored significantly with inflatable bone tamps. However, limited quantitative data exist on the amount of fracture reduction that can be achieved and how much of the reduction will be lost after deflation and removal of the bone tamps before the cement is injected. METHODS: Twenty burst fractures were created and balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement was performed after pedicle screw instrumentation. A 3D dataset was obtained during the following phases: intact, fractured, after reduction and stabilization with pedicle screws, after inflation of the balloons, after deflation and removal of the balloons, after injection of the cement. The fractured vertebral body and adjacent disc heights were measured from five reconstructed sagittal images and compared for the six phases of the procedure. Furthermore, the difference between the vertebral body height centrally and peripherally was calculated. RESULTS: The mean vertebral body height at the thoracic level was Tintact = 19.5 +/- 2.2 mm, Tfractured = 14.6 +/- 3.8 mm, Treduction = 17.3 +/- 2.2 mm, Tinflation = 20.1 +/- 2.0 mm, Tdeflation = 18.0 +/- 2.0 mm, and Tcement = 17.8 +/- 1.8 mm. The overall change in vertebral body height between these phases was significant (P {\textless} 0.001). At the lumbar level the mean vertebral body height was Tintact = 23.2 +/- 3.8 mm, Tfractured = 14.7 +/- 3.0 mm, Treduction = 18.4 +/- 2.5 mm, Tinflation = 23.2 +/- 3.5 mm, Tdeflation = 19.3 +/- 2.3 mm, and Tcement = 20.2 +/- 2.8 mm. The overall change in MCVBH between these phases was also significant (P {\textless} 0.001). The increase in vertebral body height resulted in a decrease of the adjacent disc height. No difference was found for the amount of endplate reduction in the center or at the periphery. No leakage of cement was detected in the spinal canal. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of endplate fractures, both in the center and at the periphery, seems feasible and safe with combined fracture reduction and balloon vertebroplasty. The endplate fracture reduction that was gained by inflation of the bone tamps could not be maintained after deflation.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In a human cadaveric burst fracture model with and without longitudinal ligament damage, the amount of anterior and posterior bone displacement (ABD, PBD) during balloon vertebroplasty after pedicle-screw instrumentation was investigated quantitatively. OBJECTIVES: To investigate, in a burst fracture model with and without longitudinal ligament damage, the amount of ABD, PBD, and cement leakage at various phases during balloon vertebroplasty in combination with pedicle-screw instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The role of intact longitudinal ligaments in traumatic spine fractures, for prevention of bone retropulsion and subsequent reduction, has been discussed in several studies but is still up for debate. In a recent human cadaveric burst fracture study, inflatable bone tamps and calcium phosphate cement were used for the augmentation of the anterior column after pedicle-screw instrumentation. The additional balloon vertebroplasty procedure was found to be feasible and safe, but no data pertaining to unwarranted bone displacement or cement leakage during the procedure are available for burst fractures with damaged longitudinal ligaments. METHODS: Ten thoracic and 10 lumbar burst fractures, with rotation or flexion components, were created, and balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement was performed after pedicle-screw instrumentation. Volumetric datasets (using the 3-dimensional (3D) rotational x-ray imaging technique) of the fractures were obtained during the following phases: intact, fractured, after reduction and stabilization with pedicle-screws, after inflation of the balloons, after deflation and removal of the balloons, and after injection of the cement. The amount of ABD and PBD was measured on reconstructed sagittal images and recorded together with the presence of extracorporal cement leakage. The continuity of the longitudinal ligaments was assessed after anatomic dissection. RESULTS: During the balloon vertebroplasty procedure, a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) increase of ABD (at both thoracic and lumbar level) and PBD (thoracic level) occurred after inflation of the balloons. After deflation and subsequent injection of the cement, however, the ABD and PBD returned to the preinflation levels. The absolute amount of ABD and PBD ({\textless}1 mm) during inflation was considered of little clinical importance. No differences in ABD or PBD were observed for specimens with or without continuity of the corresponding longitudinal ligament, irrespective of the level, at any of the phases during the experiment (P {\textgreater} 0.5 in all cases). A small amount of cement leakage was observed in the psoas compartment of one specimen with intact longitudinal ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that balloon vertebroplasty after pedicle-screw instrumentation may safely be used, in terms of bone displacement and cement leakage, in fracture types where damage to longitudinal ligaments is to be expected.},

Patients included in the study had limited neurologic function, a single-level burst fracture involving T11-L2, and no distraction or rotation trauma. Patients in the control group (n = 45) were treated with short-segment posterior instrumentation alone, whereas patients in the augmented group (n = 75) were treated with a titanium block designed for transpedicle body reconstruction. The followup was 24-70 months. The operation time and blood loss were similar in both groups. The immediate postoperative anterior vertebral restoration rate of the augmented group was similar to that of the control group (96.8{\%} +/- 2.1{\%} versus 96.7{\%} +/- 3.0{\%}). The final anterior vertebral restoration was greater in the augmented group than in the control group (93.7{\%} +/- 3.0{\%} versus 66.3{\%} +/- 10.5{\%}). Immediate postoperative kyphotic angles were not significantly different between the groups (3.2 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees versus 5.5 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees). The final kyphotic angles were less in the augmented group than the control group (6.7 degrees +/- 3.0 degrees versus 19.6 degrees +/- 5.1 degrees). The control group had more implant failures than the augmented group. The augmented group had better results according to the Denis pain scale. Posterior body reconstruction with a transpedicle body augmenter can maintain kyphosis correction and vertebral restoration, prevent implant failure, and lead to better clinical results.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reproducibility and repeatability of modern systems for classification of thoracolumbar injuries have not been sufficiently studied. We assessed the interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of the AO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen) classification and compared it with that of the Denis classification. Our purpose was to determine whether the newer, AO system had better reproducibility than the older, Denis classification. METHODS: Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs and computerized tomography scans (axial images and sagittal reconstructions) of thirty-one acute traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were presented to nineteen observers, all trained spine surgeons, who classified the fractures according to both the AO and the Denis classification systems. Three months later, the images of the thirty-one fractures were scrambled into a different order, and the observers repeated the classification. The Cohen kappa (kappa) test was used to determine interobserver and intraobserver agreement, which was measured with regard to the three basic classifications in the AO system (types A, B, and C) as well as the nine subtypes of that system. We also measured the agreement with regard to the four basic types in the Denis classification (compression, burst, seat-belt, and fracture-dislocation) and with regard to the sixteen subtypes of that system. RESULTS: The AO classification was fairly reproducible, with an average kappa of 0.475 (range, 0.389 to 0.598) for the agreement regarding the assignment of the three types and an average kappa of 0.537 for the agreement regarding the nine subtypes. The average kappa for the agreement regarding the assignment of the four Denis fracture types was 0.606 (range, 0.395 to 0.702), and it was 0.173 for agreement regarding the sixteen subtypes. The intraobserver agreement (repeatability) was 82{\%} and 79{\%} for the AO and Denis types, respectively, and 67{\%} and 56{\%}, for the AO and Denis subtypes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Denis and the AO system for the classification of spine fractures had only moderate reliability and repeatability. The tendency for well-trained spine surgeons to classify the same fracture differently on repeat testing is a matter of some concern.},

There was no significant difference in TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or IL-8 levels of expression according to liver-activity grade, liver-fibrosis stage, the concentration of HCV RNA at liver biopsies, or the HCV genotype. However, IFN-gamma/beta-actin mRNA concentration was higher than the IL-10/beta-actin mRNA concentration in patients with F3 Metavir score. Median IFN-gamma/beta-actin mRNA concentration tended to be higher in patients with A3 and A4 Metavir activity grades compared with those with A0 and A1 activity grades. There was a significant correlation between the duration of HCV infection and both TGF-beta/beta-actin (r(2)=0.19, P=0.04) and IL-8/beta-actin mRNA concentrations (r(2)=0.19, P=0.03). IFN-gamma/beta-actin mRNA concentration also increased according to the duration of HCV (r(2)=0.19, P=0.07). Finally, there was a significant correlation between the duration of HCV infection and liver fibrosis stage (r(2)=0.17, P=0.045). Intrahepatic Th1 cytokine profile seems to be predominant in patients with extensive fibrosis and activity scores, suggesting that it might be responsible for liver injury in renal transplant patients.},

abstract = {Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, radiologically guided procedure whereby bone cement is injected into structurally weakened vertebrae to provide added biomechanical stability. In addition to treating osteoporotic vertebral fractures, this technique is also used to relieve pain by stabilizing metastatically compromised vertebrae that are at risk of pathologic burst fracture. Optimal cement distribution patterns to improve biomechanical stability to metastatically involved vertebral bodies remain unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of cement location and volume of cement injected during percutaneous vertebroplasty on improving vertebral stability in a metastatically-compromised spinal motion segment using a parametric poroelastic finite element model. A three-dimensional parametric finite element model of a thoracic spinal motion segment was developed and analyzed using commercially available software. A total of 16 metastatic pre and post vertebroplasty scenarios were investigated using a serrated spherical representation of tumor tissue and various geometric representations of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The effect of vertebroplasty on vertebral bulge, a measure of posterior vertebral body wall motion as an indicator of burst fracture initiation, was assessed. In all cases, vertebroplasty reduced vertebral bulge, but the risk of the initiation of burst fracture was minimized with cement located posterior to the tumor, near the posterior vertebral body wall. Vertebral bulge decreased by up to 62{\%} with 20{\%} cement injection.

abstract = {The biosynthesis of oxygenated arachidonic acid messengers triggered by cerebral  ischemia-reperfusion is preceded by an early and rapid phospholipase A2 activation reflected in free arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accumulation. These fatty acids are released from membrane phospholipids. Both fatty acids are derived from dietary essential fatty acids; however, only DHA, the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain, is concentrated in phospholipids of various cells of brain and retina. Synaptic membranes and photoreceptors share the highest content of DHA of all cell membranes. DHA is involved in memory formation, excitable membrane function, photoreceptor cell biogenesis and function, and neuronal signaling, and has been implicated in neuroprotection. In addition, this fatty acid is required for retinal pigment epithelium cell (RPE) functional integrity. Here we provide an overview of the recent elucidation of a specific mediator generated from DHA that contributes at least in part to its biological significance. In oxidative stress-challenged human RPE cells and rat brain undergoing ischemia-reperfusion, 10,17S-docosatriene (neuroprotectin D1, NPD1) synthesis evolves. In addition, calcium ionophore A23187, IL-1beta, or the supply of DHA enhances NPD1 synthesis. A time-dependent release of endogenous free DHA followed by NPD1 formation occurs, suggesting that a phospholipase A2 releases the mediator's precursor. When NPD1 is infused during ischemia-reperfusion or added to RPE cells during oxidative stress, apoptotic DNA damage is down-regulated. NPD1 also up-regulates the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bcl-2 and BclxL and decreases pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad expression. Moreover, NPD1 inhibits oxidative stress-induced caspase-3 activation. NPD1 also inhibits IL-1beta-stimulated expression of COX-2. Overall, NPD1 protects cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Because photoreceptors are progressively impaired after RPE cell damage in retinal degenerative diseases, understanding of how these signals contribute to retinal cell survival may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Moreover, NPD1 bioactivity demonstrates that DHA is not only a target of lipid peroxidation, but rather is the precursor to a neuroprotective signaling response to ischemia-reperfusion, thus opening newer avenues of therapeutic exploration in stroke, neurotrauma, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, aiming to up-regulate this novel cell-survival signaling.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A feasibility study of the classification of spine injuries by CT and MRI data according to the classification of Magerl for spine injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 39 patients, 46 injured vertebrae were evaluated by means of CT and MRI. A single-slice helical CT (Somatom Plus S, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used with a collimation and feed of 2 mm and 3 mm, respectively. Sagittal reformations were reconstructed from these data sets. MR imaging was performed with 1.5T and 1.0T machines (Magnetom Vision and Magnetom Impact, Siemens). Transverse and sagittal T1-w SE- images as well as sagittal T2-w TSE- and STIR-images were generated. Each fractured vertebra was independently categorized two times according to the classification of Magerl on the basis of CT- and MRI-images. The CT- and MRI-classifications were subsequently compared. RESULTS: Most fractures were classified as impaction fractures (A1) or burst fractures (A3). Only 5/46 injuries of vertebrae were not given the same classification by means of CT and MRI (r = 0.9). MRI showed more bony lesions than CT (n. s., p {\textgreater} 0.05) and was able to evaluate ruptures of the longitudinal ligaments in 5 patients. CONCLUSION: Classification of spine injuries according to the Magerl-classification showed a significant agreement between CT and MRI and therefore a comparable evaluation of stability. MRI was superior in delineating ligamental lesions.},

METHODS: From August 1999 to March 2003, 76 patients(48 males and 28 females, aged from 22 to 59 with an average of 34.1) with thoracolumbar fracture were operatively treated by ARRIF. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 21 months (15 months in average). Classification according to injury segment: flexion compression fracture 27 cases, burst fracture 42 cases, flexion distraction injury 3 cases, flexion revolving type fracture dislocation 2 cases, shear force type dislocation 2 cases. Classification according Frankel's grade: A grade 16 cases, B grade 15 cases, C grade 27 cases, D grade 10 cases, E grade 8 cases. Operation duration, volume of bleeding, incidence post-operation complication and effect of reduction-fixation were observed. RESULTS: The operation duration of ARRIF was 1.2 h in average, and there was about 200 ml volume of bleeding during operation. The nerve function showed one Frankel's grade improvement after operation were as follows: A grade 8 cases (50{\%}), B grade 11 cases (73.3{\%}), C grade 20 cases (74.1{\%}), D grade 3 cases (30{\%}); 2 Frankel's E cases have no nerve function changes. The nerve function damage have no aggravation in all the patients, the postoperation Cobb's angle was averagely corrected 22 degrees. The horizontal displacement of dislocation vertebrae was averagely corrected 28{\%} in sagittal plane, the statistical analysis had significant variance (P {\textless} 0.01). ARRIF had no complications of the breakage of screws and rods. CONCLUSION: ARRIF proves to be a valid internal fixator in reducing and fixing different thoracic lumbar segment spine fracture.},

OBJECTIVES: To try to establish a correlation between neurological deficits and the degree of narrowing of the spinal canal. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The correlation between the degree of protrusion of the bone fragments into the spinal canal and the incidence of neurological deficits in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures has not been well established, raising a lot of controversies in the literature. METHODS: Manual measurements of axial-computed tomography scan films using a millimetric ruler were made from the spinal canal of 198 patients admitted to the hospital with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures, from 1989 to 2000. RESULTS: The probability of neurological deficit in a patient with 25, 50, and 75{\%} narrowing of the thoracolumbar spinal canal was found to be 12, 41, and 78{\%}, and in the lumbar spinal canal it was 8, 30, and 68{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The narrowing of the spinal canal proved to be a predictive factor in establishing early neurological deficits in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures, showing a positive correlation between narrowing of the spinal canal and the severity of the incomplete neurological deficit by the Frankel classification. Patients with complete spinal cord injuries (Frankel A) did not show this correlation.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Surgical intervention for thoracolumbar burst fractures is indicated for  patients with neurological deficits and/or evidence of severe spinal instability. The goals of surgery are decompression, deformity correction, and stabilization. Nevertheless, the optimal surgical strategy to achieve these goals remains a subject of debate. Short-segment pedicle screw fixation is associated with a 20 to 50{\%} incidence of pedicle screw failure and progressive spinal deformity. Initial biomechanical and clinical studies have shown that reinforcement of short-segment pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty improves spinal stability and decreases instrument failure rates. In this study, the authors describe their initial clinical experience with kyphoplasty used to augment short-segment pedicle screw fixation of traumatic lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Five patients with traumatic burst fractures of the lumbar spine were included in this retrospective review of patients treated for this disorder at the University of California, San Diego and the University of California, San Francisco between 2002 and 2004. All patients underwent transpedicular kyphoplasty and short-segment pedicle screw fixation. The mean follow-up period was 10.6 months (range 6-18 months). All patients underwent short-segment pedicle screw fixation reinforced with polymethyl methacrylate kyphoplasty. The preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up plain x-ray films were evaluated. Radiographic analysis included measurements of kyphotic angulation, anterior vertebral body height, and evidence of bone fusion. Clinical evaluation was performed postoperatively and at follow-up review. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the authors' initial experience, kyphoplasty supplementation may improve the long-term integrity of short-segment pedicle screw constructs and allow for improved rates of fusion and better clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic lumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A validation study was done in which reconstructed three-dimensional rotational x-ray images were quantitatively compared with corresponding anatomic sections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of reconstructed images acquired on a three-dimensional rotational x-ray imaging device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive procedures have proven quite successful as alternatives for a multitude of open treatments. An unfavorable property of this type of procedure is a lack of direct vision of the operating area. Three-dimensional rotational x-ray imaging may be able to merge the advantages of computed tomography and fluoroscopy: real-time two-dimensional projections for fast visual feedback and three-dimensional reconstructions for detailed volumetric imaging of complex anatomy. METHODS: Twenty traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were created and underwent pedicle screw instrumentation and balloon vertebroplasty. Subsequently, a three-dimensional dataset was obtained, and the midsagittal image was reconstructed. The specimens were sliced, and photographs were obtained. Multiple parameters on the reconstructed images and photographs were measured two times by two observers using a graphical method. The differences and standard deviations were calculated for the corresponding parameters and for the intraobserver data. RESULTS: The mean difference between the corresponding values ranged between -1.1 and 2.1 mm for all parameters. The standard deviation for the differences per parameter ranged between 1.2 and 3.2 mm. The intraobserver differences ranged from -0.8 to 1.4 mm, and the standard deviation varied between 0.4 and 2.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed midsagittal images were accurate in all measured parameters. The three-dimensional rotational x-ray technique may prove to be valuable for less invasive spine surgery.},

The average follow-up was 77.5 (31-137) months and average patient age (23 women, 25 men) was 46 (18-76) years. Twenty-nine patients suffered a fall from a height and 13 patients were injured in traffic accidents. Thirty-two patients had compression-type fractures and 16 burst-type fractures. There were no neurological deficits. Twenty-nine patients were treated by orthosis, 13 by body cast and six by bed rest. In addition to pain and functional scoring, we measured a number of radiographic parameters at the time of admission and at latest follow-up and compared the values. In patients with compression fractures there were significant changes in scoliosis angle and wedging index (p{\textless}0.05). The mean pain score was 1.66 and mean functional score 1.03. In patients with burst fractures, vertebral index, wedging index and height loss increased after treatment (p{\textless}0.05). The mean pain score was 1.26 and functional score 0.93. Compression fractures with kyphosis angle {\textless}30 degrees are supposed to be stable and can be treated conservatively. If the kyphosis angle is more than 30 degrees, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed, and if the posterior ligamentous complex is damaged, surgery should be considered. In burst fractures, MRI should always be performed and conservative treatment should only be considered if there is no neurological deficit and the ligaments are intact.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment of "unstable" thoracolumbar injuries remains controversial. Studies have shown the advantages of direct anterior decompression of thoracolumbar injuries along with supplemental posterior instrumentation as a combined or staged procedure. Others have also shown success in decompression as a single-stage anterior procedure, largely limited to two-column (anterior and middle) injuries. A retrospective review of all available clinical and radiographic data was used to classify unstable three-column thoracolumbar fractures according to the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO) classification system. This was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of stand-alone anterior decompression and reconstruction of unstable three-column thoracolumbar injuries, utilizing current-generation anterior spinal instrumentation. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1998, 40 patients underwent anterior decompression and two-segment anteriorly instrumented reconstruction for three-column thoracolumbar fractures. Retrospective review of all available clinical and radiographic data was used to classify these unstable injuries according to the AO classification system, evaluating for neurologic changes, spinal canal compromise, preoperative and postoperative segmental angulation, and arthrodesis rate. RESULTS: According to the AO classification system, there were 24 (60{\%}) type B1.2, 10 (25{\%}) type B2.3, 5 (12.5{\%}) type C1.3, and 1 (2.5{\%}) type C2.1 three-column injuries. Preoperative canal compromise averaged 68.5{\%} and vertebral height loss averaged 44.5{\%}. There were no cases of neurologic deterioration, and 30 (91{\%}) patients with incomplete neurologic deficits improved by at least one modified Frankel grade. Mean preoperative segmental kyphosis of 22.7 degrees was improved to an early mean of 7.4 degrees (P {\textless} 0.0001). At latest follow-up, angulation had increased by an average 2.1 degrees but maintained significant improvement from preoperative measurements (P {\textless} 0.0001). There was one early construct failure due to technical error. Thirty-seven of the remaining patients (95{\%}) went on to apparently stable arthrodesis. CONCLUSIONS: Current types of anterior spinal instrumentation and reconstruction techniques can allow some types of unstable three-column thoracolumbar injuries to be treated in an anterior stand-alone fashion. This allows direct anterior decompression of neural elements, improvement in segmental angulation, and acceptable rates of arthrodesis without the need for supplemental posterior instrumentation.},

In three biomechanical in vitro studies, burst fracture stabilisation was simulated, and anterior short fixation devices were tested under load with pure moments up to 3.75 Nm to evaluate the biomechanical stabilising characteristics of different kinds of instrumentations in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Only anterior four-point stabilisation resulted in sufficient primary stability both in mono- and bisegmental instrumentation and therefore represents the standard procedure in open as well as in minimally invasive spinal surgery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The authors present a retrospective evaluation of a group of patients with injury to the lower cervical spine. The aim of the study is to show current trends in the diagnosis and treatment of this trauma. MATERIAL: Between 1995 and 2003, 363 patients with trauma to the lower cervical spine were treated in our clinic. They included 63 women and 300 men, who fell into age categories as follows:14-19 years, 52 patients; 20-29, 108 patients; 30-39, 76 patients; 40-49, 57 patients; 50-59, 40 patients; 60-69, 22 patients; over 70, 8 patients. Neurological findings were classified as Frankel A in 109 patients, Frankel B in 24 patients, Frankel C in 19 patients, Frankel D in 12 patients and Frankel E in 199 patients. The trauma was due to a car or motorcycle accident in 183 patients, a fall from a height in 67 patients, a dive in water in 57 patients, a fall of the pedestrian in 47 patients and other causes in 9 patients. According to the level of the vertebra injured, fractures of the fifth cervical vertebra and the C6/7 segment were most frequent; fractures of the C7/T1 segment were least frequent. The AO classification showed type A injury in 22 {\%}, type B in 23 {\%} and type C in 55 {\%} of the patients. METHODS: Conservative treatment was carried out in 100 patients, of whom 56 had a halo vest and 44 received a Philadelphia collar. Surgery was performed in 463 patients, most of whom, i. e., 246 patients, were treated from the anterior approach. Monocortical stabilization was used in 228 patients, bicortical fixation in 18 patients. Fifteen patients were treated from the posterior approach and two patients underwent a combined two-stage treatment. RESULTS: In the group of 263 patients treated surgically, there were several complications. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve were recorded in nine patients, an abscess in the operative wound following the anterior approach developed in one patient and a hematoma of the anterior operation wound requiring revision surgery occurred in two patients. Complications involving implants were the following: fracture of the anterior plate in one patient, failure of anterior plate fusion in two patients, failure of posterior plate fusion in one patient and loosening of two anterior, bicortically inserted screws in one patient. Pseudoarthrosis was recorded in one patient with a fracture of the cervical spine locking plate. In the remaining patients (99.8 {\%}) bony union was achieved by 6 months. Of the 363 patients, 164 had a medullary lesion; of these 17 died. Sixteen were classified as having Frankel A lesions and one having a Frankel B lesion. The cause of death was unrelated to the operation. Six patients with neurological deficit were transferred abroad. A patient diagnosed by the neurologist as Frankel A remained included in this group, although an improvement in his neurological status suggested an incomplete medullary lesion. Of the 141 patients with neurological deficit who were followed up for more than one year, 60 showed an improvement in neurological findings. DISCUSSION: The treatment of fractures of the lower cervical spine aims a decompression of the affected nerve structures and at restoration of the correct position and stability of the cervical spine. It is predominantly performed from the anterior approach; the posterior approach is used less frequently, only when indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of injuries to the lower cervical spine is based on the medical history, X-ray images in three basic projections and a CT scan. The necessity of a pre-operative MRI examination has recently been discussed. The use of the anterior approach in treatment of the injured lower spine is safe and effective. It allows us to carry out decompression as well as insertion of a graft and plate under direct visual control. It is associated with a minimum of complications and a high probability of bony fusion. Only immediate decompression will facilitate the regeneration of an injured spinal cord. Key words: cervical spine, spinal injury, anterior fixation.},

METHODS: The radiographic and computed tomography scan images of 45 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were reviewed by 5 observers on 2 different occasions 3 months apart. Interobserver reliability was assessed by comparison of the fracture classifications determined by the 5 observers. Intraobserver reliability was evaluated by comparison of the classifications determined by each observer on the first and second sessions. Ten paired interobserver and 5 intraobserver comparisons were then analyzed with use of kappa statistics. RESULTS: All 5 observers agreed on the final classification for 58{\%} and 73{\%} of the fractures on the first and second assessments, respectively. The average kappa coefficient for the 10 paired comparisons among the 5 observers was 0.79 (range 0.73-0.89) for the first assessment and 0.84 (range 0.81-0.95) for the second assessment. Interobserver agreement improved when the 3 components of the classification system were analyzed separately, reaching an almost perfect interobserver reliability with the average kappa values of 0.90 (range 0.82-0.97) for the first assessment and 0.92 (range 0.83-1) for the second assessment. The kappa values for the 5 intraobserver comparisons ranged from 0.73 to 0.87 (average 0.78), expressing at least substantial agreement; 2 observers showed almost perfect intraobserver reliability. For the 3 components of the classification system, all observers reached almost perfect intraobserver agreement with the kappa values of 0.83 to 0.97 (average, 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Kappa statistics showed high levels of agreement when the Load Sharing Classification was used to assess thoracolumbar burst fractures. This system can be applied with excellent reliability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personal watercraft (PWC) are in widespread and growing use. Injuries involving PWC have been reported, but to date no report has focused on spine injuries as a result of this activity. METHODS: We report a retrospective case series of spinal injuries related to the use of PWC that we term "wave-jumper's fracture." RESULTS: From 1995 to 1999, eight patients suffered spinal fracture after operating PWC. The mechanism of injury was of a "hard landing" on the seat of the PWC after becoming airborne. The average age was 36 years (range, 20-51 years). Fractures were compression or burst type injuries at the thoracolumbar transition zone (T12-L2). Only one patient suffered a transient neurologic injury. No patient required surgery. CONCLUSION: There is a mechanism of injury in PWC use where axial loading may cause thoracolumbar fracture. The public and physicians should be aware of the risks involved in the use of personal watercraft.},

abstract = {Thoracolumbar fractures are relatively common injuries. Numerous classification systems have been developed to characterize these fractures and their prognostic and therapeutic implications. Recent emphasis on short, rigid fixation has influenced surgical management. Most compression and stable burst fractures should be treated nonsurgically. Neurologically intact patients with unstable burst fractures that have {\textgreater}25 degrees of kyphosis, {\textgreater}50{\%} loss of vertebral height, or {\textgreater}40{\%} canal compromise often can be treated with short, rigid posterior fusions. Patients with unstable burst fractures and neurologic deficits require direct or indirect decompression. Posterior stabilization can be effective with Chance fractures and flexion-distraction injuries that have marked kyphosis, and in translational or shear injuries. Advances in understanding both biomechanics and types of fixation have influenced the development of reliable systems that can effectively stabilize these fractures and permit early mobilization.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis is a disease that is strongly genetically determined. Aromatase converts androgens to estradiol in postmenopausal women, therefore polymorphisms of the gene for this enzyme may be associated with bone mass and fracture. We investigated the association of the TTTA microsatellite polymorphism in intron 4 of the aromatase (CYP19) gene with bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture in 1,257 women aged 70 yr and greater. The data obtained were stratified based on the presence or absence of a [TTTA]n of 7 (A2), determined from a preliminary analysis of hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry BMD, which was present in 27{\%} of the population. The presence of an A2 allele was associated with a higher free estradiol index (0.52 +/- 0.49, P = 0.049) compared with the absence of an A2 allele (0.47 +/- 0.45); higher BMD at all sites of the hip (3.4{\%} total hip, 2.3{\%} femoral neck, 3.6{\%} intertrochanter, 4.1{\%} trochanter) and the lumbar spine (12.7{\%}); higher values for the calcaneal quantitative ultrasound parameters broadband ultrasound (1.3{\%}), speed of sound (0.4{\%}), and stiffness (3.7{\%}); and higher peripheral quantitative computed tomography measures for total (3.4{\%}), trabecular (3.3{\%}), and cortical BMD (3.3{\%}) and the derived stress strain index (SSI) parameters SSI polar (6.4{\%}) and SSI x (6.8{\%}) values. A lower deoxypryridinoline creatinine ratio was observed in subjects with an A2 allele (30.3 +/- 10.4 vs. 27.1 +/- 9.1, P = 0.03). The A2 allele was associated with a lower prevalence of vertebral fracture in subjects who were osteoporotic (odds ratio 0.27, confidence interval 0.09-0.79). Therefore, a common polymorphism of the aromatase gene, perhaps in linkage disequilibrium with a functionally significant CYP19 polymorphism, is associated with bone structure and bone turnover, either by local effects or by effects on circulating bioactive estrogen.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty can be very beneficial for patients with vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no mention in any literature regarding the use of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of spinal burst fracture. METHODS: A preliminary study was conducted on 6 patients with traumatic burst fractures of vertebrae treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty starting in June 2000. Fractures involving the anterior and middle columns of the vertebrae and the canal were mildly compressed by the retropulsed bone fragment. However, there was no obvious neurologic deficit in these patients. They initially underwent conservative treatment and thoracolumbar spinal orthosis (TLSO) brace for at least 3 months, but the intractable pain caused patients to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time and limited daily activity. As a result, the patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for treatment of spinal burst fractures. RESULTS: Six male patients (mean age: 38.2) who suffered from burst fractures of vertebrae with disabling back pain refractory to analgesic therapy and TLSO brace were treated in this study. The duration of conservation treatment period was 3.5 months to 8 months (mean: 5.2 months). There was no motility. However, 4 vertebrae (66.7{\%}), on radiographs revealed evidence of PMMA leakage through the endplate fracture site into either the disc space or the paravertebral space, without any evident clinical symptoms. No intracanal leakage was seen, and no patient needed a secondary surgical intervention. Pain decreased from 84.3 +/- 5.4 mm at baseline to 34.7 +/- 4.4 mm at the third postoperative day, 30.2 +/- 5.8 at 3 months and 24 +/- 3.5 mm at 12 months. The reduction in pain from baseline to the 3-day and 3 month mark was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05). The mobility was at least 2 levels of improvement (mean improvement 2.7 points) at 12-months postoperative. CONCLUSION: In highly selective patients, percutaneous vertebroplasty can be an alternative method for the treatment of spinal burst fractures and the prevention of complications from major surgical procedures. However, this procedure still has potential risks and should be employed with extreme caution to prevent extravasation of PMMA into the spinal canal.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury involves multiple factors that may be modulated by adenosine A 2A receptor activation. This study defines injury progression in terms of function, cytoarchitecture, and inflammation and assesses whether adenosine A 2A receptor activation by ATL-146e limits injury progression. METHODS: Mature swine were divided into 3 groups: sham thoracotomy, IR (30 minutes of ischemia followed by reperfusion), and ATL (ischemia/reperfusion with ATL-146e administration for the first 3 hours of reperfusion). Subgroups were killed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion. Function was followed up with Tarlov scores. Spinal cord tissue was evaluated for neuronal viability, microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry, and neutrophil sequestration (myeloperoxidase assay). Spinal cord tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum were evaluated for tumor necrosis factor-alpha by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Function was significantly impaired at 24, 36, and 48 hours in the IR group compared with the sham and ATL groups ( P {\textless} .05). Neuronal viability and microtubule-associated protein-2 staining were significantly preserved in the sham and ATL groups compared with the IR group at 24 and 48 hours ( P {\textless} .05). Spinal cord myeloperoxidase levels were significantly higher in the IR group than in the sham and ATL groups at 24 and 48 hours. Although negligible in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the spinal cord peaked significantly higher in the IR group compared with the sham and ATL groups at 6 and 24 hours ( P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion induced changes in neutrophil sequestration, microtubule-associated protein-2 expression, and neuronal viability within 24 hours of reperfusion. Spinal cord tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased significantly by 6 to 12 hours after reperfusion. Adenosine A 2A receptor activation attenuates spinal cord inflammation, which may be critical for the preservation of neuronal function and cytoarchitecture after ischemia/reperfusion.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures who were surgically treated with an anterior corpectomy and fusion with anterolateral Z-plate fixation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of the management of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures by corpectomy, structural grafting, and anterolateral internal fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures are frequently associated with instability or neurologic deficit. Modern surgical procedures for these fractures have been performed via both anterior and posterior approaches. Anterior surgical treatment allows direct decompression of the neural elements and correction of deformity. Newer anterior instrumentation devices, combined with a structural graft, allow a stable construct that may obviate a posterior procedure. An anterior procedure generally requires fusion of only two levels compared to posterior fusion, which generally requires more. METHODS: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with anterior surgery, strut graft, and fixation with a Z-plate was carried out. Fractures were considered acute if surgically treated within 30 days. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed on all 35 patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. Surgical indications were incomplete neurologic deficit, segmental kyphotic deformity, or significant comminution. All patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures with spinal cord injury were treated with an intravenous steroid protocol and were operated on within 24 hours of admission unless medically precluded. Forty-six percent (16 of 35) of patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures presented with a neurologic deficit. RESULTS: All 16 patients with neurologic deficit demonstrated at least one Frankel grade improvement on final observation, with 11 (69{\%}) patients demonstrating complete neurologic recovery. Thirty-three patients were treated with anterolateral instrumentation only. Twenty-nine of thirty patients demonstrated radiographic healing. Five were lost to follow-up observation. One patient required subsequent posterior fusion for increasing kyphotic deformity. There were no instances of hardware failure. Sagittal alignment was improved from a mean preoperative kyphosis of 18 degrees to 6 degrees at final follow-up observation. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior corpectomy, strut graft, and Z-plate fixation is an effective treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures. It allows direct decompression of the spinal cord in the acute setting and was associated with a high rate of neurologic improvement, no instances of neurologic worsening in any case, and a low complication rate.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results of nonsurgical management of burst fractures with intact posterior ligamentous complex and to investigate the effect of trauma and/or residual kyphotic deformity on adjacent and next adjacent (neighboring) discs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Conservative treatment based on integrity of posterior ligamentous complex is controversial, probably because of poor evaluation by clinical and indirect radiographic findings. Degenerative changes in the adjacent discs due to trauma and/or residual kyphotic deformity is a common expectation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients who were intact neurologically with burst fractures (T11-L2) were treated nonsurgically with the indication based solely on the integrity of posterior ligamentous complex determined by MRI. Correction of deformity and stabilization with a total body cast under sedation were the mainstays of treatment. Patients were mobilized the next day, and casts were removed at the end of the third month follow-up period with no further external stabilization. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index, and percent of compression of anterior body height were measured on pretreatment, post-treatment, third month, and latest follow-up radiographs. All of the preoperative and latest follow-up MRI studies of the patients were obtained to examine the discs adjacent and next adjacent to the fractured levels. The self-reported perceptions of the patients of function, pain and appearance were analyzed using the Likert Questionnaire. RESULTS: There were eight female and seven male patients with an average age of 28 (range, 15-49) years. Average follow-up period was 31 (range, 24-51) months. Average local kyphosis angle was found to be 16.5 degrees (0-34 degrees ) after trauma. It was corrected to 5 degrees (range, 19-25 degrees ) and deteriorated to 14.6 degrees (range, 2-25 degrees ) at the third month and to 17 degrees (range, 2-29 degrees ) at the final follow-up review. There was a similar tendency for both sagittal index and percent anterior body height. The pretreatment MRI analysis revealed changes in the shape of the discs (narrowing or herniation into the body) with no change in the signal intensity of nucleus pulposus in eight of the cranial and four of the caudal adjacent discs. On follow-up MRI, there was only one intact disc with a normal shape cranially. All others had height loss, but only one had complete loss of signal intensity. Caudally, two additional discs had changes in shape without any gross changes in signal intensity of nucleus pulposus, whereas two had changes in signal intensity without change in shape. Only two of the next adjacent discs had changes in shape or signal intensity at the time of injury or at latest follow-up review. Average score of function, pain, and appearance were 3.9 (range, 3-5), 3.7 (range, 2-5), and 3.7 (range, 2-5), respectively, at the latest follow-up review. All patients were back at work in 3.6 (range, 1-9) months on average and all were satisfied with their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that an intact posterior ligamentous complex might not prevent loss of correction gained by nonsurgical management of burst fractures. Significant loss occurs in the first 3 months despite external stabilization. However, the magnitude of residual deformity usually remains close to the initial deformity. Although changes in the shape of adjacent discs occur due to trauma and/or natural course, significant loss in signal intensity of nucleus pulposus is unlikely. Patient outcome seems to be highly satisfactory despite residual deformity.},

RESULTS: There were 88 cases of compression fracture, 54 cases of burst fracture and 10 cases of fracture-dislocation. Transverse images of MSCT could visualize all fractures directly and determine whether spinal canal was intact. Postprocessing image was helpful in depicting the displacement of fragment and orientation of dislocation.

abstract = {OBJECT: Thoracolumbar burst fractures frequently require surgical intervention. Although the use of either anterior or posterior instrumentation has advantages and disadvantages, there have been few studies in which these two approaches have been compared biomechanically. METHODS: Ten human cadaveric spines were subjected to subtotal L-3 corpectomy. In five spines placement of L-3 wooden strut grafts with lateral L2-4 dual rod and screw instrumentation was performed. Five other spines underwent L1-5 pedicle screw fixation. The spines were fatigued between steps of the experiment. The spines were load tested with pure moments of 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 Nm in the intact state and after placement of instrumentation in six degrees of freedom (flexion, extension, right and left lateral bending, and right and left axial rotation). In axial rotation posterior instrumentation significantly increased spinal rigidity compared with that of the intact state, whereas anterior instrumentation did not. Combined anterior-posterior instrumentation did not significantly increase the rigidity of the spine when compared with anterior or posterior instrumentation alone. Posterior instrumentation alone provided a greater reduction in angular rotation compared with anterior instrumentation alone in all degrees of freedom; however, statistical significance was achieved only in extension at 6 Nm. CONCLUSIONS: The increased rigidity provided by pedicle screw instrumentation compared with the intact state or with anterior instrumentation is due to the longer construct spanning five levels and the three-column engagement of the pedicle screws. The decision to use anterior or posterior instrumentation should be based on the clinical necessity of canal decompression and correction of angulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The controversy of burst fracture surgical management is addressed in this retrospective case study and literature review. METHODS: The series consisted of 40 consecutive patients, index included, with 41 fractures treated with stiff, limited segment transpedicular bone-anchored instrumentation and arthrodesis from 1987 through 1994. RESULTS: No major acute complications such as death, paralysis, or infection occurred. For the 30 fractures with pre- and postoperative computed tomography studies, spinal canal compromise was 61{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. Neurologic function improved in 7 of 14 patients (50{\%}) and did not worsen in any. The principal problem encountered was screw breakage, which occurred in 16 of the 41 (39{\%}) instrumented fractures. As we have previously reported, transpedicular anterior bone graft augmentation significantly decreased variable screw placement (VSP) implant breakage. However, it did not prevent Isola implant breakage in two-motion segment constructs. Compared with VSP, Isola provided better sagittal plane realignment and constructs that have been found to be significantly stiffer. Unplanned reoperation was necessary in 9 of the 40 patients (23{\%}). At 1- and 2-year follow-up, 95{\%} and 79{\%} of patients were available for study, and a satisfactory outcome was achieved in 84{\%} and 79{\%}, respectively. These satisfaction and reoperation rates are consistent with the literature of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these observations and the loads to which implant constructs are exposed following posterior realignment and stabilization of burst fractures, we recommend that three- or four-motion segment constructs, rather than two motion, be used. To save valuable motion segments, planned construct shortening can be used. An alternative is sequential or staged anterior corpectomy and structural grafting.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review imaging use in the diagnosis of thoracolumbar burst fractures and to determine the diagnostic value of different imaging methods. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients with 120 thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Plain radiographs were available in all cases; CT scans and MRI were obtained in 96 and 74 cases, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 27 burst fractures were misdiagnosed as other types of fractures on radiographs alone, and accounted for 22.5{\%} of all fractures. The results indicated that plain radiographs often fail to delineate the pathological features of thoracolumbar burst fractures, leading to delay in diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In regard to thoracolumbar injury diagnosis, burst fractures should be differentiated from compression fractures. CT should be routinely indicated and MRI examination, when necessary, may be simultaneously considered.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Establishment and characterization of a de novo cell line derived from human nucleus pulposus cells using a recombinant simian virus 40 (SV40) adenovirus vector. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of human nucleus pulposus cell line procurement and to evaluate the character of the resultant outcome to better understand the nature of human nucleus pulposus cells. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite recent advances in disc cell biologic research, the fundamental nature of nucleus pulposus cells, especially in the context of human cell lines, is still not well understood. Therefore, a broad-based analysis of these cells is of significant necessity. Because of the limited amount of existing human cells, establishment of an immortal cell line would greatly facilitate resource supply. METHODS: After release of informed consent, tissue samples of nucleus pulposus were obtained from the lumbar intervertebral disc of a 19-year-old man undergoing anterior fusion for burst fracture. Samples with no apparent damage were selected and digested enzymatically for primary culture and then were infected with recombinant SV40 adenovirus vector (Ad/SV40). The infected cells were maintained in culture for more than 40 population doublings, after which they were considered immortalized. Next, confirmation of expression of T antigen was performed and resultant immortalized cell lines were designated and classified as human nucleus pulposus cell line derived from Ad/SV40 infection-1 (HNPSV-1). HNPSV-1 cells were characterized and compared with their mother cells under two designated culture conditions: monolayer and three-dimensional. Morphologic and immunocytochemical analyses were performed at various intervals. Cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, proteoglycan synthesis, gene expression profiling, and karyotypic analyses were also performed. Moreover, HNPSV-1 cells were injected into rabbit discs to assess the presence of tumorigenesis. RESULTS: Recombinant SV40 adenovirus vector infected nucleus pulposus cells with relatively high efficiency (90{\%}{\textgreater} at multiplicity of infection 100). HNPSV-1 demonstrated marked prolongation of cell life with continuous cell doublings for over 5 months (60-100 cell population doublings). Despite significant increase in cell proliferation and DNA synthesis when compared with its mother cells, resultant cell lines expressed strikingly similar cell morphology and functional characteristics. Atypical karyotypes were noted; however, no apparent tumorigenesis was seen in rabbit discs 24 weeks after injection of HNPSV-1. CONCLUSIONS: HNPSV-1 was successfully established using recombinant SV40 adenovirus vector. Results showed that human nucleus pulposus cells are capable of immortalization with maintenance of original cell characteristics. It is anticipated that these cells will be useful for in vitro studies of the biologic nature of human nucleus pulposus cells.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dorsal stabilisation has represented the standard procedure for the treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine for a long time, but in the last few years the combined dorsoventral stabilisation has gained in significance due to its higher mechanical stability. However, there are no data yet available indicating whether the patients benefit from the combined operation with regard to their postoperative quality of life and what the advantages are in comparison with the dorsal procedures. Therefore, the question was researched in the framework of a matched-pairs analysis of patients suffering from an unstable fracture of the thoracolumbar transition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a consecutive series of patients treated in our clinic between 1995 and 2000, 10 patients with combined and 10 patients with a purely dorsal stabilisation were selected and included in the study. Their quality of life was summed up in retrospect with the SF-36 questionnaire. The X-rays were analysed, and the Cobb angle as well as the sagittal index were calculated. Only patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar transition without accompanying co-morbidity and neurological deficits were included in the study. Both of the treated groups were matched with regard to sex, age and radiological patterns of injury. RESULTS: Patients who had undergone only a dorsal stabilisation showed a significant loss of correction according to the sagittal index at the time of the examination (0.88+/-0.02 postoperative vs 0.77+/-0.03 at 4 years postoperatively, p=0.01). In the group of patients treated with the combined therapy, there was no statistically relevant loss of correction with regard to the sagittal vertebral profile. The SF-36 questionnaire showed a reduced quality of life in both groups compared with an age-referenced norm population, especially concerning the parameters of bodily health. No statistically relevant difference was observed between the two groups. Further, there was no statistically relevant association between the parameters of the SF-36 and the clinical and radiological data. After performing several regression analyses it could be shown that the patient's mental health is a strong predictor of the postoperative vitality (r=0.803, p{\textless}0.01). However, none of the remaining parameters was able to predict the postoperative quality of life. CONCLUSION: The patients in this study showed a reduced quality of life, independent of the method of surgical treatment. Although better radiological results could be seen for the combined procedure, regarding the postoperative quality of life no advantage could be proved compared with the dorsally stabilized patients. Furthermore, there was no relation between the radiological results and the quality of life parameters. Therefore, it can be assumed that the injury itself seems to be the main cause of the decreased quality of life after a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar transition.},

METHODS: Six fresh frozen female osteoporotic spines (T10-L5) were harvested and an anterior and posterior column unstable model of L1 was made. Each specimen was fixated with plate and the stability test were performed by flexion, extension, axial rotation and lateral bending. The test of fatigue was done with MTS 858. The tests were repeated after screws were augmented with PMMA. To compare the biomechanical stability of 6 different conditions: a. normal specimens (control), b. defect model fixed with plate, not augmented and not fatigued, c. after fatigued, not augmented, d. screws augmented with PMMA, not fatigued, e. after augmented and fatigued. RESULTS: In b., d. and e. conditions, the ranges of motion (ROM) were 6.23 +/- 1.56, 4.49 +/- 1.00, 4.46 +/- 1.83 in flexion and 6.60 +/- 1.80, 4.41 +/- 0.82, 4.46 +/- 1.83 in extension. There was no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05), they were significantly smaller than those in a. and c. conditions (8.75 +/- 1.88, 1.47 +/- 2.25 and 8.92 +/- 2.97, 12.24 +/- 3.08) (P {\textless} 0.01).

abstract = {It is known that thromboxane A2 (TXA2) contributes to various diseases such as bronchial asthma, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disorders and allergic rhinitis. A number of TXA2 synthase inhibitors and TXA2 receptor (TP receptor) antagonists have been developed to treat these diseases. Ramatroban (BAY u 3405) was developed as a potent TP receptor antagonist with excellent efficacy against allergic rhinitis in many animal models and patients. Recent studies also revealed that ramatroban can block the newly identified PGD2 receptor, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTh2). PGD2 induces migration and degranulation of eosinophils through CRTh2 and contributes to late-phase inflammation and cell damage. Accordingly, it was considered that ramatroban suppresses the late-phase inflammation via TP receptor and CRTh2 blockade. In terms of the efficacy on vascular systems, it was revealed that ramatroban can suppress the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and prevent exacerbation of inflammation by blocking these responses. According to our recent studies in hypercholesterolemic rabbits ramatroban prevents macrophage infiltration through MCP-1 downregulation and neointimal formation after balloon injury and attenuates vascular response to acetylcholine. Therefore, ramatroban may be beneficial in the treatment of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental and clinical studies have brought evidence that surgical trauma markedly affects the immune system, including both the specific and the non-specific immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report reviews the present knowledge on the mechanisms of surgical trauma-induced immune dysfunction and outlines experimental and clinical approaches to find effective treatment strategies. RESULTS: Major surgical trauma induces an early hyperinflammatory response, which is characterized by (1) pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 cytokine release and (2) neutrophil activation and microvascular adherence, as well as (3) uncontrolled polymorphonuclear (PMN) and macrophage oxidative burst. The massive and continuous IL-6 release induces an acute phase response, but, more importantly, also accounts for the up-regulation of major anti-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin (PG) E2, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ss. This results in surgical, trauma-induced, immunosuppression, as indicated by (1) monocyte deactivation, reflected by the lack of monocytic TNF- production upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and (2) a shift of the Th1/Th2 ratio towards a Th2-dominated cytokine pattern. The imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immuno-competent cells determines the phenotype of disease and should help the physician to compose the therapeutic strategy. In fact, recent clinical studies have shown that both the initial uncontrolled hyperinflammation and the continued cell-mediated immunosuppression represent primary targets to counteract post-surgery immune dysfunction. The balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory forces may be restored by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to counteract monocyte deactivation; the anti-inflammatory PGE2 may be inhibited by indomethacin to attenuate immunosuppression; or the initial hyperinflammation may be targeted by administration of anti-inflammatory substances, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), hydoxyethyl starch, or pentoxifylline. CONCLUSIONS: When drawing up the therapeutic regimen the physician should not consider hyperinflammation versus immunosuppression, but hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, aiming at restoring an appropriate mediator- and immune cell-associated balance.},

This study was designed to evaluate the role of nonoperative treatment for 29 neurologically intact patients with two- or three-column-injured thoracolumbar burst fractures. Neurologically intact patients with types A, B and C burst fractures were treated conservatively and divided into groups GI and GII, according to their column involvement, with two and three injured columns, respectively. Local kyphosis angle (LKA), anterior and posterior vertebral heights (AVH and PVH) and canal encroachment (CE) were examined for radiological parameters, while Denis' s work and pain criteria were used for clinical assessment. Remodeling determining factors of canal encroachment and the correlation between radiology and functionality were analyzed. The vertebral column deformity that occurred after the injury was stable in GI, while it was progressive for GII patients. There was significant remodeling of CE, proportional to the amount of initial CE but not related to age and radiological parameters. No correlation was found between radiological and functional parameters. None of the patients had neurological deterioration. Most of the functional results were satisfactory. As a result, it was concluded that nonoperative treatment could be an alternative method for neurologically intact two- and three-column-injured Denis-types A, B and C thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

Forty consecutive patients with such thoracolumbar fractures (T11-L1) associated with spinal canal encroachment underwent early operative postural reduction and stabilization. The patients were randomly sampled into two groups: Twenty patients received hooks in "claw configuration" in both the thoracic and the lumbar spine (group A), and 20 patients received hooks in the thoracic vertebrae and pedicle screws in the lumbar vertebrae (group B). Pre- and postoperative plain roentgenograms and computed tomography scans were used to evaluate any changes in Gardner post-traumatic kyphotic deformity, anterior and posterior vertebral body height at the fracture level, and spinal canal clearance (SCC). All patients were followed for an average period of 52 months (range 42-71 months). The correction of anterior vertebral body height was significantly more (P {\textless} 0.01) in the spines of group B (33{\%}) than in group A (16{\%}), with a subsequent 11{\%} loss of correction at the latest evaluation in group A and no loss of correction in group B. There were no significant differences in the changes of posterior vertebral body height and Gardner angle between the two groups. The SCC was significantly more (P {\textless} 0.05) immediately postoperatively in the spine of group B (32{\%}) than in group A (19{\%}). In the latest evaluation, there was a 9{\%} loss of the immediately postoperatively achieved SCC in group A, while SCC was furthermore increased at 10.5{\%} in group B. All patients with incomplete neurologic lesions in groups A and B were postoperatively improved at 1.1 and 1.7 levels, respectively. There were two hook dislodgements in the thoracic spine, one in each group, while there was no screw failure in group B. There was neither pseudarthrosis nor neurologic deterioration following surgery. Visual Analog Pain Scale and Short Form-36 scores were equally improved and did not differ between the two groups. The use of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine to stabilize the lowermost end of a long rigid construct applied for A3, B, and C thoracolumbar injuries was advantageous when compared with that using hook claws in the lumbar spine because the constructs with screws restored and maintained the fractured anterior vertebral body height better than the hooks without subsequent loss of correction and safeguarded postoperatively a continuous SCC at the injury level.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: It has been previously demonstrated that sustained nonpatterned electric stimulation of the posterior lumbar spinal cord from the epidural space can induce stepping-like movements in subjects with chronic, complete spinal cord injury. In the present paper, we explore physiologically related components of electromyographic (EMG) recordings during the induced stepping-like activity. OBJECTIVES: To examine mechanisms underlying the stepping-like movements activated by electrical epidural stimulation of posterior lumbar cord structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is based on the assessment of epidural stimulation to control spasticity by simultaneous recordings of the electromyographic activity of quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and triceps surae. We examined induced muscle responses to stimulation frequencies of 2.2-50 Hz in 10 subjects classified as having a motor complete spinal cord injury (ASIA A and B). We evaluated stimulus-triggered time windows 50 ms in length from the original EMG traces. Stimulus-evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were analyzed with reference to latency, amplitude, and shape. RESULTS: Epidural stimulation of the posterior lumbosacral cord recruited lower limb muscles in a segmental-selective way, which was characteristic for posterior root stimulation. A 2.2 Hz stimulation elicited stimulus-coupled CMAPs of short latency which were approximately half that of phasic stretch reflex latencies for the respective muscle groups. EMG amplitudes were stimulus-strength dependent. Stimulation at 5-15 and 25-50 Hz elicited sustained tonic and rhythmic activity, respectively, and initiated lower limb extension or stepping-like movements representing different levels of muscle synergies. All EMG responses, even during burst-style phases were composed of separate stimulus-triggered CMAPs with characteristic amplitude modulations. During burst-style phases, a significant increase of CMAP latencies by about 10 ms was observed. CONCLUSION: The muscle activity evoked by epidural lumbar cord stimulation as described in the present study was initiated within the posterior roots. These posterior roots muscle reflex responses (PRMRRs) to 2.2 Hz stimulation were routed through monosynaptic pathways. Sustained stimulation at 5-50 Hz engaged central spinal PRMRR components. We propose that repeated volleys delivered to the lumbar cord via the posterior roots can effectively modify the central state of spinal circuits by temporarily combining them into functional units generating integrated motor behavior of sustained extension and rhythmic flexion/extension movements. This study opens the possibility for developing neuroprostheses for activation of inherent spinal networks involved in generating functional synergistic movements using a single electrode implanted in a localized and stable region.},

In this study we identified four MBP-derived peptides that had high binding affinity to HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 and characterized the CD8(+) T cell responses and their functional properties in patients with MS. There were significantly increased CD8(+) T cell responses to 9-mer MBP peptides, in particular MBP(111-119) and MBP(87-95) peptides that had high binding affinity to HLA-A2, in patients with MS compared with healthy individuals. The resulting CD8(+) T cell lines were of the Th1 phenotype, producing TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and belonged to a CD45RA(-)/CD45RO(+) memory T cell subset. Further characterization indicated that the CD8(+) T cell lines obtained were stained with MHC class I tetramer (HLA-A2/MBP(111-119)) and exhibited specific cytotoxicity toward autologous target cells pulsed with MBP-derived peptides in the context of MHC class I molecules.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy of non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: The study included 26 patients (19 males, 7 females; mean age 36 years; range 18 to 67 years) who underwent conservative treatment for single-level thoracolumbar fractures without posterior column involvement. None of the patients had neurologic deficits and canal encroachment was 50{\%} or less in all fractures. Functional results were evaluated with the use of Denis' pain and work scales. Relationships were sought between functional results and follow-up time, progression in kyphosis angle, residual kyphosis, and residual canal stenosis, and between radiologic parameters. RESULTS: Functional results were excellent or good in 65.3{\%}, and poor in 7.7{\%}. Three patients required surgery because of pain. Final follow-up evaluations showed a significant progression in the mean Cobb angle (p{\textless}0.001) and a significant remodelization in the mean canal encroachment (p{\textless}0.001). No significant correlations were found between progression in kyphosis, residual kyphosis, residual canal stenosis, and functional results (p{\textgreater}0.05). The mean initial Cobb angle was correlated with the mean initial canal encroachment (p{\textless}0.05). There was also a correlation between the initial canal encroachment and final remodelization (p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSION: Although non-operative management of thoracolumbar fractures has considerable efficacy, it may yield poor results in a small percentage of patients, some of whom require surgery because of pain. Thus, further prospective, randomized, and comparative studies with longer follow-up periods are required to define prognostic factors that may predict poor results following non-operative treatment.},

abstract = {Clinical guidelines are a useful adjunct to select patients with spinal metastases for prophylactic intervention. The objective of this study is to determine the ability of biomechanically based models to accurately predict metastatic burst fracture risk. Ninety-two vertebrae with osteolytic spinal metastases were examined retrospectively. Vertebrae were categorized as burst fractured, wedge fractured, or intact and analyzed using three predictive models: vertebral bulge (maximum radial displacement under load), vertebral axial displacement (maximum axial displacement under load), and a volumetric estimate of tumor size. The load-bearing capacity parameter (tumor volume, bone mineral density, disc quality, pedicle involvement) was determined from computed tomography while the load-bearing requirement parameter (pressure load, loading rate) was determined using computed tomography and patient records (retrieved for 37 patients [52{\%}]). Fracture prediction was optimized using the vertebral bulge model considering only load-bearing capacity with a specificity, sensitivity, and confidence interval of 1 to yield a clear threshold for burst fracture risk. Fracture prediction in the other two models, vertebral axial displacement considering only load-bearing capacity and tumor size, also was strong with receiver-operator curve values of 0.992 and 0.988, respectively. The predictive power of these models can provide useful clinical information for prophylactic decision-making.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Conventional transpedicular decompression of the neural canal requires a considerable amount of lamina, facet joint and pedicle resection. The authors assumed that it would be possible to remove the retropulsed bone fragment by carving the pedicle with a high-speed drill without destroying the vertebral elements contributing to spinal stabilization. In this way, surgical treatment of unstable burst fractures can be performed less invasively. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate both the possibility of neural canal decompression through a transpedicular approach without removing the posterior vertebral elements, which contribute to spinal stabilization, and the adequacy of posterior stabilization of severe vertebral deformities after burst fractures. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with complete or incomplete neurological deficits as a result of the thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in this study. All patients had severe spinal canal compromise (mean, 59.53{\%}+/-14.92) and loss of vertebral body height (mean, 45.14{\%}+/-7.19). Each patient was investigated for neural canal compromise, degree of kyphosis at fracture level and fusion after operation by computed tomography and direct roentgenograms taken preoperatively, early postoperatively and late postoperatively. The neurological condition of the patients was recorded in the early and late postoperative period according to Benzel-Larson grading systems. The outcome of the study was evaluated with regard to the adequate neural canal decompression, fusion and reoperation percents and neurological improvement. METHODS: Modified transpedicular approach includes drilling the pedicle for removal of retropulsed bone fragment under surgical microscope without damaging the anatomic continuity of posterior column. Stabilization with pedicle screw fixation and posterior fusion with otogenous bone chips were done after this decompression procedure at all 28 patients included in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 28 patients showed neurological improvement. The percent of ambulatory patients was 71.4{\%} 6 months after the operation. The major complications included pseudarthrosis in five patients (17.8{\%}), epidural hematoma in one (3.5{\%}) and inadequate decompression in one (3.5{\%}). These patients were reoperated on by means of an anterior approach. Of the five pseudarthrosis cases, two were the result of infection. CONCLUSION: Although anterior vertebrectomy and fusion is generally recommended for burst fractures causing canal compromise, in these patients adequate neural canal decompression can also be achieved by a modified transpedicular approach less invasively.},

Furthermore, only 12{\%} of these ORIF involve the sacrum bone itself. No specific technique has gained wide acceptance in treating transsacral instability. In accordance with earlier publications (Kach, Josten) suggesting an internal fixator, we developed the dorsal sacrum fracture distantly anchored ORIF (DSDO). This procedure closes the dorsal pelvic ring by joining the two dorsal iliac crests (fixed-angle screws inserted in the posterior superior iliac spine) and additionally anchors in a lumbar pedicle. Thus, a three-dimensional reduction and stable fixation device with optional local nerve decompression and even plating possibility is achieved. Between January 1996 and July 2001, 35 unstable sacrum disruptions were treated with DSDO in 180 patients operated for pelvic trauma. This allowed immediate mobilization in all cases. The radiologic follow-up examination ( n=20) revealed a solid union in all patients. Complications focused on management of the soft tissue degloving injury (Morel-Lavallee lesion), which needs special attention.},

abstract = {The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and release of nitric oxide (NO) from macrophages are markedly increased in granulomatous infections. Activation of macrophages 1alpha-hydroxylase results in an increase of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. However, the significance of this increased production is not completely understood. In this study, we analyzed 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and NO production in patients with tuberculosis infection and hypercalcemia and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate RAW 264.7 cells in an attempt to assess iNOS expression and gaseous NO production regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Peroxynitrite (OONO(-)) production and lactate dehydrogenase activity were also examined. Without additional stimulation, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with tuberculosis converted more 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) than did those from normal controls. These PBMCs released less NO than did those from control subjects, at baseline and in the stimulated state. We found that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) dose-dependently inhibited iNOS messenger RNA expression of the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and also significantly reduced the gaseous NO release and OONO(-) production. Paralleling the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced inhibition of NO release were reductions in OONO(-) and LDH production. In conclusion, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibited iNOS expression and reduced NO production by LPS-stimulated macrophages in the range of physiological doses. Inhibition of the NO surge was coupled with a reduction in OONO(-) and LDH production. Increased 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) production and decreased release of NO from the PBMCs of patients with tuberculosis and hypercalcemia were also noted. We propose that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) production by macrophages may protect themselves against oxidative injuries caused by the NO burst. In the case of tuberculosis infection, increased 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) synthesis may further contribute to the development of an unwanted phenomenon-hypercalcemia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and types of multilevel vertebral body injury in association with acute spinal trauma as assessed by whole spine MRI. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: All acute admissions to a regional spinal injury unit had whole spine MRI carried out, to detect occult vertebral body injury. Two radiologists assessed 127 cases prospectively, over a period of 3 years. All cases had T2-weighted sagittal imaging of the whole spine (where possible using a T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequence), with T1-weighted imaging in both sagittal and axial planes covering the primary injury. The incidence of secondary injury (defined as either bone bruising, wedge compression fracture or burst fracture) was determined and defined by type, site and relationship to the primary injury. RESULTS: Seventy-seven per cent of cases had a secondary injury level. Of these, bone bruising was the commonest but often occurred in combination with secondary wedge compression fracture or burst fracture. MRI detected 27 non-contiguous wedge compression fractures and 16 non-contiguous burst fractures, giving an incidence of secondary level, non-contiguous fracture of approximately 34{\%}. CONCLUSION: A higher frequency of secondary vertebral body injury may be defined by MRI than has been described in previous studies based on radiographic evaluation of the whole spine. Whole spine MRI in assessment for occult vertebral body fracture enables increased confidence in the conservative or surgical management of patients with severe spinal injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the pathogenic mechanism and the clinical significance of post-traumatic thoracolumbar syringomyelia through reviewing the clinical manifestations. METHODS: The data of 15 patients (14 males and 1 female, aged from 28 to 56 years, with an average of 36 years) with post-traumatic syringomyelia treated in our hospital from December 1997 to February 2002 were studied retrospectively. Two patients suffered from T11 fractures, 7 from T12 fractures and 6 from L1 fractures. There were 12 patients with burst fractures and 3 with fracture dislocations. Anterior decompression, bone graft, bone fusion and internal fixation were made on 6 patients, posterior decompression, bone graft, bone fusion and internal fixation on 1 patient, and non-surgical treatment on 8 patients. RESULTS: Syringomyelia of the patients was diagnosed accurately with magnetic resonance imaging at 0.5-4 years after the original thoracolumbar fracture. The cavern was round in 6 cases, elliptic in 6 cases, and irregular in 3 cases. The patients also suffered from pain (80{\%}), myodynamia attenuation in lower extremities (66.7{\%}), aggravated spasm (46.7{\%}), sensation loss or hypesthesia (46.7{\%}), decreased coordinate function of lower extremities (20{\%}) and autonomic nerve symptom (6.7{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Post-traumatic thoracolumbar syringomyelia should be suspected if the patient has new neurological symptoms, such as myodynamia attenuation in lower extremities, after the neural function becomes stable for certain time.},

abstract = {Activation of adenosine A1 or A3 receptors protects heart cells from ischemia-induced injury. The A3 receptor signals via RhoA and phospholipase D (PLD) to induce cardioprotection. The objective of the study was to investigate how RhoA activates PLD to achieve the anti-ischemic effect of adenosine A3 receptors. In an established cardiac myocyte model of preconditioning using the cultured chick embryo heart cells, overexpression of the RhoA-noninteracting PLD1 mutant I870R selectively blocked the A3 agonist (Cl-IBMECA, 10 nM)-induced cardioprotection. I870R caused a significantly higher percentage of cardiac cells killed in A3 agonist-treated than in A1 agonist (CCPA, 10 nM)-treated myocytes (ANOVA and posttest comparison, P{\textless}0.01). Consistent with its inhibitory effect on the PLD activity, I870R attenuated the Cl-IBMECA-mediated PLD activation. Cl-IBMECA caused a 41 +/- 15{\%} increase in PLD activity in mock-transfected myocytes (P{\textless}0.01, paired t test) while having only a slight stimulatory effect on the PLD activity in I870R-transfected cells. To further test the anti-ischemic role of a direct RhoA-PLD1 interaction, atrial cardiac myocytes were rendered null for native adenosine receptors by treatment with irreversible A1 antagonist m-DITC-XAC and were selectively transfected with the human adenosine A1 or A3 receptor cDNA individually or they were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding either receptor plus I870R. I870R preferentially inhibited the human A3 receptor-mediated protection from ischemia. The RhoA-noninteracting PLD1 mutant caused a significantly higher percentage of cardiac cells killed in myocytes cotransfected with the human A3 receptor than in those cells expressing the human A1 receptor (ANOVA and posttest comparison, P{\textless}0.01). The present data provided the first demonstration of a novel physiological role for the direct RhoA-PLD1 interaction, that of potent protection from cardiac ischemia. The study further supported the concept that a divergent signaling mechanism mediates the anti-ischemic effect of adenosine A1 and A3 receptors.},

Stabilization plays an important role in fracture treatment, but appropriate instrumentation systems for endoscopic circumstances are lacking. Therefore a new thoracoscopically implantable stabilization system for thoracolumbar fracture treatment was developed and its biomechanical in vitro properties were compared. In a biomechanical in vitro study, burst fracture stabilization was simulated and anterior short fixation devices were tested under load with pure moments to evaluate the biomechanical stabilizing characteristics of the new system in comparison with a currently available system. With interbody graft and fixation the new system demonstrated higher stabilizing effects in flexion/extension and lateral bending and restored axial stability beyond the intact spine, as well as having comparable or improved effects compared with the current system. Because of this biomechanical characterization a clinical trial is warranted; the usefulness of the new system has already been demonstrated in 45 patients in our department and more than 300 cases in a multicenter study which is currently under way.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reinforcing short-segment pedicle screw fixation with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: We enrolled 70 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures for treatment with short-segment pedicle screw fixation. Fractures in Group A (n = 20) were reinforced with PMMA vertebroplasty during surgery. Group B patients (n = 50) were not treated with PMMA vertebroplasty. Kyphotic deformity, anterior vertebral height, instrument failure rates, and neurological function outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Kyphosis correction was achieved in Group A (PMMA vertebroplasty) and Group B (Group A, 6.4 degrees; Group B, 5.4 degrees). At the end of the follow-up period, kyphosis correction was maintained in Group A but lost in Group B (Group A, 0.33-degree loss; Group B, 6.20-degree loss) (P = 0.0001). After surgery, greater anterior vertebral height was achieved in Group A than in Group B (Group A, 12.9{\%}; Group B, 2.3{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.001). During follow-up, anterior vertebral height was maintained only in Group A (Group A, 0.13 +/- 4.06{\%}; Group B, -6.17 +/- 1.21{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.001). Patients in both Groups A and B demonstrated good postoperative Denis Pain Scale grades (P1 and P2), but Group A had better results than Group B in terms of the control of severe and constant pain (P4 and P5) (P {\textless} 0.001). The Frankel Performance Scale scores increased by nearly 1 in both Groups A and B. Group B was subdivided into Group B1 and B2. Group B1 consisted of patients who experienced instrument failure, including screw pullout, breakage, disconnection, and dislodgement (n = 11). Group B2 comprised patients from Group B who did not experience instrument failure (n = 39). There were no instrument failures among patients in Group A. Preoperative kyphotic deformity was greater in Group B1 (23.5 +/- 7.9 degrees) than in Group B2 (16.8 +/- 8.40 degrees), P {\textless} 0.05. Severe and constant pain (P4 and P5) was noted in 36{\%} of Group B1 patients (P {\textless} 0.001), and three of these patients required removal of their implants. CONCLUSION: Reinforcement of short-segment pedicle fixation with PMMA vertebroplasty for the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture may achieve and maintain kyphosis correction, and it may also increase and maintain anterior vertebral height. Good Denis Pain Scale grades and improvement in Frankel Performance Scale scores were found in patients without instrument failure (Groups A and B2). Patients with greater preoperative kyphotic deformity had a higher risk of instrument failure if they did not undergo reinforcement with vertebroplasty. PMMA vertebroplasty offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, decreases the instrument failure rate, and provides better postoperative pain control than without vertebroplasty.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVES: To determine clinical and radiographic outcomes of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures without neurologic injury treated by closed reduction and casting. Patient factors associated with poor outcome are identified. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The results of ambulatory bracing, surgery, and prolonged recumbency for burst fractures have been reported. There are no reports of results of closed reduction and casting. METHODS: Retrospective review of 41 neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures was performed. Four patients with neurologic injury who refused surgery were included, for a total of 45 patients. All patients had closed reduction and casting. Functional, pain, and employment status were assessed using the Denis system. Neurologic function was graded using the Frankel scale. Radiographic evaluation of vertebral kyphosis, regional kyphosis, anterior body compression, and sagittal index were performed at time of injury, postreduction, 4 months, and final follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients had minimal or no pain. Eight percent had constant, severe pain. At time of injury, 71{\%} of patients were employed. At 8-month follow-up, 58{\%} of patients were employed. Closed reduction resulted in significant correction of vertebral wedging from a mean of 15 degrees to 5 degrees. Deformity tended to recur by 4 months, but the degree of residual deformity appears to be less than that reported in other series. No complications resulted from the fracture reduction procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Closed reduction and casting of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures is a safe treatment method that yields acceptable functional and radiographic results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Few histological studies of pedicle screw and rod systems have been done, and spinal surgery with pedicle screw and rod system is increasing. PURPOSE: To know the biocompatibility of pedicle screw and rod systems histologically. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Titanium-based alloy pedicle screws were removed from 20 patients. Histological studies of the tissue response to the screws were performed by light microscopy. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty patients, who were diagnosed with burst type spinal fracture, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and lumbar disc herniation. OUTCOME MEASURES: All slides were observed by light microscopy, and inflammation, fibrous tissue formation, and wear debris were evaluated using a subjective scale. METHODS: Before the surgery, plain radiographs were taken to confirm the solid arthrodesis. Histological analysis was divided into four areas and studied using light microscopy. RESULTS: Inflammation and fibrous tissue formation were the main tissue reactions to the implants. No tissue surrounding the implants showed irreversible changes. Fibrous tissue was often observed at the bone-screw interface without direct contact of screw and bone at the muscle-screw interface histologically. Although some titanium debris was observed in both interfaces, no debris of inflammatory cells were seen at 1 cm distance from the screws. The inflammatory response to the screw debris was localized. CONCLUSIONS: Titanium-based alloy pedicle screws produced some metal debris and caused localized inflammation. No adverse tissue reaction was observed around the screws and rods. Direct contact without any fibrous tissue formation at the bone-screw interface was observed in some patients. A titanium-based alloy pedicle screw and rod system is considered biocompatible histologically.},

abstract = {A relationship between traumatic spinal canal stenosis and the degree of neurological deficit is known for the cervical spine. However, this has not been proven for the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. During a period of 4 years, from 1996 to 1999, 1168 patients with a spinal injury were treated at our department, 473 of these by operation. Thirty-five were examined in a separate group. They showed a single fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine with stenosis of the spinal canal. All fractures were single burst fractures after blunt trauma. All patients were conscious and fully oriented at the time of admission and a thorough neurological examination could be performed. The fractures were diagnosed by conventional X-ray in two views and computed tomography (CT). Using the transverse CT scans in horizontal view, the sagittal diameter was measured and the degree of stenosis calculated in percent at the level of the fracture and one below and above. The group included 25 male and 10 female patients, with a mean age of 38 years (range: 17-61 years). Of the 35 patients, 19 (54.3{\%}) showed neurological deficits after spinal cord injury,and 16 (45.7{\%}) were without any neurological complications at the time of first admission to the hospital. There was no correlation between the extent of spinal canal stenosis and the degree of the neurological deficit. One patient with stenosis of 20{\%} suffered from neurological dysfunction, others with stenosis up to 80{\%} were without spinal cord injury. The average stenosis of the spinal canal was 49.6{\%} in cases with cord injury and 46.3{\%} in patients without neurological dysfunction. No correlation and no predisposing anatomical structures could be found between stenosis and neurological deficit.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: In contrast to the thoracolumbal spine, the cervical spine  bears a lower biomechanical load and, therefore, anterior stabilization of a fracture is a definitive procedure in the majority of cases. What remains the matter of choice is screw fixation in the body of the vertebra involved. This may be either monocortical or bicortical. In this study, we evaluate a group of patients in whom fractures of the lower cervical spine were treated using the CSLP monocortical system (Synthes). MATERIAL: We included 68 patients in whom complete radiographic data were available and the surgery was performed more than 6 months earlier. This group comprised 49 men and 19 women with the mean age of 37.6 years and range of 12 to 79 years. In the first stage, all patients were operated on from the anterior approach. In 11 (16.2{\%}) patients with type B or C injury, according to the AO classification, the procedure was completed by dorsal stabilization. The definite indication for surgery was any involvement of nerve structures or open fractures; kyphosis greater than 15 degrees, reduction by more that 50{\%} of the proximal edge of the vertebral body, narrowing of the spinal canal by more than 50{\%}, multiple wedge fractures and disc and ligament injuries associated with instability were considered conditional indications. METHODS: Any locked dislocation was reduced manually under X-ray guidance in the shortest possible time. Subluxations or fractures of the vertebral body were reduced by positioning the patient's body on the operating table. The standard procedure for subluxation management was distraction of the segment by applying a Caspar's distractor and subsequent microscopic discectomy up to the posterior longitudinal ligament. A tricortical bone graft was collected from the iliac crest. After its implantation, the distractor was released and the segment was fixed by a CSLP system (Synthes) with monocortical screws 14 mm long, usually used in a 2 + 2 configuration. In locked dislocation, in addition, the discission of the posterior longitudinal ligament and inspection of the dural sac were performed, and completed by dorsal stabilization with hook plates or a Cervifix fixator (Synthes) in one procedure under anesthesia. When the body of the vertebra was fractured, either partial or subtotal excision of it was carried out according to the type of fracture or when displaced fragments protruded into the spinal canal. A tricortical graft taken from the iliac crest was larger than in the treatment of subluxation but a plate was applied as in monosegmental fixation. In addition, the graft was fixed with special screws that had a porous surface and holes in the shank. Dorsal stabilization with hook plates or a Cervifix fixator was used for severe instability in type B or C injury. RESULTS: The normal range of cervical spine motion (flexion, extension, inclination, rotation) was found in 44 patients. Slightly limited movement (75{\%} to 90{\%} normal motion) was in 17 patients and seven were affected more seriously (50{\%} to 75{\%} normal motion). Of the 19 patients with neurological deficit, 13 showed improvement by 1, 2 or 3 grades of Frankel's classification in seven, four and two patients, respectively. The first signs of bone remodeling between the graft and covering plate, usually at the distal graft border, were found in 16 patients at 6 weeks and in the remaining 52 patients at 12 weeks. By 6 months postoperatively, all patients showed complete healing and incorporation of the tricortical graft. The cranial screws broke in one case (1.5{\%}) but this had no effect on the treatment outcome. No complication related to the surgical procedure occurred intraoperatively. DISCUSSION: The very good results achieved with the use of the CSLP monocortical system in this study (98.5{\%} fusion without broken screws or plates) are in agreement with relevant data reported in the Czech and foreign literature. The principal condition is a careful preparation of both the endplates of vertebral bodies and the graft. After insertion, this should stay in place without any tendency to extrude. If the graft is too long, it imposes an increased load on plates or screws that consequently act ventrally. CONCLUSION: Our experience and literature data suggest that the CSLP monocortical system is fully capable to stabilize the lower cervical spine after injury, supposing all procedures described above are completed. In more serious trauma and type B or C instability, the additional dorsal instrumented fusion is indicated.},

abstract = {The surgeon who treats patients with spine trauma must be able to apply a variety of management techniques to achieve optimal care of the patient. The anterior surgical approach is appropriate for some thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with neurologic deficit and without posterior ligamentous injury. Surgery is most often indicated for patients with incomplete deficit, especially those with a large retropulsed fragment, marked canal compromise, severe anterior comminution, or kyphosis {\textless}30 degrees. This approach provides excellent visualization of the anterior aspect of the dura mater for decompression. Reconstruction of the anterior body defect can be done with autograft, allograft, or a cage. Supplementation of the graft with anterior internal fixation helps prevent kyphosis. Clinical results demonstrate improved neurologic function in most patients as well as low pseudarthrosis rates. In patients with incomplete deficit, improvement in neurologic function usually can be expected with few complications.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to assess incidence, fracture type, and location of spine fractures due to falls. All emergency room CT requests during a time period of 26 months were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had fallen or jumped and were initially examined with multidetector CT (MDCT) were included. The MDCT studies were evaluated by two radiologists for trauma location, fracture type, and multiple level involvement. A total of 237 patients (184 males, 53 female, age range 16-86 years, mean age 42 years) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 203 vertebral fractures were seen in 127 patients. Burst fracture (n=78) was the most frequent type of trauma, usually located in the thoracolumbar junction (50{\%}). Also, compression fracture (n=52) was most common in the thoracolumbar junction (39{\%}). Posterior column fracture (n=52) was most frequently detected in the cervical spine (40{\%}). Multiple-level spine fractures were seen in 41 (32{\%}) of the injured patients, of which 12 (29{\%}) had fractures at noncontinuous levels. With increasing height the overall incidence of fractures increased, and burst fractures and multiple level spine fractures became more frequent. Age had no effect on fracture type or location. Spine fractures due to falls are common. Burst fracture is the most common fracture type and most frequently seen in the thoracolumbar junction. Multiple-level fractures were seen in 32{\%} of the cases, of which 29{\%} were seen at noncontinuous levels. Serious spine fractures are seen in all falling height and age groups.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective-retrospective study presents six cases of major bile duct injuries that occurred in our first 1000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Neuhaus et al. classification was used in this study. RESULTS: Bile duct injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified at 6 patients, on 2 patients the lesions were identified during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Four types of lesions were identified: 2 patients with peripheral bile leak from the cystic duct (A2), 1 patient with the complete occlusionn of the common bile duct (B2), 1 patient with lateral injury of the common bile duct(C2) and one with the right hepatic duct injury (C1), 1 patient with transection of the common bile duct (D1). A total of 6 patients with biliary injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated at our institution: a hepaticojejunostomy was performed in 2 patients, the sutures with the use of a T-tube was performed in 2 patients, occlusion the cystic duct was performed in 2 patients. One patient after primary hepaticojejunostomy required secondary hepaticojejunostomy because of the late stricture of the anastomosis. At this writing, all the patients are well and without problems after 1 to 4 years of follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSION: The small lateral injuries of the common bile duct and peripheral leakages can be treated endoscopically, the extended lateral injuries and complete bile duct transection require surgical repair. The treatment plan must be individualized for every patient, depending on the injury type and condition of the patient.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The study is an observational cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and the long-term outcome of thoracic or lumbar vertebral fractures in children. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The incidence of vertebral fractures in children is described as rare and the outcome as favorable. However, no studies evaluate the clinical and radiographic long-term outcome and if a fractured vertebra could be rebuilt during growth. METHOD: The incidence of vertebral fractures in children was evaluated through the radiographic archives. Twelve boys and 12 girls, aged 7-16 when sustaining the fracture, 21 one-column compression fractures and 3 burst fractures Denis type B, all without neurologic deficits, attended the follow-up. Primary treatment consisted of immediate mobilization without brace. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed 27-47 years after the injury. RESULTS: The annual incidence of thoracic and lumbar vertebral body fractures in individuals below age 16 was 0.07{\%}. Twenty-one individuals had, at follow-up, no subjective complaints, 3 had occasional back pain (Oswestry Scores 8, 22, and 26), 23 were classified as Frankel E, and 1 as Frankel D. The radiographic ratio anterior height/posterior height of the fractured vertebral body increased from 0.75 after injury to 0.87 at follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001). The posttraumatic kyphosis in the fractured region decreased in 8 individuals (33{\%}), all aged 13 or less at fracture. No increased disc degeneration was observed. CONCLUSION: Thoracolumbar vertebral fractures without neurologic deficits, sustained during growth, have a favorable long-term outcome. A modeling capacity, reducing the fracture deformity, exists at least in the youngest patients.},

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with thoracic spine fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, there were 37 compression fractures, 34 fracture-dislocations, 3 burst fractures and 3 burst-dislocations. Twenty-six patients had a complete lesion of the spinal cord, 14 sustained a neurologically incomplete injury, and 37 were neurologically intact. Fifty-three patients were treated nonoperatively and 24 treated operatively. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 2 approximately 15 years. None of the 26 patients with a complete lesion recovered any significant function. Of 37 neurologically intact patients, 13 had local pain although all of them remained normal function. Two of 14 patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal, 7 recovered some function and 5 did not recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the unique anatomy and biomechanics of the thoracic spine, the classification commonly applied to thoracolumbar fractures is not suitable for thoracic fractures. Fusion and instrumentation are indicated when the fractures are unstable, while patients with incomplete lesion of the spinal cord may be the candidates for supplemented decompression.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) in the thoracic and lumbar spine  is one of the region's important stabilizers. The precise diagnosis of PLC injury is required to evaluate the instability of the injured spine; however, the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnosing PLC injury has remained unclear. In this study, the authors compared preoperative MR imaging findings with direct intraoperative observation of PLC injury, clarifying the former's diagnostic accuracy regarding detection of PLC injury associated with the thoracic and lumbar fractures. METHODS: Data obtained in 35 patients who sustained thoracic or lumbar injuries were reviewed. There were 17 burst fractures, six flexion-distraction injuries, and 12 fracture dislocations. Each patient underwent MR imaging examination within 3 weeks of injury. Three radiologists independently evaluated sagittal MR images in a blinded fashion. The PLC-related information was retrospectively collected from each operative record. The diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging was analyzed by comparing imaging-documented intraoperative findings. The PLC injuries were detected in 23 patients (65.7{\%}) by direct observation during posterior spinal procedures. The diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging in detecting injury of the supraspinous ligament (SSL) and interspinous ligament (ISL) was 90.5 and 94.3{\%}, respectively. The specificity of T1-weighted MR imaging alone for depicting the SSL was significantly greater than T2-weighted imaging alone (p {\textless} 0.05). The overall mean kappa coefficient for MR imaging findings of PLC injury was 0.803, which indicated excellent interobserver reliability; that for ISL (0.915) was significantly greater than that for SSL (0.69) (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified a high diagnostic accuracy and interobserver reliability of MR imaging for PLC injury. The precise diagnosis of PLC injury is essential to determine the mechanical instability of the injured thoracic and lumbar spine, especially in differentiating unstable (three-column) burst fractures from the relatively stable (two-column) type. The authors conclude that MR imaging is a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate PLC injury associated with thoracic and lumbar fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Retrospective analysis of the vertebral body replacement system Synex in unstable burst fractures of the lumbar and thoracic spine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 22 months, we treated 30 patients (average age: 45, range: 20- 73 years, 16 females, 14 males) with unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar (n=20) and the thoracic (n=2) as well as lumbar (n=8) spine in two stages (primary dorsal transpedicular stabilization with fixateur interne under navigator guidance and intraoperative CT and secondary vertebral body replacement using the Synex). In three patients with osteoporosis we performed additional ventrolateral plate fixation. The complications of the operation were analyzed and the postoperative follow-up results were evaluated regarding stability, bony fusion, loss of correction, pain and neurological status. RESULTS: There was one postoperative instability, two transient neurological deteriorations and one case with seroma of the pleura. At follow-up examination (mean follow-up 14 months) an average loss of correction of 1.6 degrees was measured. Without osteoporosis a loss of correction of 5 degrees was observed in one case. In four osteoporotic patients without ventrolateral stabilization a mean loss of correction of 10 degrees was present. At the follow-up examinations a bony fusion was documented in 27 and stability in all patients. Most of the patients stated either no or only minor pains at follow-up. Only two patients with pain of medium degree had to take pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: The vertebral body replacement system Synex is a good technical possibility for a vertebral body replacement in unstable burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. With osteoporosis an additional anterior stabilization is to be recommended.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to develop an insight into the impairments in spinal fracture patients, operatively treated with an internal fixator, and also into their ability to participate in daily living, return to work and quality of life as defined by the World Health Organization. Nineteen patients operated for a type A fracture of the thoracolumbar spine (T9-L4) between 1993 and 1998 in the University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands, aged between 18 and 60 years, without neurological deficit were included in the study. Operative treatment consisted of fracture reduction and internal fixation using the Universal Spine System, combined with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting and dorsal spondylodesis. No ventral fusion operations, laminectomies or discectomies were done. Restrictions in body function and structure were measured on radiographs and in functional capacity tests, such as lifting tests and ergometry. Restrictions in activities were studied with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Spine Score and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Restrictions in participation/quality of life were analysed with the Short Form 36 (SF36) and described in the return to work status. The radiological results are comparable to the literature. The reduction of the anterior wedge angle was followed by a gradual partial loss of intervertebral angle and regional angle. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2-max) was reduced in only 8.3{\%} of the patients. Arm and trunk lift was within the normal range in 87{\%} and 80{\%} of the patients respectively, but only 53{\%} of the patients were able to perform a leg lift within the normal range. A mean RMDQ score of 4.0 positive items (SD 6.0) was found, and the mean VAS Spinal Score was 79.4 (SD 25.0), both better than in other series. No significant differences compared to the values of a comparable (healthy) age group could be identified in any variable of the SF36. A high correlation was seen between RMDQ, VAS Spine Score and the SF36 categories. No correlation was found between the anterior wedge angle and the regional angle on the one hand, and functional capacity tests or questionnaire scores on the other. Of the patients in paid employment before the trauma, 87{\%} had returned to work at follow-up. About 50{\%} of the patients had been obliged to change the intensity of their work or the kind of work they performed after the injury and treatment. In this matter, leg (muscle) performance seems a more important factor than overall condition (VO2-max). The results of the study indicate that patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures without neurological deficit, treated with dorsal instrumentation, perform like healthy people 3-8 years after injury, according to the RMDQ, VAS Spine Score and SF36 results. Physical capacity tests reveal that leg (muscle) performance seems a more important factor in impairment than arm lift or overall condition.},

abstract = {Although multiple studies have concluded operative decompression of a traumatically narrowed spinal canal is not indicated because of spontaneous remodeling, instrumental decompression is frequently used as part of the operative treatment of spinal fractures. To investigate the process of remodeling, we studied the diameter of the spinal canal in 95 patients with burst fractures at the thoracolumbar junction (T9-L2). To measure and compare the spinal canal's diameter we used either computed tomography (CT) scans or radiographs, made preoperatively, postoperatively, after 9 months and after 24 months. In lateral plain radiographs we found that the initial percentage of cases with bony canal narrowing preoperatively of 76.5 was reduced to 18.4{\%} postoperatively, to 8.2{\%} at 9 months, and to 2.4{\%} at 24 months. In CT scans in a selection of patients, the mean residual diameter of the spinal canal was 53{\%} preoperatively and 78{\%} at 24 months. The posterior segmental height increases during operation and decreases in the respective periods after operation. So ligamentotaxis can only play a role in the perioperative period. We conclude that a significant spontaneous remodeling of the spinal canal follows the initial surgical reduction. Two years after operation, bony narrowing of the spinal canal is only recognizable in 2.4{\%} of the patients on plain lateral radiographs. The remodeling of the spinal canal can be seen on plain radiographs, although not as accurately as on CT scans.},

abstract = {Prostaglandins (PGs) originate from the degradation of membranar arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). The prostaglandin actions in the nervous system are multiple and have been suggested to play a significant role in neurodegenerative disorders. Some PGs have been reported to be toxic and, interestingly, the cyclopentenone PGs have been reported to be cytoprotective at low concentration and could play a significant role in neuronal plasticity. They have been shown to be protective against oxidative stress injury; however, the cellular mechanisms of protection afforded by these PGs are still unclear. It is postulated that the cascade leading to neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, would be mediated by free radical damage. We tested the hypothesis that the neuroprotective action of cyclopentanone could be caused partially by an induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). We and others have previously reported that modulation of HO total activity may well have direct physiological implications in stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. HO acts as an antioxidant enzyme by degrading heme into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin that is rapidly converted into bilirubin. Using mouse primary neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that PGs of the J series induce HO-1 in a dose-dependent manner (0, 0.5, 5, 10, 20, and 50 micro g/ml) and that PGJ(2) and dPGJ(2) were more potent than PGA(2), dPGA(2), PGD(2), and PGE(2). No significant effects were observed for HO-2 and actin expression. In regard to HO-3 expression found in rat, with its protein deducted sequence highly homologous to HO-2, no detection was observed in HO-2(-/-) mice, suggesting that HO-3 protein would not be present in mouse brain. We are proposing that several of the protective effects of PGJ(2) could be mediated through beneficial actions of heme degradation and its metabolites. The design of new mimetics based on the cyclopentenone structure could be very useful as neuroprotective agents and be tested in animal models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease.},

This study aims to develop objective biomechanically based guidelines to quantify metastatic burst fracture risk. An experimentally validated finite element model of a human lumbar motion segment was used to simulate burst fracture. Through parametric analysis, the behavior of metastatically involved vertebrae was quantified and a formula to relate patient-specific variables to burst fracture risk defined. The equation-based guidelines were able to describe the mechanical behavior of the metastatically involved vertebral model (R2 = 0.97) reflecting the risk and mechanism of fracture. Vertebral density was found to influence the mechanism of burst fracture with respect to endplate failure. These analyses provide clinically feasible equation-based guidelines for burst fracture risk assessment in the metastatically involved spine.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A finite-element study and in vitro experimental validation was performed for a parametric investigation of features that contribute to burst fracture risk in the metastatically involved spine. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a three-dimensional poroelastic model of a metastatically compromised vertebral segment, to evaluate the effect of lytic lesions on vertebral strains and pressures, and to determine the influence of loading and motion segment status (bone density, pedicle involvement, disc degeneration, and tumor size) on the relative risk of burst fracture initiation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Finite-element analysis has been used successfully to predict failure loads and fracture patterns for bone. Although models for vertebra affected with tumors have been presented, these have not been thoroughly validated experimentally. Consequently, their predictive capabilities remain uncertain. METHODS: A three-dimensional poroelastic finite-element model of the first lumbar vertebra and adjacent intervertebral discs, including a tumor of variable size, was developed. To validate the model, 12 cadaver spinal motion segments were tested in axial compression, in intact condition, and with simulated osteolytic defects. Features of the validated model were parametrically varied to investigate the effects of tumor size, trabecular bone density, pedicle involvement, applied loads, loading rates, and disc degeneration using outcome variables of vertebral bulge and vertebral axial deformation. RESULTS: Consistent trends between the experimental data and model predictions were observed. Overall, the model results suggest that tumor size contributes most toward the risk of initiating burst fracture, followed by the applied load magnitude and bone density. CONCLUSIONS: The parametric analysis suggests that the principal factors affecting the initiation of burst fracture in metastatically affected vertebrae are tumor size, magnitude of spinal loading, and bone density. Consequently, patient-specific measures of these factors should be factored into decisions regarding clinical prophylaxis. Pedicle involvement or disc degeneration was less important according to the outcome measures in this study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical value of interbody cage systems in the surgical  treatment of unstable lumbar segment, and evaluate the biomechanical properties. METHODS: Ninety-seven cases were selected for operation by posterior lumbar interbody fusion with the BAK-cage or TFC device. Of the patients, 18 were diagnosed as lumbar disc degeneration disease (DDD), 37 as lumbar stenosis, 23 as spondylolisthesis, and 19 as unstable traumatic lesion. Thirty-six of them received additional posterior pedicle devices; 13 cases with severe mechanical back pain underwent anterior interbody fusion with the BAK-cage or TFC or interbod spacer, 4 of them underwent surgery once again. A new anterior Mesh-cage was used in spinal reconstruction for some patients, including 8 patients with thoracolumbar tumor, 2 with lumbar burst fracture, and 1 with osteoportic late collapse of a vertebral body. RESULTS: In the follow-up for an average of 21 months, 63 patients were available for review. The clinical results were excellent and good in 91.2{\%} of the patients who underwent posterior interbody cage fusion; the preoperative percentage of slip was corrected in 89{\%} of the patients with spondlyolithsis and in 100{\%} of the patients with traumatic dislocation. The satisfactory rate was 94.6{\%} in the patients with severe back pain who underwent anterior interbody cage fusion. The rate of union in the grafted area was 95{\%} at the 6th month after the operation. A preliminary experience showed that the clinical effect was obvious as the Mesh-cage was used in the patients with tumor, symptoms were relieved and motion ability was greatly improved in these patients. CONCLUSION: The interbody cage implant produces immediate stabilisation on unstable spinal segments, offers a conductive biomechanical environment for interbody graft healing by distraction properties and weight bearing function, and restores the normal interbody space and spinal column lordosis with satisfactory clinical effects on such diseases as DDD, traumatic lesion, osteoporotic late collapse of a vertebral body and spinal tumors.},

  abstract = {Clonus, presented behaviorally as rhythmic distal joint oscillation, is a common  pathology that occurs secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurological disabilities. There are two predominant theories as to the underlying mechanism of clonus. The prevailing one is that clonus results from recurrent activation of stretch reflexes. An alternative hypothesis is that clonus results from the action of a central oscillator. We present evidence that the mechanism underlying clonus in individuals with SCI is not solely related to muscle stretch. We studied electromyography (EMG) of the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral hamstrings, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris from subjects with clinically complete and clinically incomplete SCI during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing. Clonic EMG of the SOL, MG, and TA occurred synchronously and were not consistently related to muscle-tendon stretch in any of the conditions studied. Further, EMG activity during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing had similar burst frequency, burst duration, silent period duration, and coactivation among muscles, indicating that clonic EMG patterns occurred over a wide range of kinematic and kinetic conditions, and thus proprioceptive inputs. These results suggest that the repetitive clonic bursts could not be attributable solely to immediate afferent feedback such as recurrent muscle stretch. However, these results support the theory that the interaction of central mechanisms and peripheral events may be responsible for clonus.},

abstract = {A retrospective study was performed on the operative results following osteoporotic burst fractures with neurologic compromise. We sought to investigate the results of operative decompression and stabilization in patients with neurologic deficit as a result of an osteoporotic burst fractures. We examined the postoperative radiographic outcomes, level of disability, functional outcomes, and complications. Compression fractures of the anterior vertebral column secondary to osteoporosis and minimal trauma are a common clinical entity. These fractures are often effectively treated by nonoperative means. However, compressive failure of the middle vertebral column can lead to retropulsion of vertebral body fragments with significant canal compromise and neurologic injury. Treatment of these more severe injuries becomes more difficult and is less well established. Functional outcomes and disability from pain have not been examined. Previous reports on this subject have documented generally good results but have given few specific data regarding outcomes. We retrospectively report on a series of 10 patients, from 1995 to 1998, with osteoporotic burst fractures, which led to varying degrees of neurologic compromise. There were nine female and one male patient with a mean age of 76 years. Nine of the 10 patients presented more than 1 month following the onset of neurologic symptoms; 70{\%} of the fractures occurred at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2). Mean loss of anterior column height was 59{\%}, with significant kyphosis (mean 28 degrees) in nine of the 10 fractures. Mean canal compromise was 41{\%}. At presentation, seven patients were Frankel grade D and three were Frankel grade C. All patients were treated operatively with decompression and arthrodesis. Mean time to follow-up was 16 months. Six of the 10 patients had improvement of their Frankel grade postoperatively and one deteriorated neurologically. Seven of the eight surviving patients completed the Oswestry questionnaire with a mean score of 44{\%}, representing severe disability secondary to low back pain. The Physical Component score of the SF-36 was at or below the national mean for each patient. Complications were present in six of the eight surviving patients. Osteoporotic fractures are not benign. Careful evaluation for neurologic deterioration is warranted. Neurologic recovery occurred in six of the 10 patients; however, significant disability secondary to pain was common.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The primary reduction and stabilization of all types of injury to the thoracolumbar spine is currently performed from the posterior approach by an internal, transpedicular fixator. The exceptions are type A fractures, according to the AO classification, that can primarily be treated from the anterior approach. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of BAS-O bioceramic granules, inserted by transpedicular approach, on the development of post-operative kyphosis of the segments injured. MATERIAL: Between 1997 and 2001 we treated anterior spinal column fractures, using bioceramic granules in combination with an internal fixator, in 53 patients (40 men, 13 women: age 26 to 69 years; average, 42.3 years) at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the Third Faculty of Medicine and FNKV in Prague. However, only 42 patients (33 men, 9 women; age 28 to 67 years; average, 41.6 years) who had had the metal fixator removed more than six months previously were included in the study. The fixator was removed in the range of 10 to 24 months after the primary operation. The sample was divided into two groups; one with bioceramic material inserted in the body of the damaged vertebra (20 patients) and the other bioceramic granules implanted in both the vertebral body and the intervertebral space (22 patients). METHODS: In all the patients, the standard procedure included transpedicular application of Schanz's screws and an USS FS fixator (Synthes). If necessary, distraction of the segment injured and the correction of lordosis were carried out. Further transpedicular procedures to treat the anterior spinal column were as follows: If the vertebral body was injured without destruction to the intervertebral disc, a bent elevator was inserted through the vertebral foramen and the intervertebral joints were reduced. At the same time, a cavity for application of bioceramic granules was created. These were inserted, using a funnel and a pusher, in the anterior part of the injured body. If the fracture involved a destroyed intervertebral disc, the disc was removed, the vertebral end plate of the adjacent vertebra was perforated and bioceramic granules were inserted in both the vertebral body and intervertebral space. Subsequently, spongeous bone grafts were harvested from the ilium and massively applied to the previously decorticated transverse and articular processes. RESULTS: In the group of patients who had bioceramic granules inserted in only the vertebral body, the kyphotic angle was on average 10.36 degrees after injury and 2.86 degrees after surgery; therefore, a correction by 13.22 degrees was achieved. At 3 and 6 months after surgery, the kyphotic angle was 2.71 degrees and 2.68 degrees, respectively; at 3 and 6 months after fixator removal, it was 0.67 degree in both instances. In the group of patients with bioceramic granules implanted in both the vertebral body and intervertebral space, the kyphotic angle was on average 9.16 degrees after injury and 4.26 degrees after, surgery; therefore, a correction by 13.43 degrees was achieved. At 3 and 6 months after surgery, the kyphotic angle was -4.11 degrees and -4.00 degrees, respectively; at 3 and 6 months after fixator removal, it was 2.38 degrees and 2.44 degrees, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our results revealed differences between the patients who had bioceramic granules inserted in only the vertebral body and those who had them also in the intervertebral space. At 6 months after surgery, the first group showed the loss of correction per two segments to be 3.53 degrees on the average, whereas the second group had a loss of 6.70 degrees, i.e., twice as high. This may be explained by a more serious damage to the intervertebral disc in the latter group. Only small differences between the groups were found in the kyphotic angle at both 6 months after surgery and 3 to 6 months after fixator removal. This implied that, in both groups, the loss of correction occurred in the period up to 3 months after removal of the fixator. CONCLUSIONS: Bioceramic granules provide material for replacement of osseous tissue in the body of the vertebra as well as conditions necessary for bone restructuring. The loss of correction per segment is lower by about half in patients treated with bioceramic granules than in those who received a spongeous bone grafts.},

METHODOLOGY: In 2 years 70 patients with A1/A2 fracture were conservatively treated, 38 patients with A3/B/C injury were treated by internal fixtor. For evaluation 3 vertebral sections(Th5-10,Th11-L2,L3-5)were defined. Follow-up took place 1 year after implant removal or end of conservative treatment. RESULTS: The correction-loss was highest in thoracic, lowest in lumbar region. After conservative therapy,correction-loss was located to 3/4 in vertebra itself, after operative treatment especially in adjacent disc spaces. There was no general correlation to complaints. CONCLUSION: In consequence of these results A1/A2-fractures in the upper thoracic spine ({\textless}Th10) with kyphosis {\textgreater}15 degrees will be stabilized anteriorly, in other regions functional treated. A3-fractures of thoracic spine and thoracolumbar junction will be operated from anterior, in lower lumbar spine ({\textgreater}L3) from dorsal.

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to investigate the biomechanical in vitro influence of a new anchorage system for fixation of anterior stabilization devices and the possibility of using additional cement after screw insertion to compensate for poor bone quality. The incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures has increased nearly twofold in the last decade. Because of problems associated with anterior screw fixation such as loosening, mechanical failure, and the weakness of osteoporotic bone, current surgical treatments of vertebral body (VB) fractures are problematic. This is due to poor fixation strength of anterior screws in the adjacent segments. The aim of this study was to determine whether a new cemented and uncemented VB screw provides improved primary stability following placement of anterior instrumentation in cases of fracture. METHODS: The primary stability-related parameters of a new uncemented/cemented screw were compared with those of conventional monocortical screw fixation in a burst fracture model in which strut graft and anterior overbridging instrumentation were used. The use of the new uncemented screw improved the range of motion (ROM) of the stabilized spine in flexion-extension by approximately 22{\%}, in rotation by 20{\%}, and in lateral bending by 15{\%}. Additional cementation improved the ROM by approximately 41{\%} in flexion-extension, 32{\%} in rotation, and 30{\%} in lateral bending compared with conventional monocortical screw fixation. CONCLUSIONS: The new cannulated screw improves fixation strength and primary stability parameters. It is useful in the initial treatment of fractures in cases of poor bone quality and as a rescue device if previously inserted screws do not remain securely in place.},

METHODS: Thirty-six patients (16 male and 20 female patients) who required posterior thoracic instrumentation for spinal deformity (11 cases), neoplasm (15 cases), and traumatic injury (10 cases) were included in this study. One hundred sixty-four endplate screws were placed (mean 4.3/patient) to augment pedicle hooks for posterior thoracic instrumentation. The number of instrumented levels ranged from seven to 16. The positions of the screws in relation to the pedicle, neural foramen, spinal canal, and endplate were evaluated by assessing plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans (10 cases). Eighty-two screws (56{\%}) were in ideal position. Lateral pedicle wall perforation occurred with 51 screws (35{\%}). Three screws violated the medial wall and nine screws violated the superior or inferior walls of the pedicle. There were no clinical sequelae associated with any of the malpositioned screws. Adequate follow-up radiographic data were not available in five patients. The mean follow-up duration was 19.8 months (range 3-61 months). Two patients required revision surgery at 3 months and 18 months, respectively, because of hook/endplate screw displacement. There was also one case of an endplate screw fracture without hook displacement that was discovered during subsequent revision surgery. The remainder of the endplate screws and associated pedicles hooks maintained their original positions. There was no case of spinal cord, nerve root, pulmonary, or vascular injury. CONCLUSIONS: The placement of supplemental endplate screws in conjunction with thoracic pedicle hooks can be conducted safely.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was studied immunohistologically in specimens from lumbar disc herniation. The cultured disc cells also were examined to evaluate the significance of cyclooxygenase-2, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of lumbar disc herniation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cyclooxygenase-2 might be involved in the pathogenesis of lumbar disc herniation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prostaglandin E2 is one of the most important mediators contributing to pathogenetic components of lumbar disc herniation. Cyclooxygenase-2, the rate-limiting enzyme of prostaglandin E2 synthesis, has been identified and extensively investigated in other inflammatory diseases. However, the role of cyclooxygenase-2 in lumbar disc herniation has never been addressed. METHODS: Fifteen specimens from patients with lumbar disc herniation and five control discs from traumatic burst fracture were harvested. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was evaluated immunohistologically. The ability of cultured disc cells to produce prostaglandin E2 with inflammatory stimulus in the presence or absence of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 was investigated. At the same time, the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA of these cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was detected. The manner in which this prostaglandin E2 production could be suppressed by various doses of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor also was investigated. RESULTS: Immunohistologically, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was observed only in the lumbar disc herniation specimens. The cultured cells had a strong ability to produce prostaglandin E2 coinciding with cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA induction. A selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibited this prostaglandin E2 production in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Cyclooxygenase-2 might be involved in the pathogenesis of lumbar disc herniation through upregulation of prostaglandin E2 production.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of 12 patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures was conducted. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of ultrasound examination for posterior ligament complex injury in thoracolumbar spinal fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In posterior ligament complex injury of thoracolumbar spine fracture, the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis has been reported. Nevertheless the usefulness of ultrasound for diagnosis has not been studied, whereas diagnostic ultrasound has been applied in the musculoskeletal system. METHODS: Two healthy volunteers without a history of spinal trauma were recruited for pilot examination of the ultrasound procedure to access normal findings of the posterior ligament complex. This study investigated 12 thoracolumbar spine fractures. Four were flexion distraction injury; six were stable or unstable burst fractures; and two were simple compression fractures. Osteoporotic spine fractures were excluded from this study. Ultrasound was performed over the injured area by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist in addition to radiography and MRI. Five patients underwent operative procedures to stabilize the fractured spine. Imaging data and operative findings were correlated with ultrasound examination. RESULTS: In the patients who did not undergo surgery, agreement in diagnosis between MRI and ultrasound was moderate (5 of 7). Difficulty evaluating ligament status was encountered when the region of interest was the lower thoracic level (T10, T11, T12) because of long overlapping spinous processes. In the patients who underwent surgery, correlation between MRI, ultrasound, and operative findings was excellent, especially in diagnosing the status of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments. Nevertheless, it is impossible to visualize deep-seated structures (i.e., ligamentum flavum, deep muscles of the spine, and facet joint) with ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the excellent diagnostic ability of ultrasound to detect the status of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, especially in patients who undergo surgery. Although ultrasound examination appears to be less sensitive than MRI in predicting ligament status, the cost effectiveness of ultrasound and its use as an alternative to MRI in special situations (i.e., patients with pacemaker, ferromagnetic implant, or severe claustrophobia) should be emphasized. More clinical data concerning the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound examination should be addressed in future studies.},

abstract = {The dorso lumbar segment of spine (D10 to L2) is an unstable zone between fixed dorsal and mobile lumbar spine. A combined anterior and posterior approach with short segment stabilization was found most appropriate. Thirty cases were treated over a period of 4 years and 6 months. There were 26 male and 4 female patients with mean age of 32.6 years. L1 vertebra was fractured in 17 cases, D1 in 8 cases, D11 in 4 cases and D10 in one case. 14 cases had total neurological deficit, 9 cases had partial and 7 had no neurological deficit. We have used three column classification of Denis to assess the cases. Seven patients returned to regular physical work, 5 had restricted physical work, 5 remained in full time light job and 9 patients were unable to return to original job but did some work. Most had flaccid paraplegia but 4 patients were completely disabled due to spastic paraplegia. Neurological recovery occurred in all the patients with partial paralysis, and appeared to be dependent on initial kyphosis. The overall recovery rate varied from 50{\%} to 90{\%}. There is no correlation between canal compromise and severity of injury. Neurological injury occured at the time of trauma, rather than as a result of pressure of fragment in the canal. No strong conclusion could be drawn to say that the results of surgery were superior to non-operative treatment.},

METHODS: In the 166 SSI-TL cases included in this retrospective analysis, 37 had vertebral body burst fracture, 109 had vertebral body compression fracture (with compression to a degree over 50{\%}),14 had vertebral body fracture and dislocation and 6 had multilevel vertebral fractures or jumping fracture. In view of the spinal cord injury 59 belonged to Frankel grade A, 46 grade B, 42 grade C and 19 grade D. Posterior decompression, reduction and internal fixation were performed in 122 patients and the other 44 underwent anterior decompression, reduction and ilium bone grafting. RESULTS: Follow-up study for 3 to 18 month was conducted in 123 cases, in which RF screws cracking occurred in 4 cases, Harrington upper hook dislocation in 5 cases and Harrington rod cracking in 6, while the rest cases were free of theses incidents. In terms of the function recovery of the spinal cord, 88 cases showed improvement of the spinal cord and cauda equina of 1 to 3 Frankel grades, leaving only 35 lingering in grade A. CONCLUSION: Decompression should be performed at early stages of SSI-TL, and employment of various internal fixation instrument helps maintain and enhance spinal stability, preventing secondary lesion of the spinal cord and promoting the function recovery of the injured spinal cord.},

abstract = {Burst fractures of the fifth lumbar vertebra are rare, and there are only a few reports on this subject, which is characterised by its unique anatomical and biomechanical features. This retrospective analysis reports on ten patients whose fractures of L5 were stabilised with a short internal fixator in combination with a posterior fusion as well as transpedicular bone grafting. The average follow-up period was 22 months. Radiometric data were surveyed and compared to the functional results. The height of the fractured vertebra remained nearly unchanged throughout the course. Loss of lordosis of 4 degrees in the upper disc space and 4 degrees in the lower disc space were observed postoperatively. At the time of follow-up, the values of segmental lumbar lordosis were significantly below the preoperative level. The narrowing of the neural canal was reduced from 57{\%} to 28{\%} with the surgical intervention. However, there was no correlation between the functional and the radiological outcome. Neurological deficits were documented in two patients, which declined during the course. There were no severe postoperative complications. The results of the present study demonstrate that the described surgical procedure in fractures of the fifth lumbar vertebra does not promote an anatomic restoration of the fractured vertebra, nor of the segmental lordosis. However, the clinical results do not correlate with the radiological outcome. Nonoperative treatment with early mobilisation without external support seems to be the treatment of choice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An extracoelomic mini approach is introduced as a less invasive technique for surgery of the thoracolumbar area performed via the anterior approach. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with spinal pathological findings at the thoracolumbar junction were assessed. The reasons for surgery were as follows: burst fracture of the first lumbar vertebra (n = 5), degenerative disc at L1-L2 (n = 4), spondylodiscitis at L1-L2 (n = 8) and at T11-L1 (n = 1), pathological fracture of the first lumbar vertebra (n = 2), and pseudarthrosis at T11-L1 after failed reconstruction (n = 1). The anterior surgical procedure was performed via an extracoelomic mini approach. Intersomatic fusion was performed in 13 patients, corpectomy and bone grafting in 4, corpectomy and vertebral replacement with titanium cage packed with bone cement in 3, and removal of a cage in a failed fusion and bridging the defect with a strut bone graft in 1. Posterior instrumentation of the affected segment was performed in the same sitting. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation of operative time of the anterior procedure was 101.2+/-36.5 minutes. The mean blood loss during the anterior procedure was 724 +/- 483.5 ml. The procedure was safe. No pseudarthrosis was encountered, and the reconstructed bone was stable in the three patients in whom bone cement was used. CONCLUSION: The extracoelomic mini approach is less invasive; it results in less incisional morbidity, and it avoids opening the pleural and peritoneal cavities.},

abstract = {Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a large family of enzymes that can be divided into different classes based on structure. There has been considerable interest in the ability of GSTs to conjugate and inactivate endogenously derived reactive lipid peroxidation products that contain alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl moieties such as 4-hydroxyalkenals. One enzyme with prominent activity toward these substrates is human GST A4-4. Recently, we described a novel series of compounds termed A(2)/J(2)-isoprostanes (IsoPs) that are formed endogenously in humans from the free radical-initiated peroxidation of arachidonic acid. These compounds contain alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups and have structures similar to cyclooxygenase-derived PGA(2) and PGJ(2). Because of their chemical reactivity, these compounds may mediate tissue injury associated with oxidant stress. Herein, we report that the A-ring IsoP 15-A(2t)-IsoP (8-iso-PGA(2)) is efficiently conjugated to glutathione (GSH) by human GST A4-4 with a k(cat)/K(m) value of {\textgreater}200 s(-)(1) mM(-)(1). The k(cat)/K(m) value for conjugation of 15-A(2t)-IsoP by the homologous rat GST A4-4 is {\textgreater}2000 s(-)(1) mM(-)(1). Similar high enzyme activities were observed when PGA(2) was used as a substrate. In contrast, the human GSTs A1-1, M1-1, M2-2, P1-1, and T1-1 and rat GST T2-2 did not significantly metabolize 15-A(2t)-IsoP. These studies have therefore defined a potentially important route by which cyclopentenone IsoPs are metabolized that may serve as a mechanism for the inactivation of these highly reactive compounds.},

Twenty-six patients were treated non-operatively and 28 underwent surgery. All patients were followed up for l-12 years. Forty-three patients (79.6{\%}) have returned to their former employment or activity level. Four patients had experienced significant improvement but suffered from some limitation of activity. Five patients were unable to stand up and walk without support although they had some degree of improvement. Two remained completely paralyzed. There were no differences in neurologic function between patients treated non-operatively or operatively (P{\textgreater}0.05). The patients treated operatively had significantly less pain compared to the patients treated non-operatively (P{\textless}0.01). Because of the unique anatomy and biomechanics, fractures of the low lumbar spine are different from those in the remaining regions of spine. Most compression fractures are stable, and therefore conservative management is indicated. Surgery should be performed in those with burst fractures or flexion-distraction fractures, with severe spinal stenosis or kyphotic deformity, and fracture-dislocation.},

From 1997 to 2001, 60 consecutive patients with single-level thoracolumbar spinal injury, with no neurological impairment, were classified according to the Load Sharing scoring and were managed non-operatively. A custom-made thoracolumbosacral orthosis was worn by all patients for six months, and early ambulation was recommended. Several radiological parameters were evaluated; the Denis Pain and Work Scale was used to assess the clinical outcome. The average follow-up period was 42 months (range, 24 to 55 months). During this period the spinal canal occupation was significantly reduced. Other radiological parameters, such as Cobb's angle and anterior vertebral body compression, showed loss of fracture reduction, which was not statistically significant. However, the functional outcome was satisfactory in 55 of 60 patients with no complications recorded on completion of treatment. Load Sharing scoring is a reliable and easy-to-use classification for the conservative treatment and prognosis of thoracolumbar spinal fractures. Because of the three characteristics of the fracture site this classification can also predict the structural results of spinal injury, such as posttraumatic kyphosis, as well as the functional outcome in conservatively treated patients.},

We studied the inter-observer and intra-observer reproducibility of the Magerl (AO) classification using radiograms, CTs and MRIs of 53 patients. We compared this classification with the older and simpler Denis classification. Five observers classified the fractures, first using the radiograms and CTs and, 6 weeks later, with radiograms and MRIs. Three of the observers repeated the readings after 3 months. Three observers also classified the fractures according to Denis. Agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa test. The type (A, B, C) classification of the AO system was fairly reproducible with CTs. With MRI this was only moderate. Group subclassification of the types yielded higher kappa values, corresponding to substantial agreement. The agreement was, in general, better with the Denis classification, but the variance was higher due to the difficulty of finding proper categories for some injury patterns. Although the AO classification allows proper registration of all kinds of injury, the reproducibility, especially at the type level, is problematic. Use of MRI and better definition of the distinctive properties of the three different types may enhance the reproducibility of the scheme.},

abstract = {Current concepts of treating thoraco-lumbar burst-compression injuries are based  on posterior transpedicular fixation techniques which are angular stable. However, the long-term results of this approach are controversial due to inconsistent reports and due to a paucity of data on late outcome. In the present study we analyzed 50 patients retrospectively who had an unstable burst-compression injury at T 11-L 2 (type A 3 according to Magerl) without a neurological deficit. All fractures were stabilized by an internal fixator either with or without transpedicular spongiosa grafting. Patients were treated between 1991 and 1997. Follow-up times ranged from 36 to 103 months. Follow-up examinations collected occupational, subjective and clinical data (activity score, Hannover spine score) and included radiographic measurements. The latter were used to calculate the sagittal index (SI) which measures deformities of the fractured vertebral body, and the sagittal plane kyphosis (SPK) which additionally describes an eventual destruction of the affected intervertebral disc. Compared with the preinjury status, the percentage of subjects who were able to do physical labor was reduced by half at follow-up, and four times as many patients had a permanent disability. Correspondingly, activity scores and Hannover spine scores declined significantly. After the initial surgical correction SI remained stable until follow-up, whereas SPK decreased again towards pre-operative values indicating a progressive deformity of the intervertebral disc space. Clinical results did not correlate with radiographic results, and neither the time until follow-up nor the type of fracture n or the use of transpedicular bone grafting affected clinical or radiographic results significantly.},

Quantification of F2-isoprostanes has proven to be a major advance in assessing oxidative stress status in vivo. Central in the pathway of formation of isoprostanes are prostaglandin H2-like endoperoxides, which also undergo rearrangement in vivo to form E-ring, D-ring, and thromboxane-ring compounds. E2- and D2-isoprostanes also undergo dehydration in vivo to form reactive cyclopentenone A2- and J2-isoprostanes, which are susceptible to Michael addition reactions with thiols. Recently, we described the formation of highly reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes (now termed isoketals) as products of isoprostane endoperoxide rearrangement which readily adduct to lysine residues on proteins and induce cross-links at rates that far exceed other aldehyde products of lipid peroxidation. Isoprostane-like compounds (neuroprostanes) and isoketal-like compounds (neuroketals) are formed from oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid, which is enriched in the brain, and measurement of neuroprostanes may provide a unique marker of oxidative neuronal injury.},

abstract = {Due to the lack of an appropriate instrumentation system for minimally invasive procedures to treat spinal fracture, a new thoracoscopically implantable stabilization system was developed. This report describes the new implant design and implantation technique. In a biomechanical in vitro study, an anterior corpectomy model representing the worst case of burst fracture instability was simulated, and the primary stability parameters of the new system were evaluated in comparison to a dorsal stabilization system. With the interbody graft and fixation, the new system demonstrated higher stabilizing effects in flexion/extension and lateral bending and restored axial stability beyond the intact spine and the dorsal stabilization system. Considering all the advantages of the endoscopic procedure and this biomechanical characterization, the clinical trial is warranted; its usefulness has been demonstrated in more than 150 cases in a multicenter study to date.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Purpose of the study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of expanding a fractured vertebral body by transpedicular dilatation and stenting. 7 human cadaveric vertebral bodies from L2 to L5 underwent axia compression until a vertebral burst fracture was provoked. Then, by bilateral transpedicular approach, balloon-catheters were introduced, which were armed with stents, usually used for angioplasty. The catheters were inflated with radiolucent fluid and the stents expanded under radiologic control. After expansion, the balloon was deflated and removed, the stents resting inside the vertebral body, holding their inflated shape. Then, the resulting hole was filled with an injectable biodegradable calcium-phosphate. CT-scans were performed after destruction and after expansion. Morphology before and after expansion was judged, using 3-D reconstructions. Vertebral body strength was measured before destruction and after treatment with an Instron testing machine. RESULTS: Vertebral body shape could be restored. Also impressed central parts of the bony endplate could be elevated by using a convergent approach through the pedicles. There was no collapse of the vertebral body after removing the catheter-balloons The vertebral body strength could be restored up to a physiologic level. This procedure gives new perspectives in the treatment either of osteoporotic compression or traumatic vertebral fracture. By using CT-guided technique, it could be performed by a minimally invasive approach percutaneously.},

DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical experiment. SETTING: SCI and disorder center in a Veterans Affairs medical facility. PARTICIPANTS: Five healthy, able-bodied subjects and 4 subjects with SCI. INTERVENTION: A commercially available magnetic stimulator was used; a round magnetic coil was placed along the T9 spinous process. The intensity of the magnetic stimulation was 60{\%}, with a frequency of 20 Hz, and a burst length of 2 seconds for the gastric emptying protocol. Man Outcome Measures: Rate of gastric emptying and time required to reach gastric emptying half-time (GE(t1/2)) with and without FMS. Data fit into linear regression curve. RESULTS: Accelerated gastric emptying was achieved in both able-bodied and SCI subjects. The mean +/- standard error of mean of the GE(t1/2) at baseline and with FMS was 36+/-2.9 minutes and 33+/-3.1 minutes, respectively, for able-bodied subjects, and 84+/-11.1 minutes and 59+/-12.7 minutes, respectively, for SCI subjects. CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying was enhanced by FMS in able-bodied subjects and was greatly enhanced in SCI subjects. FMS can be a useful noninvasive therapeutic tool to facilitate gastric emptying in humans.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In a laboratory study, 21 human lumbar spine segments were used to  determine whether intraosseous pressure increases occur during axial-compressive loading conditions under two displacement rates. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intraosseous pressure rise is associated with burst fracture formation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures are high-speed injuries usually associated with neurologic deficit. An internal pressure rise has been implicated as a critical factor in burst fracture formation. The authors hypothesize that the internal pressure increases with increasing input velocity. METHODS: The internal pressure changes were measured in spine segments using two displacement rates: 10 mm/s (slow speed) and 2500 mm/s (high speed). Failure load and energy absorption were determined for both groups. The resultant fracture types were determined from postinjury radiographs. RESULTS: The initial peak internal pressure decreased from slow- to high-speed tests (P {\textless} 0.01). Overall peak pressure, failure load, and energy absorbed at failure were not significantly different. Slow-speed tests resulted in compression fractures, whereas high-speed tests resulted in burst and compression fractures. CONCLUSIONS: The current research did not support the current theory of burst fracture formation. There was a decrease in measured internal pressure from the slow- to high-speed groups, and burst fractures still were produced. The theory could be potentially modified to suggest that the nucleus entering the vertebral body acts as a wedge, splitting the vertebral body apart and enabling the bony fragments to be pushed into the canal space.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. OBJECTIVES: Forty-five consecutive cases of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures treated non-operatively were analyzed to correlate the extent of canal compromise at the time of injury with (i) the initial neurologic deficit and (ii) with the extent of neurological recovery at 1 year. The effect of spinal canal remodeling on neurological recovery was also analyzed. SETTING: University teaching hospital in south India. METHODS: The degree of spinal canal compromise and canal remodeling were assessed from computed tomography scans. The neurologic status was assessed by Frankel's grading. RESULTS: The mean canal compromise in patients with neurologic deficit was 46.2{\%} while in patients with no neurological deficit it was 36.3{\%}. The mean spinal canal compromise in patients with neurological recovery was 46.1{\%} and 48.4{\%} in those with no recovery. The amount of canal remodeling in patients who recovered was 51.7{\%} and 46.1{\%} in the patients who did not recover. None of these differences was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is no correlation between the neurologic deficit and subsequent recovery with the extent of spinal canal compromise in thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

METHODS: Twenty patients, scheduled for selective surgery, were randomly divided into the SMCI group (group A, 10 cases) and the control group (group B, 10 cases). SMCI 200 mg/kg was given intravenously in group A before starting the operation and at the time of rewarming respectively, and equivalent volumes of normal saline were administered to group B. The central venous blood samples were collected to measure the serum concentration of ET, PGI2, TXA2, and PGI2/TXA2 ratio. RESULTS: ET significantly reduced, while PGI2 and TXA2 obviously raised in both groups at the beginning (T1) of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (P {\textless} 0.05). After cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, ET in group B increased rapidly and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) and evidently higher than the corresponding value in group A 30 min after reperfusion (T3) till 24 hrs after reperfusion (T5). During reperfusion, PGI2 and TXA2 in group A decreased more rapidly than that of group B, while group A maintained higher PGI2/TXA2 ratio than that of group B. At T5, PGI2 and TXA2 in group A were significantly lower than those in group B, while PGI2/TXA2 ratio was higher than that in group B (P {\textless} 0.05). The serum ET level was obviously negatively correlated to PGI2/TXA2 ratio. The postoperative cardiac function recovered much better in group A than in that group B. CONCLUSION: SMCI can significantly reduce serum ET level, raise PGI2/TXA2 ratio, thus facilitate the postoperative cardiac function recovery following intracardiac surgery under CPB.},

  abstract = {Burst fractures may be stable or unstable, so the choice of treatment may be controversial; almost all cases are surgical type. Deciding on the best method and approach is difficult, due to the many possible options and the fact that good results are achieved in only 60-70{\%} of cases. The main problems to be resolved are the residual kyphosis or the recurrence due to loss of reduction. This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal and descriptive study of six patients two men and four women, mean age 46 years - who scored 7 or more points according to the load distribution classification, and were treated with vertebral shortening by a posterior approach and transpedicular fixation with INO plates. Follow-up was for a period of 2 years, and included evaluating pre- and postoperative stability and kyphosis among other data. The results showed a reduction in the mean fracture angle from 17 degrees preoperatively to 1 degrees postoperatively. Full stability was achieved in five patients, and incomplete stability in one patient, who recovered with the use of a corset. There was evidence of arthrodesis in all six patients within 9 months. The use of an anterior approach to treat burst fractures is well recognized; however, treatment with vertebral shortening using a posterior approach has the advantages of less bleeding, shorter surgical time and less residual kyphosis, as a result of putting together two flat surfaces of healthy bone. The residual kyphosis in the present series, after the 2-year follow up, was less than 1 degrees , which is lower than the 5 degrees - 10 degrees reported in the literature.},

Patients with compression received posterior instrumentation and underwent fusion; patients with burst received posterior instrumentation and later underwent anterior decompression and fusion. Eleven patients in the burst group had a neurologic deficit. Single dural tears were discovered in 7 patients during the posterior-instrumentation procedure. By the end of the follow-up period (mean, 34.4 months; range, 18-76 months), neither implant failure nor loss of correction had occurred. Combined mechanisms may go unrecognized and thereby result in increased morbidity and inappropriate treatment. Proper evaluation of the posterior elements is of utmost importance for the diagnosis of flexion-distraction injuries with vertebral body fractures. After diagnosis, treatment should be started with a posterior procedure.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro investigation of loading mechanisms in acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. OBJECTIVES: To assess the validity of the authors' hypothesis that anterior shear forces transmitted by the facet joints are responsible for causing the severe canal compromise associated with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thoracolumbar burst fractures created in the laboratory rarely match the severity of clinical cases. To date, no studies have examined in great detail the role of facet joint loading in the burst-fracture mechanism. An incomplete understanding of loading mechanisms may contribute to the controversies regarding management. METHODS: Nine human cadaveric motion segments were instrumented with strain gages and subjected to axial compression or axial impact coupled with an extension moment. Failure loads, strain information, and radiographs were collected. RESULTS: Fracture patterns characteristic of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures were observed in the three specimens tested with an extension moment. In this group, high strains were also recorded at the bases of the pedicles, indicating a probable site of fracture initiation. Specimens tested in a neutral orientation experienced crush fractures without an increase in interpedicular distance. Strain patterns were more uniform in this group. CONCLUSIONS: The severity and clinical relevance of the injuries sustained by the specimens tested in extension suggest that facet joint loading plays a critical role in the acute thoracolumbar burst-fracture loading mechanism. Fracture patterns and strain concentrations are in agreement with clinical observations as well as past experimental studies.},

Identification of all contents within the dural sac was completed; however, the main focus was the cauda equina and lumbar region. In addition to scope dissection, radiographs and histological preparations were used to identify structures, tissue types, and any possible pathology. Discrete intrathecal ligamentous bands were observed in all cadavers examined. They were found randomly binding the dorsal nerve roots of the cauda equina to the dura. Occasional binding of the ventral nerve roots to the dorsal roots was observed. Histological examination demonstrated a dense collagen ligament varying between 0.13 and 0.35 microm in thickness and from 3 mm to 3.5 cm in length. The average number of ligaments found per cadaver was 18. These ligaments displayed a broad base attachment to the nerve root or dura of approximately 3 mm. Looping of the nerve roots associated with these ligaments was seen in one cadaver with a burst fracture. Electron microscopic studies of these ligaments demonstrated similarities to denticulate ligaments. It is suggested that the intrathecal ligaments represent remnants from fetal development of the denticulate ligaments.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the age of onset of hypercortisolism influences its effects on bone mass and turnover. SUBJECTS: 10 with childhood-onset (co) and 18 with adulthood-onset (ao) Cushing's disease (CD); 28 age-, sex- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy subjects served as controls. STUDY DESIGN: Open, cross-sectional controlled. MEASUREMENTS: Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine, serum osteocalcin (OC), and urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen (Ntx) levels. RESULTS: BMD at lumbar spine was significantly lower in all CD patients than in controls (Z score, -2.3 +/- 0.1 vs. -0.2 +/- 0.01; P {\textless} 0.001). co-CD and ao-CD patients had similar values of bone mass when expressed as Z score (-2.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.1 +/- 0.2; P = 0.27) or as BMD (0.728 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.03 g/cm2; P = 0.25). In particular, osteoporosis was observed in 16 patients (57.1{\%}) [eight adolescents (80{\%}) and eight adults (44.4{\%})] and none of the controls; osteopenia was found in two co-CD patients (20{\%}) and none of the healthy adolescents, 10 ao-CD patients (55.6{\%}) and four healthy adults (14.3{\%}) (chi2 = 7.87, P {\textless} 0.01; chi2 = 2.99, P = 0.09, respectively). In co-CD and ao-CD patients, serum OC levels were similar and significantly lower than in controls (P {\textless} 0.01); urinary Ntx levels were significantly higher than in controls (P {\textless} 0.001) and were significantly higher in co-CD than in ao-CD patients (P {\textless} 0.001). No significant correlation was found between urinary cortisol levels, serum cortisol and age and lumbar Z score values, while a significant correlation was found between Ntx levels and disease duration (r = 0.434; P = 0.021) and plasma cortisol (r = 0.440; P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Cushing's disease causes bone loss and abnormalities of bone turnover both in childhood-onset and in adulthood-onset patients. A strict follow-up of bone mass and turnover is mandatory in all patients with Cushing's disease to prevent fractures later in life and specific treatment for bone loss is strongly suggested.},

From the point of view of impact, pressure changes and spinal cord injuries, the relationship between the type of spinal fracture and the severity of spinal cord injuries were analyzed and some experimental data were provided for early evaluation of severity of spinal cord injuries. METHODS: An experimental model of spinal burst fracture was made with Type BIM-I bio-impact machine and techniques of high velocity vertical loading in static pattern and stress shielding were adopted. Vertebral sections T10-L4 taken from fresh cadavers were impacted and pressure changes in the spinal canal were observed. The types and severity of spinal fracture were studied with gross and radiography examination. RESULTS: Great positive pressure wave (wave A) in the spinal canal of the 4 vertebral specimens with burst fracture was recorded. The peak value of pressure was correlated with the severity of posterior column injuries. Generally, the peak value of pressure was low in the samples with posterior column injuries, but high in the samples without injuries. The predominant features of fractures were burst fractures of vertebral body and severe destruction of the skeletal and fiber structure of the spinal canal. Positive and negative pressure waves (wave B) were recorded in 2 vertebral samples in which no significant abnormal changes were found by radiography examination, however, a little liquid effusion in the vertebral body was found by gross examination. CONCLUSIONS: The type of pressure wave in the spinal canal is related to the deformation or the destruction of the spinal canal structure. The peak value of the pressure is non-linearly related to the obstruction in the spinal canal, but related to posterior column injuries.},

RESULTS: The stenotic ratio significantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) from the discharge (range: 12.3{\%} to 74.5{\%}, average: 26.2{\%}) to the final follow-up (range: 5.4{\%} to 46.5{\%}, average: 19.2{\%}), but there were no differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) of stenotic ratio improvement among the patients untreated, and treated nonoperatively and operatively, or among the patients with different degree of neurological deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Significant remodelling of the spinal canal develops after thoracolumbar burst fractures. Nonoperative management may be taken into account for treatment of neurological intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A new concept of surgical stress has been proposed that consists of both aggressiveness of operation and systemic reactions to an operation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have investigated a possible modulation of such systemic reactions to operation and have demonstrated the following 3 points: (1) coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are independently activated during hepatectomy and such activation can be modulated by protease inhibitors such as nafamostat mesilate and antithrombin III; (2) elevated thromboxane A2 during hepatectomy is characterized in the prostanoid system, the elevation of thromboxane A2 is inhibited by thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, and postoperative liver injury is reduced; (3) cytokine response induced by hepatectomy is modulated by preoperative administration of methylprednisolone, leading to possible prevention of bacterial translocation. Therefore, modulating systemic reactions to hepatectomy may be important for successful minimally invasive hepatectomy. Another important option for minimally invasive hepatectomy is the use of operative procedures such as laparoscope or thoracoscope. We have investigated the usefulness of a laparoscopic hepatectomy from the standpoints of early and long-term outcome after hepatectomy. Laparoscopic hepatectomy, which is a difficult and dangerous procedure, can be a feasible option and can result in better short-term outcome and a similar long-term outcome after hepatectomy when compared with conventional open hepatectomy. Therefore, the laparoscopic approach is also a viable option for minimally invasive hepatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of systemic reactions to the operation itself and laparoscopic hepatectomy may be new strategies for performing minimally invasive hepatectomy.},

abstract = {The short segmental pedicle screw device is widely used for the decompression of  neural elements and reduction of normal anatomy. Many biomechanical studies concerning proper decompression are available. However, no study has determined the optimal device adjustment for reduction of the burst fracture to the normal anatomy. In this study, cadaveric thoracolumbar spine specimens (T11-L3) with L1 burst fractures were studied. A pedicle screw device was attached to the pedicles of the T12 and L2 vertebrae. Spinal postural changes were determined due to a set of eight clinically relevant adjustments of the device. The adjustments were combinations of axial translation (distraction/compression) and extension. The adjustments caused varying changes in spinal posture. The sequence of applying the translation and extension had no effect on the spinal posture changes. The adjustment combining 5 mm distraction with 6 degrees extension brought the burst fracture closest to the intact state, compared to all other adjustments. With this adjustment, on average the spine became 0.9 mm compressed and 2.0 degrees lordotic, compared to the intact. The results of the study show that the device adjustments of axial translation and sagittal angulation can be applied in any sequence, with the same results. The combination of 5 mm distraction with 6 degrees extension was the device adjustment that produced the closest anatomical reduction.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE: To examine disc integrity at levels adjacent and next adjacent to the fractured vertebra and to determine if the disc injury can be revealed by radiographs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thoracolumbar burst fracture is one of the most common spinal injuries. A fractured vertebra is easy to recognize, but the associated disc injuries are less well known. The disc injury may not be apparent in radiographic images. Quantitative discomanometry, which measures disc pressure and the injected volume, has been found to detect disc injury. METHODS: Nine specimens (T11-L3) with L1 burst fracture included adjacent discs (T12-L1 and L1-L2) and next-adjacent discs (T11-T12 and L2-L3) and were examined with radiographs and quantitative discomanometry, before and after the burst fracture. Statistical analyses were used to determine if the nine quantitative discomanometry parameters, in each of the four discs, were changed by the burst fracture and if the two next adjacent discs sustained different injuries. RESULTS: After the burst fracture both the adjacent discs were shown to be injured by both radiographic and quantitative discomanometry examinations. Whereas both next-adjacent discs were found to be uninjured by radiograph examination, the quantitative discomanometry found the lower next-adjacent disc (L2-L3) to be injured. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative discomanometry was successful in finding disc injury, where the radiographs found none. The lower level, next adjacent disc is susceptible to injury during the burst trauma.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: On Saturday 13 May, 2000 at about 15:30 h, the Dutch city of Enschede was struck by the explosion of a midtown firework depot. Twenty-two people were killed and almost 1,000 people were wounded. A complete district with 1,000 houses was destroyed. In total, 527 victims were treated in one of the regional hospitals, 76 (14{\%}) of whom were admitted and 451 (84{\%}) were treated as outpatients. Of the clinically treated victims, 11 patients were triaged as T1 and needed immediate intervention, 63 patients were triaged as T2 where treatment within six hours was indicated, and two T3 patients did not need urgent treatment. The outpatients mainly suffered secondary blast injuries to the head and extremities due to flying debris. Of the 11 T1 patients, 10 underwent acute surgery; intervention radiology was performed in one patient. The injuries of the severely wounded T1 patients consisted of penetrating thoracic, abdominal and skull injuries, as well as blunt abdominal trauma and compound fractures. Two patients from the disaster area underwent acute vascular surgery for acutely burst aortic aneurysms. The in-hospital trauma care was characterised by the spontaneous arrival of a large number of extra medical personnel. The regional distribution of the trauma patients was adequate. The regional capacity of the emergency rooms, IC-units and operating facilities proved to be sufficient. Routing of lightly-wounded patients was found to be important. The communication in all phases of the disaster management appeared to be poorly structured. CONCLUSION: During the initial trauma care, the routing of vast numbers of ambulant, lightly-wounded patient, as well as extra doctors and nurses, needs careful planning.},

abstract = {Bone fragments in the spinal canal after thoracolumbar spine injuries causing spinal canal narrowing is a frequent phenomenon. Efforts to remove such fragments are often considered. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of surgery on spinal canal dimensions, as well as the subsequent effect of natural remodelling, previously described by other authors. A base material of 157 patients operated consecutively for unstable thoracolumbar spine fractures at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg during the years 1980-1988 were evaluated, with a minimum of 5-years follow-up. Of these, 115 had suffered burst fractures. Usually the Harrington distraction rod system was employed. Patients underwent computed tomography (CT) preoperatively, postoperatively and at follow-up. From digitized CT scans, cross-sectional area (CSA) and mid-sagittal diameter (MSD) of the spinal canal at the level of injury were determined. The results showed that the preoperative CSA of the spinal canal was reduced to 1.4 cm2 or 49{\%} of normal, after injury. Postoperatively it was widened to 2.0 cm2 or 72{\%} of normal. At the time of follow-up, the CSA had improved further, to 2.6 cm2 or 87{\%}. The extent of widening by surgery depended on the extent of initial narrowing, but not on fragment removal. Remodelling was dependent on the amount of bone left after surgery. The study shows that canal enlargement during surgery is caused by indirect effects when the spine is distracted and put into lordosis. Remodelling will occur if there is residual narrowing. Acute intervention into the spinal canal, as well as subsequent surgery because of residual bone, should be avoided.},

As an air-leak model, a rat lung was used in which a standard incision was made and the burst pressure for ABHS and FG was measured. The average burst pressures at time 0 for the FG and ABHS groups were 30.8+/-15.2 and 77.5 +/-19.1 mmHg, respectively. At Day 3, the value of ABHS (76.3 +/- 15.8 mmHg) was still significantly higher (P{\textless}0.05) than that of FG (60.0 +/- 21.9 mmHg). At Day 7, no statistical difference was observed between the FG group(71.2 +/- 18.6 mmHg) and the ABHS group(88.8 +/- 11.7 mmHg). Histological examination of the incision at Day 14 revealed that neither sealant was not visible at the incision site, and there was no evidence of adverse tissue reaction.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: A group of 120 patients was evaluated with acute injury of  Th-L spine who were operated on from posterior approach with the use of Dick AO fixator or USS fixator in the period of 1991-1996. MATERIAL: In the period of 1991-1996, 128 patients were operated on with the acute injury of Th-L spine. Evaluated were 120 patients: 81 men (67.5{\%}) of average age 40.1 years (age range, 16-74 years) and 39 women (32.5{\%}) of average age 35.4 years (age range, 15-66 years). Posterior stabilization using the internal fixator was combined with posterolateral or posterior interarticular fusion. In comminuted fractures of the vertebral body transpedicular cancellous bone grafting was performed and starting for 1995 also intercorporal transpedicular fusion. METHODS: The evaluation covered location and type of fractures, injury of other levels of the spine, other associated injuries, neurological symptomatology prior to the surgery and 3 months after the surgery, duration of surgery and of image intensifier exposure, peroperative and early postoperative complications, radiograph evaluation of the degree of reduction, the loss of correction after 12 months and after the hardware removal. RESULTS: Evaluated were 120 patients. Average interval after the surgery at the time of the evaluation was 43.7 months (range, 24-93 months). The injury was caused in 82 cases (68.3{\%}) by a fall from height, in 26 cases (21.7{\%}) by a car accident and in 12 cases (10{\%}) by another cause. Associated injuries included: calcaneus fracture 18 times, the fracture of ankle 4 times, pelvis fracture 4 times, other fractures 18 times. In 89 cases the injury involved only one vertebra, i.e. one level, 31 cases were multi-level injuries. The angle of the kyphosis of vertebral body was on average 21.8 degrees. Patients with neurological symptoms were on average operated on 2-12 hours after the admission, other patients were operated on in the interval between 5 hours and 7 days. Bilateral transpedicular cancellous bone grafting was performed in 106 affected vertebrae, the canal was revised in 27 injured vertebrae. The surgery took on average 172 minutes (range, 62-430 minutes). Image intensifier exposure lasted on average 2.4 minutes. Average blood loss was peroperatively estimated at 725 ml, postoperatively on average at 815 ml. Postoperative complications: healing of the wound per secundam 6 times, thromboembolic complication in 9 cases--never fatal, pneumonia 3 times, uroinfection 5 times. The total number of these complications was about 8{\%}. Vertebral body was completely restored in 72 cases, incompletely in 34 cases (up to 5 degrees deficit). The correction of kyphosis achieved was on average 6.5 degrees. After 12 months the correction loss with the fixator in place was on average 2.5 degrees. After the removal of the fixator the average correction loss was 5.5 degrees. In 2 cases there occurred a significant re-dislocation which required revision surgery. Transpedicular screws broke 6 times in the total of 4 patients, fixator loosened in 2 cases. DISCUSSION: Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar spine is indicated in unstable injuries and all injuries with neurological lesion and a proved compression of spinal canal. Decompression of the spinal canal is often achieved by reduction, lordotization and distraction. In other cases revision of the canal is indicated. Stabilization is performed by means of a transpedicular internal fixator. Part of the surgery is posterior fusion. The defect in the reduced body is treated by transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The affected inervertebral disc must be treated by intersomatic fusion. Anterior operation is indicated as a complementary one. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Absolute majority of injuries of thoracolumbar spine may be treated from the posterior approach. In this it is necessary to restore the stability of the anterior column. An indispensable part of the operation is a flawless posterior fusion. 2. Some types of injuries require a complementary anterior approach in the first or second step. This applies mainly to the injuries with a defect of anterior column evaluated on the basis of classification after Gaines. 3. A primary isolated anterior approach to the treatment of the injury of Th-L spine is not in our view suitable as a routine.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of different adjustments applied by the pedicle screw fixation device on the stability of the spine-device construct. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screw devices are widely used to accomplish spinal reduction and provide stability to an injured spine. In previous biomechanical studies the stability of the spine-device constructs has been examined for many devices. However, no study has quantitatively assessed the associations between the device adjustments and the stability of the construct. METHODS: Five-vertebrae human cadaveric specimens with burst fracture at L1 vertebra were studied. Pedicle screw fixation device was attached to the T12 and L2 vertebrae. Five device adjustments (pure compression, pure distraction, pure extension, a combination distraction-extension, and neutral posture) were studied. Multidirectional flexibility test was performed when intact, after burst fracture, and after each device adjustment to document spinal stability. RESULTS: The construct stability had a complex association to the device adjustment. For example, the maximum flexion and extension stabilities were achieved by pure compression and distraction-extension combination adjustments, respectively. Pure distraction and pure extension adjustments decreased the construct stability. CONCLUSIONS: The device adjustments affected the spinal construct stability differently in different directions. Although pure compression provided the most stability in most directions, the combined distraction-extension adjustment may be more suitable considering the neural decompression also.},

abstract = {AIM: We report our experience with the first 1000 patients with non-traumatic low back pain (LBP) without radiculopathy undergoing limited sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of plain radiography. METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 1998, 1042 patients with low back pain unresponsive to conservative treatment were examined using a limited MR protocol comprising sagittal T1-weighted and STIR imaging. Plain radiographs were not performed. RESULTS: Malignancy, infection, vertebral fracture, spondylitis, pars defects and cord tumours were detected in 20{\%}. Of the 82 osteoporotic vertebral fractures detected, 51 (62{\%}) were recent and 31 had normal marrow signal indicating that they were old. Eighty pars defects were identified, 45(56{\%}) had spondylolisthesis, 29(37{\%}) were undisplaced and 6 (7{\%}) had pars oedema only. Neoplastic disease was found in 17(8{\%}) of which none was suspected before imaging. Benign neoplastic diseases such as vertebral AVM/haemangiomata were excluded. Twenty-one patients had a variety of disorders including ankylosing spondylitis (7), large vessel aneurysm (3), discitis (2), ovarian cyst (2), sequestered disc (2), sacral insufficiency fracture (2) and one patient each with burst fracture, retroperitoneal haematoma and a previously unsuspected horseshoe kidney. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with LBP are best assessed clinically and imaging is usually not required. In patients with worrying symptoms, MRI with a limited protocol detects a greater number of abnormalities than previously reported studies using plain radiographs and has replaced plain radiography in our hospital. We report our experience with the first 1000 patients and highlight issues such as protocols, detection rates and communication issues.},

abstract = {Management of lumbar burst fractures remains controversial. Surgical reduction/stabilization is becoming more popular; however, the functional impact of operative intervention is not clear. The purpose of this study was to assess health-related quality of life and functional outcome after posterior fixation of lumbar burst fractures with either posterolateral or intrabody bone grafting. Twenty-four subjects were included. Radiographs and computed tomography scans were evaluated for deformity (kyphosis, vertebral compression, lateral angulation, lateral body height, and canal compromise) postoperatively, at 1 year, and at final follow-up (mean 3.2 years). Patients completed the SF 36 Health Survey and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire at final follow-up. Significant improvement was noted in midsagittal diameter compromise, vertebral compression, and kyphosis. The difference observed between the respondents mean scores on the SF 36 was not significantly different from those presented as the U.S. national average (p = 0.053). Data from the Oswestry questionnaire indicated a similarly high level of function. Overall, we found posterior spinal instrumentation to correlate with positive functional outcome based on both general health (SF 36) and joint-specific outcome scales (Oswestry). Posterior instrumentation provides sound canal decompression, kyphotic reduction, and maintains vertebral height with minimal transgression and long-term sequelae. In cases of severe initial deformity and neurologic compromise, intrabody bone grafting is most certainly indicated; the additional support provided by a posterolateral graft may also prove beneficial as an adjunct.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Priming of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) response has been implicated in the activation of oxidative burst and tissue injury in patients with septic shock and acute renal failure (ARF). This study evaluated whether hemofiltration (HF) removes substances able to enhance the oxidative burst of PMNs. METHODS: Chemiluminescence (CL) priming activity induced by sera and ultrafiltrates of seven patients with septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and ARF (ARF/HF group) and of 10 uremic stable patients (Control/HF group) was evaluated on normal human PMNs stimulated with bacterial formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Patients submitted to HF were studied by determining blood and ultrafiltrate interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and CL priming activity at the beginning (T0), and after four hours (T4) of treatment. RESULTS: Preincubation of normal human PMNs with sera and ultrafiltrates from septic patients induced a potent priming of CL activity in subsequent FMLP stimulation. In the ARF/HF group, the prefilter blood concentrations of IL-8 and CL PMN-priming activity significantly decreased during the four hours of HF treatment, with a loss of IL-8 in the ultrafiltrate of 6930 (median, range 4292 to 9282) ng per four hours. PAF detected in the ultrafiltrate and associated with the membrane (7.3 ng, range 1.45 to 9.89) was minimal. In the ARF/HF group, a significantly positive correlation between CL PMN-priming activity and IL-8 concentrations was observed. The CL priming activity in blood and ultrafiltrates was reduced to 55 and 46{\%} by preabsorption with monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-IL-8. In contrast, the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2170 did not affect CL priming activity. In the control/HF group, the CL PMN-priming activity was significantly lower than in the ARF/HF group and was independent of IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Sera from septic patients demonstrate an enhanced CL priming activity on PMNs. This activity is reduced by ultrafiltration and is due, at least in part, to ultrafiltered IL-8.},

Thus, the concept of instability is further defined. The authors presents 33 cases of burst type thoracolumbar fractures treated by transpedicle instrumentation using the following systems: Malaga vertebral fixator 1,2 (MVF), Omega 21. Follow-up was obtained after rom 1 to 9 years. Results were: clinical-radiographic criteria (1. fusion, 2. deformity, 3. pain, 4. neurologic function). There was remodeling of the spinal cord canal in cases operated on. The authors conclude that a correct evaluation of instability of burst fractures and the consequent treatment of choice (transpedicle fixation) allows for a high favorable index of the functional capacity in these patients.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study investigated the incidence, predictions, and treatment principles of greenstick lamina fractures in lumbar burst fractures. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of dural tears in lumbar burst fracture with greenstick lamina fracture and to find out if any specific clinical and radiographic factors or intraoperative pathologic findings are predictive of dural tears and nerve root entrapment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A retrospective review was conducted on 45 patients with 47 lumbar burst fractures treated operatively. Ages ranged from 15 to 70 years (average, 33 years). The duration of follow-up ranged from 32 months to 8 years (average, 52 months). METHODS: All clinical charts and radiologic data of these patients were reviewed. Age, sex, etiology, and all the radiologic parameters were analyzed for their association with greenstick lamina fracture and dural tear. Student's t test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Greenstick lamina fracture occurred in 20 (42.5{\%}) of 47 burst fractures. Dural tear was detected in 9 (19{\%}) of 47 burst fractures and was predominantly higher in L3 (6 of 9 burst fractures). According to multiple logistic regression analysis of the data, a 20{\%} increase in the interpedicular distance gives a 79{\%} probability of greenstick lamina fracture. The distance between the edges of greenstick lamina fractures was obviously higher in fractures with dural tear. Neurologic status was completely normal before surgery in three of the patients with dural tear and nerve root entrapment. CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to detect dural tear and nerve root entrapment in greenstick lamina fracture before surgery. Therefore, if there is any suspicion of such an occurrence, it should be the rule to begin with posterior approach and use the open book technique to expose the dura safely before any reduction maneuver.},

abstract = {Previous studies of animals observed a phenomenon of adaptation of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and found that the phenomenon was mediated to a large extent by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. The present study investigated DPOAE adaptation in humans. The following stimuli were used: f2/f1 = 1.2; f2 = 2, 4, or 5.65 kHz; L2 = 50-65 dB SPL re 20 microPa rms, L1 - L2 = 0-15 dB, where L1 and L2 represent levels of the f1 and f2 tones, respectively; duration of two-tone burst = 5.5 s; interburst gap = 20 or 30 s; number of repetitions = 40 or 64. We analyzed the 2f1 - f2 DPOAE as a function of time using a method of heterodyne envelope detection. The subjects were 20 humans aged from 15 to 54 years (median = 21 years) with normal hearing. We observed that (1) humans exhibited DPOAE adaptation phenomenon; (2) the time course of DPOAE level was characterized by a 2-exponential function; (3) distributions of the fast and slow time constants were well separated with their median values being 69 ms and 1.51 s, respectively; (4) distributions of the magnitudes of the fast and slow adaptation components were largely overlapped with their median values being 0.65 and 0.40 dB, respectively; and (5) the combined magnitude of the adaptation ranged from 0.4 to 3.0 dB with a median of 1.10 dB. To our knowledge, the present study is the first published article to describe adaptation of DPOAE in humans. These results should help advance the basic knowledge of human cochlear mechanics operating under the control of the MOC feedback system and contribute to the development of practical applications such as identifying people at high risk of acoustical injury and a clinical test of the functional status of the MOC system.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The neural spaces of thoracolumbar burst fractures were investigated in an in vitro biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate encroachments of spinal canal diameter and intervertebral foramen area as functions of where the center of rotation is located during flexion and extension. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Decompression of the neural spaces is important for the recovery of neural function in a patient with a burst fracture injury. A few biomechanical studies have documented the decompression of the neural elements by adjustment of posterior fixation devices. However, the device adjustments have been device specific and ill defined. No study has investigated the neural decompression phenomenon with precisely defined multiple adjustments. METHODS: Burst fractures were produced at L1 vertebra in nine T11-L3 human spinal segments. Specimens were flexed and extended around five different centers of rotation located in the mid-L1 plane. The spinal canal diameter and intervertebral foramen area encroachments were quantified in maximum flexion and extension around each center of rotation using lateral radiographs. RESULTS: The average canal encroachment of 42.6{\%} changed in flexion (32.2-48.5{\%}) and extension (36.3-44.2{\%}) by location of the center of rotation. The average intervertebral foramen area encroachment was decreased to a greater extent more often in flexion than in extension because of where the center of rotation was located. CONCLUSIONS: Both flexion and extension can decompress canal and foramina, depending on the choice for the location of the center of rotation. If lordotic posture is preferred clinically, then the optimal choice may be extension around the center of rotation located at the tip of the spinous process of the burst vertebra.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To present the technique and early results of percutaneous stabilization of U-shaped sacral fractures with attention to neurologic recovery and maintenance of fracture reduction of the sacrum. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SETTING: Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: During a thirty-eight-month period, 442 patients with pelvic ring disruptions were treated at a Level I trauma center. Thirteen (2.9 percent) of these patients had displaced U-shaped sacral fractures treated with percutaneous stabilization. INTERVENTION: Fracture stabilization was accomplished using fluoroscopically guided iliosacral screws inserted percutaneously with the patient positioned supine. Neurodiagnostic monitoring was not used during screw insertions. This technique was limited to patients with sacral kyphotic deformities, which allowed in situ fixation. Sacral neurologic decompression was not performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fracture healing and the stability of fixation were assessed on inlet and outlet radiographs and a lateral sacral view. Detailed neurologic examinations were performed at injury and at follow-up. RESULTS: The sacral fractures were classified based on plain pelvic radiographs and computed tomography scans and included one Type 1, eight Type 2, and four Type 3 fracture patterns. Twenty-five fully threaded cancellous 7.0-millimeter cannulated screws were used. Eleven patients had bilateral screw fixations; one patient had unilateral double screw fixation; and one patient had unilateral single screw fixation. Operative time for screw insertion averaged forty-eight minutes, with 2.1 minutes of fluoroscopy per screw. Accurate screw insertions without neuroforaminal or sacral spinal canal violations were confirmed in all patients with postoperative pelvic plain radiographs and computed tomography scans. A paradoxical inlet view of the upper sacral segments on the injury anteroposterior pelvis was seen in twelve of thirteen patients (92.3 percent), and the diagnosis was confirmed with the lateral sacral view in all thirteen (100 percent) patients. Preoperatively, sacral kyphosis averaged 29 degrees, whereas postoperative sacral kyphosis averaged 28 degrees. Screw disengagement occurred without a change in position of the sacral fracture in the only patient treated with a single unilateral screw. All fractures healed clinically and radiographically. Of the nine patients with preoperative neurologic abnormalities, two (22 percent) patients had residual neurologic deficits. Both patients had associated multiple level lumbar burst fractures, which required decompression and instrumented stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: These sacral fractures are rare and occur after significant spinal axial loading. A paradoxic inlet view of the upper sacrum on the anteroposterior plain pelvic radiograph heralds the diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis is avoided by a high clinical suspicion, early lateral sacral radiographs, and pelvic computed tomography scans. Surgical stabilization may assist in early mobilization of the patient from recumbency and prevents progressive deformity with associated nerve root injury. Percutaneous fixation diminishes potential blood loss and operative times, yet still allows subsequent sacral decompression of the local neural elements using open techniques when necessary. Early percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation is effective treatment for these injuries.},

abstract = {Lesions of the intervertebral disc accompanying vertebral fractures are the subject of controversy and discussion regarding the extent and manner of surgical intervention. The question of when to perform disc resection and intervertebral fusion, in particular, has not been answered satisfactorily. In order to evaluate short- and medium-term lesions of the discoligamentous complex associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures, magnetic resonance images made after stabilisation and again after implant removal were compared. Between 1997 and 1998, 20 patients who had suffered thoracolumbar burst fractures (AO classification A3 and B1 [26]) underwent posterior reduction and stabilisation using a Universal Spine System (USS, Synthes, Switzerland) titanium internal fixator. The implant was removed after an average of 10 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed 1 week after both operations, allowing the changes in a total of 40 intervertebral discs adjacent to the fractured vertebral body to be investigated. The analysis was based on signal intensity of the intervertebral disc in T2-weighted scans and on morphological criteria. A total of 81{\%} of the discs with initially normal T2-weighted signal showed the same signal after implant removal; 5 discs with initially increased signal intensity in T2-weighted scans normalised, 5 showed a decrease in intensity and 3 suffered a partial loss of signal. Among the 9 discs with initially decreased T2-weighted signal, only one had normalised by the time the implant was removed. A total of 86{\%} of the 14 morphologically intact discs retained their structural integrity. Of the 25 discs with minor defects, only one could be considered as intact after implant removal, 15 remained the same and 9 deteriorated in structure. No disruption of the fibrous ring or of the posterior longitudinal ligament was observed, nor was there any prolapse of intervertebral discs. When the intervertebral disk is intact and has normal morphology and a normal T2-weighted MRI signal, resection or fusion of the fracture adjacent discs appears unjustified. In our opinion, the results do not support the possibility of predicting degradation in those discs that showed an altered T2-weighted signal after the first operation.},

abstract = {Burst fractures are less common in children than in adults because of the greater mobility and elasticity of the pediatric spine. Because of these spine characteristics, these fractures may behave differently in childhood than in adulthood. To try to address these differences, we reviewed our experience with 11 children (5 boys, 6 girls) treated for burst fractures. Average age at time of injury was 14.4 years. Follow-up averaged 9 years. All fractures were categorized using the Denis classification system for burst fractures. Three children had associated spinal cord injury. Five children were treated with nonoperative bedrest and casting; the other 6 children, who had the most severe burst fractures, were treated with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. Satisfactory functional results were found in 90{\%} of the children at follow-up. Radiological evaluation at initial and follow-up examination showed that children treated operatively improved or maintained their fracture kyphosis (range, 12 degrees - 19 degrees). Anterior vertebral compression improved an average of 15{\%} (range, 24{\%}-39{\%}). In the children treated nonoperatively, kyphosis progressed an average of 9 degrees (range, 15 degrees - 24 degrees), and anterior vertebral compression increased a further 8{\%} (range, 36{\%}-44{\%}). Our results showed that (a) the children who sustained burst fractures tended to develop mild progressive angular deformity at the site of the fracture, (b) operative stabilization prevented further kyphotic deformity as well as decreased the length of hospitalization without contributing to further cord compromise, and (c) nonoperative treatment of burst fracture was a viable option in neurologically intact children, but progressive angular deformity occurred during the first year after the fracture.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, consecutive case series. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relation between spinal canal dimensions and Injury Severity Score and their association with neurologic sequelae after thoracolumbar junction burst fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a relation in the cervical spine between spinal canal dimension and its association with neurologic sequelae after trauma. A similar relation at the thoracolumbar junction has not been conclusively established. METHODS: Forty-three patients with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12-L2),13 with and 30 without neurologic deficit, were included. Computed tomographic scans were used to measure the sagittal and transverse diameters and the surface area of the spinal canal at the level of injury, as well as one level above and one level below the fracture level. Injury severity score was calculated for both groups. Statistical analysis comparing those with a neurologic deficit to those without was performed by Student's t test. RESULTS: The ratio of sagittal-to-transverse diameter at the level of injury was significantly smaller in patients with a neurologic deficit than in those without a neurologic deficit (P {\textless} 0.05). The mean transverse diameter at the level of injury was significantly larger in patients with neurologic deficit than in the neurologically intact patients (P {\textless} 0.05). The surface area of the canal at the level below the injury was significantly larger in the patients with a neurologic deficit than in those without a deficit (P {\textless} 0.05). Patients with a neurologic deficit had a statistically higher Injury Severity Score when admitted than those without a neurologic deficit (P {\textless} 0.0001), although the difference became insignificant after the neurologic component of the scoring system was eliminated. CONCLUSION: There are no anatomic factors at the thoracolumbar junction that predispose to neurologic injury after burst fracture. The shape of the canal after injury, however, as determined by the sagittal-to-transverse diameter ratio, was predictive of neurologic deficit.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients (6 males and 1 female) aged 13 to 18 years were treated in the Department using Rathke-Schlegel's modification of Ravitch operative technique. In 2 patients the corrected deformity status was maintained by 2 Kirschner's pins that were placed substernally and attached bilaterally to the adjacent ribs. In one patient a direct traction through the sternum was applied and in 4 patients the fixation was achieved by fastening the sternum with wire loops to an overlying AO plate. RESULTS: Very good results were achieved in 4 patients (57.14{\%}) and a good outcome was evaluated in 3 patients with 30{\%} recurrence of the deformity. There was no lethal outcome. Three complications were encountered: in one patient hemothorax occurred that was cured by a single punction aspiration, in other patient one of the Kirschner's pins slipped into the thoracic cavity. The pin but did not injure intrathoracic organs and was promptly removed. In the third patient earlier removal of the plate was required because suppuration developed. CONCLUSION: The presented method for correction of chest deformity is successful if the implants are kept in place from 6 to 12 months. This time is sufficient for formation of a solid callus that prevents recurrence of the deformity.},

Majority of them were young and in a productive age group (mean age were 30 year-old). The mean duration of follow-up was 24.4 months. The injuries were caused by fall from height (69{\%}) and motor vehicle accident (31{\%}). Most of the fracture occurred at 1st and 2nd lumbar vertebrae (24/26). Twelve of the patients did not have neurological deficits. Out of 14 patients with neurological deficits, 64.4{\%} of them showed an improvement of at least one Frankel's grade. There was no defect correlation between canal compromise and neurological deficit. Kyphotic angle improved from 20 degrees to 7 degrees immediately after surgery. In the last follow-up average kyphotic angle was 9 degrees with average lost of 2 degrees. The average length of hospitalization following surgery was 24 days. A posterolateral bony fusion was achieved in all cases at an average of 3 months. Complication included 2 loosening and 3 misplacement of pedicle screw fixation. We concluded that short-segment fixation with posterolateral decompression and fusion is effective in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

Between March 1995 and December 1998 we performed 40 intramedullary nailings using the ACE femoral nail (De Puy). The patients were followed for an average of 27.9 months (range: 6-54 months). The mean age was 33.2 years (range: 17-87 years); the sex distribution was 33 males and 7 females. All fractures were unilateral (right 18, left 22). Most of the fractures were caused by traffic accidents (35), the others originated from sports, work and gunshot (1). Thirty-five fractures were closed and 5 were open: 1 was grade I, 2 were grade II and 2 grade IIIa according to Gustilo's classification. According to the AO classification 18 fractures were type A, 13 type B and 9 type C. The majority of patients had associated injuries: neurotrauma 2, chest trauma 2, and other fractures e.g. of the clavicula, lumbar spine, patella, tibia. Immediate surgery was performed in 34 cases, delayed surgery in 6 cases. All fractures were treated on a fracture table, with closed reduction, reaming of the intramedullary canal, proximal and distal locking and intraoperative control of rotation and length. The mean time to healing was 17.85 weeks (range: 18-50 weeks). The following complications were observed: 3 delayed unions, which united after dynamisation, one malunion, which required corrective osteotomy, and one nonunion, which healed after exchange nailing. We encountered no rotational deformity and no clinically relevant shortening. Six nails were removed due to irritation by locking screws. These results are comparable with those of larger series in the literature with other types of interlocking nails. The union rate in this series was 97.5{\%}.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vasoprotective function of endothelial cells is associated, among others, with biosynthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), carbon monoxide (CO) and plasminogen activator (t-PA). These endothelial mediators calm down activated platelets and leukocytes, prevent the occurrence of parietal thrombotic events, promote thrombolysis, maintain tissue perfusion and protect vascular wall against acute damage and against chronic remodeling. Endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from atherosclerosis or diabetes type 2 is associated not only with suppression in release of the above mediators but also with deleterious discharge of prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGH2, PGG2), superoxide anion (O2-, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). We looked for mechanisms of protective endothelial function, with a special respect to the differences between peripheral and pulmonary circulation. METHODS: Cultured endothelial cells of bovine aorta (BAEC) were used to study physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of increasing free cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i. A porphyrinic sensor quantified the release of NO from BAEC. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) we looked for induction by bradykinin (Bk) of mRNAs for a number of enzymes. In blood perfused rat lungs we studied protective role of NO against injury inferred by lipopolysaccharide on pulmonary microcirculation that was accomplished by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet activating factor (PAF), cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cyst-LTs) and the complement system. In vivo we analyzed the influence of Bk, perindopril and quinapril ('tissue type' angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-Is) on endothelial function in entire circulation of anaesthetized rats using a thrombolytic bioassay and EIA for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen. RESULTS: In BAEC Bk via kinin B2 receptors raised in a concentration-dependent manner (1 pM-10 nM) free cytoplasmic calcium ions [Ca2+]i, that triggered the release of NO from BAEC. Calcium ionophore (A23187, 1-100 nM) as well as receptor agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 10 nM-1 microM), adrenaline (Adr, 1-10 microM) or acetylcholine (Ach, 10-100 microM) produced a similar rise in endothelial [Ca2+]i as did Bk at a nanomolar concentration. 'Tissue type' ACE-Is, e.g. quinapril or perindopril acted through accumulation of endogenous Bk. However, the potency of ACE-I to change endothelial function is by several orders of magnitude lower than that for exogenous Bk. In vivo the major difference between thrombolytic actions by quinapril or perindopril on one hand, and by exogenous Bk on the other was longevity of thrombolysis by ACE I and a distinct hypotensive action of exogenous Bk. Still, the long-lasting isolated thrombolytic effect of ACE I was mediated entirely by endogenous BK as evidenced by the preventive action of icatibant, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist. Moreover, in vivo the immediate thrombolysis by ACE-I was mediated by PGI2 rather than by NO or t-PA, as shown by pharmacological analysis, and by direct blood assays of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen. Bradykinin as a mediator of pleiotropic endothelial action of several cardiovascular drugs (e.g. ACE-I) may complete its mission not only through B2 receptor and [Ca2+]i--mediated release of PGI2 or NO. Here, we describe a new route of the Bk action. Bk mediated induction of the [Ca2+]i-independent, so called 'inducible', endothelial isoenzymes required for generation of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. After 4 hours of incubation of HUVEC with Bk (10 nM) it induced mRNAs for haemooxygenase 1 (HO-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E synthase (PGE-S) whereas mRNA for nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was weakly affected. We proved also that unlike in peripheral circulation, in pulmonary circulation only NO but not PGI2 would play a protective role. In the blood-perfused lung, endotoxaemia liberates lipids, such as TXA2, PAF and cyst-LTs. These toxic lipids along with the activated complement mediate pulmonary damage. Pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide is the only local protector against lung injury evoked by the phagocytised bacterial lipopolysaccharide. SUMMARY: Summing up, in peripheral circulation endogenous Bk is the most efficient activator of protective endothelial function. For instance, thrombolytic action of 'tissue type' ACE-I depends on the Bk-released PGI2. Acting as an agonist of endothelial B2 kinin receptors Bk rises [Ca2+]i with a subsequent activation of constitutive COX 1 and NOS-3. This is followed by an immediate release of PGI2 and NO. Moreover, acting as 'microcytokine' Bk induces mRNAs for HO-1, COX-2 and PGE S, the isoenzymes responsible for a delayed endothelial biosynthesis of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

  abstract = {Binding of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to sites of vascular injury is the first step of hemostasis. Collagen types I and III are important binding sites for vWF. We have previously determined the three-dimensional structure of the collagen binding A3 domain of vWF (Huizinga et al., Structure 1997; 5: 1147). We hypothesized that the top face of this domain might be the collagen-binding site. Based on this hypothesis, we made seven vWF mutants (D934A/S936A, V1040A/ V1042A, D1046A, D1066A, D1069A, D1069R, and R1074A). Collagen binding of these mutants was investigated in ELISA and with Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore). In addition, we studied collagen binding of mutants lacking the A2 or D4 domains, which flank the A3 domain. In ELISA, all point mutants and deletion mutants bound to collagen in amounts similar to wild type (WT)-vWF. In the BIAcore we found that WT-vWF has an apparent KD for collagen of 1-7 nM on a subunit base. The apparent kinetic parameters of the point mutants and deletion mutants were not significantly different from WT-vWF, except for DA2-vWF, which had a lower KD. indicating that the A2 domain somehow modulates binding of vWF to collagen type III. Based on our results, we conclude that the amino acid residues mutated by us are not critically involved in the interaction between vWF and collagen type III, which suggests that the collagen binding site is not located on the top face of the A3 domain.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study was performed. OBJECTIVE: To study clinical and radiologic late results after posterior stabilization of thoracolumbar fractures with internal fixator and interbody fusion via transpedicular bone grafting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The posterior approach, using an internal fixator, is a standard procedure for stabilizing the injured thoracolumbar spine. Transpedicular bone grafting was invented by Daniaux in 1986 for achieving an interbody fusion. Pedicle screw fixation with additional transpedicular fusion has remained controversial because of inconsistent reports and a lack of late results. METHODS: Between January 1989 and July 1992, 76 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were operatively treated, and after a mean of more than 3 years, 56 of 62 patients (90{\%}) still alive who had their implants removed were examined. RESULTS: According to the Magerl classification, 33 patients sustained Type A, 13 Type B, and 10 Type C fractures. Three patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal. In one case of complete paraplegia, no change occurred. The mean operative time was 3 hours. In this study, two complications (3.6{\%}) were observed: one iatrogenic vertebral arch fracture without consequences and one deep infection. Compared with the preoperative status, follow-up examinations demonstrated permanent physical and social sequelae: The percentage of individuals able to do physical labor was reduced by half (22 to 11 patients), whereas the share of unemployed or retired patients doubled (4 to 8 patients). At the time of follow-up examination, only 21 of 42 patients continued in sports. The assessment of reported problems and functional outcome with the Hannover spine score reflected a significant difference between the status before injury (96.6/100 points) and at the time of follow-up evaluation (71. 4/100 points) (P {\textless} 0.001).The radiographic assessment in the lateral plane (Cobb technique) demonstrated a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) mean restoration from an initial angle of -15.6 degrees (kyphosis) to +0. 4 degrees (lordosis). Serial postoperative radiographic follow-up assessment showed progressive loss of correction. At follow-up examination, a mean difference from the postoperative angle of 10.1 degrees was found (P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the preoperative deformity, a mean improvement of 6.1 degrees (average, -9.7 degrees ) at follow-up examination was noted. The addition of transpedicular cancellous bone grafting did not decrease the loss of correction. Computed tomography scans after implant removal were performed in nine cases: Only three of nine patients showed evidence of intervertebral fusion. No correlation could be found between the Magerl classification and radiographic outcome. However, the preoperative wedge angle of the vertebral body correlated significantly with the postoperative loss of reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the disappointing results from this study, the authors cannot recommend the additional transpedicular cancellous bone grafting as an interbody fusion technique after posterior stabilization in cases of complete or incomplete burst injury to the vertebral body.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Statistical analysis of various measurement techniques for thoracolumbar burst fracture kyphosis on lateral radiograph. OBJECTIVE: To determine the most reliable measurement technique. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The treatment of thoracic and lumbar burst fractures involves many factors, including the degree of resultant kyphosis. Although various methods have been described, no study has directly compared these methods for reliability and reproducibility. METHODS: Fifty lateral radiographs of thoracic and lumbar burst fractures were randomly selected and measured on two separate occasions by three spine surgeons using five different measurement techniques. Radiograph quality, fracture type, and the center beam location were determined. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance for repeated measures and analysis of variance using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients were most consistent for Method 1 (rho = 0.83-0.94) followed by Method 4 (rho = 0.65-0.89) and Method 5 (rho = 0.73-0. 85). Intraobserver agreement ({\%} of repeated measures within 5 degrees of the original measurement) ranged between 72{\%} and 98{\%} for all techniques for all three observers, with Method 1 showing the best agreement (84{\%}-98{\%}). Paired comparisons between observers varied considerably with interobserver reliability correlation coefficients ranging from 0.52 to 0.93. Method 1 showed the highest interobserver reliability coefficient (0.81, range 0.71-0.93) followed by Method 5 (0.71, range 0.68-0.75). Method 1 also had the highest percentage of agreement within categories (90{\%} within 5 degrees ). CONCLUSIONS: Method 1 (measuring from the superior endplate of the vertebral body one level above the injured vertebral body to the inferior endplate of the vertebral body one level below) showed the best intraobserver and interobserver reliability overall.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanical study was designed to assess relative rigidity provided by anterior, posterior, or combined cervical fixation using cadaveric cervical spine models for flexion-distraction injury and burst fracture. OBJECTIVES: To compare the construct stability provided by anterior plating with locked fixation screws, posterior plating with lateral mass screws, and combined anterior-posterior fixation in clinically simulated 3-column injury or corpectomy models. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior plating with locked fixation screws is the most recent design and is found to provide better stability than the conventional unlocked anterior plating. However, there are few data on the direct comparison of biomechanical stability provided by anterior plating with locked fixation screws versus posterior plating with lateral mass screws. Biomechanical advantages of using combined anterior-posterior fixation compared with that of using either anterior or posterior fixation alone also have not been well investigated yet. METHODS: Biomechanical flexibility tests were performed using cervical spines (C2-T1) obtained from 10 fresh human cadavers. In group I (5 specimens), one-level, 3-column injury was created at C4-C5 by removing the ligamentum flavum and bilateral facet capsules, the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the posterior half of the intervertebral disc. In group II (5 specimens), complete corpectomy of C5 was performed to simulate burst injury. In each specimen, the intact spine underwent flexibility tests, and the following constructs were tested: (1) posterior lateral mass screw fixation (Axis plate) after injury; (2) polymethylmethacrylate anterior fusion block plus posterior fixation; (3) polymethylmethacrylate block plus anterior (Orion plate) and posterior plate fixation; and (4) polymethylmethacrylate block plus anterior fixation. Rotational angles of the C4-C5 (or C4-C6) segment were measured and normalized by the corresponding angles of the intact specimen to study the overall stabilizing effects. RESULTS: Posterior plating with an interbody graft showed effective stabilization of the unstable cervical segments in all loading modes in all cases. There was no significant stability improvement by the use of combined fixation compared with the posterior fixation with interbody grafting, although combined anterior-posterior fixation tended to provide greater stability than both anterior and posterior fixation alone. Anterior fixation alone was found to fail in stabilizing the cervical spine, particularly in the flexion-distraction injury model in which no contribution of posterior ligaments is available. Anterior plating fixation provided much greater fixation in the corpectomy model than in the flexion-distraction injury model. This finding suggests that preservation of the posterior ligaments may be an important factor in anterior plating fixation. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the posterior plating with interbody grafting is biomechanically superior to anterior plating with locked fixation screws for stabilizing the one-level flexion-distraction injury or burst injury. More rigid postoperative external orthoses should be considered if the anterior plating is used alone for the treatment of unstable cervical injuries. It was also found that combined anterior and posterior fixation may not improve the stability significantly as compared with posterior grafting with lateral mass screws and interbody grafting.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro biomechanical study of lumbar spine segments. OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of the stiffness test protocol. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In an in vitro study using a flexibility protocol, forces are applied and motions are measured; no center of rotation needs to be specified. In a study using a stiffness protocol, the forces are measured and the motions are applied. This does require the center of rotation to be specified. Many biomechanical studies of the spine are available, but there is lack of clarity concerning which of these two test protocols is appropriate to achieve a certain study goal. METHODS: Five-vertebrae lumbar spine specimens with burst fractures in the middle vertebrae (L1) were used. Specially designed apparatus applied flexion and extension rotations around five centers of rotations located on anteroposterior line through the middle of L1. Maximum moment of 4 Nm was applied. RESULTS: The authors found load-displacement curves, ranges of motion, and neutral zones obtained at the five centers of rotations to be markedly different. The center of rotation located at the posterior longitudinal ligament produced large range of motion and neutral zones in comparison to the centers of rotation located at the anterior longitudinal ligament and the spinous process tip (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The stiffness protocol requires that a center of rotation be specified. Shown here is the significant variability in the load-displacement curves, depending on the choice of the location of the center of rotation. Certain center of rotation locations may block the natural motions of the spine and may result in tissue damage.},

The goals of the current study were to identify the correlation between the degree of deformity of a fractured vertebra and the encroachment of neural spaces, and to determine how the encroachment and the deformity can be improved by the extension posture simulating the postural reduction. Experimental burst fractures were produced in L1 vertebrae of nine human thoracolumbar spine segments (T11-L3) with neural spaces lined with tiny steel balls. Lateral radiographs were taken in neutral and extended posture before and after the trauma. Anterior vertebral height, posterior vertebral height, vertebral height ratio, vertebral kyphotic angle, posterior vertebral body angle, and the cross diagonal angle were the geometric parameters used to describe the vertebral deformity. The canal diameter and superior and inferior intervertebral foramen areas were defined as the neural spaces. All parameters were measured on the scanned images of radiographs, as seen on the computer screen. Among the vertebral body parameters, the posterior vertebral height, posterior vertebral body angle, and cross diagonal angle showed significantly higher correlations with the canal encroachment. The extended posture did not improve the canal and intervertebral foramen encroachments. The kyphotic deformity (vertebral kyphotic angle and anterior vertebral height) was improved but the deformity of the vertebral posterior wall (posterior vertebral height and posterior vertebral body angle) was not improved because of the extended posture.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To review and analyze  the sexual function of patients who have sustained lumbar fractures with incomplete paraparesis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: As a result of advances in surgical techniques, most patients with lumbar fractures have significant recovery of neurologic status. Because motor functions are important to patients, most of the studies have concentrated their analyses on motor recovery. Many patients who have almost completely recovered motor function, however, may have sexual dysfunction, especially men. METHODS: Forty-three patients with lumbar fractures that resulted in incomplete paraparesis were analyzed. American Spinal Injury Association motor index points were determined for each patient before and after surgery and used for comparison between American Spinal Injury Association motor index and international index of erectile function score. Eleven male patients who reported sexual dysfunction were evaluated by using Rigiscan. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 42 patients showed neurologic recovery. Average improvement of American Spinal Injury Association motor score was 13. 1 and average international index of erectile function score was 45. Average improvement of American Spinal Injury Association motor score for patients who had not reported sexual dysfunction was 12.5, and average international index of erectile function score was 52. For 11 patients in the sexual dysfunction group, preoperative motor score was 28.0, and average improvement of score was 14.9. Nocturnal penile tumescence monitoring results were abnormal in four cases. Averaged international index of erectile function score was 15. There was a statistically significant difference between the sexually healthy and dysfunctional groups in international index of erectile function score (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas no difference was noted in American Spinal Injury Association motor score. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic recovery after lumbar fractures was improved. Regardless of neurologic recovery, most patients reported some disability, usually caused by pain and occasionally sexual dysfunction. Impairment of sexual function was present in four patients (9.3{\%}). Although these patients may preserve psychiatric erection potential, they usually experienced sexual problems.},

abstract = {There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years. Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis. Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated. Out of these 39 (30.9{\%}) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample. Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41{\%}) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59{\%}) patients. The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9{\%}), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6{\%}), nerve injuries (25.6{\%}) and vascular lesions (15.3{\%}). The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4{\%} and severe head injuries (GCS {\textless} 8) in 33.3{\%}. The mean Hannover Polytrauma score was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points. Osteosynthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53{\%}), eight procedures (50{\%}) in type B fractures and 13 (56{\%}) in type C fractures. In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case. In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients. In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars. Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach. All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7-59 months) after the trauma. The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery. 53.4{\%} of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6{\%} a poor outcome. 15.4{\%} with type C fractures presented with a good outcome, 84.6{\%} with a poor outcome. 80{\%} of the type B and 23{\%} of the type C fractures had a good radiological outcome. 20{\%} of type B and 77{\%} of type C injuries had a poor radiological outcome. Five patients (12.8{\%}) sustained persistent urological symptoms. Three of these had urinary dysfunction, two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurological deficit after a head injury. Ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus. The mortality rate was 28{\%}. Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure. The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury. Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present. Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously. Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks. We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression. The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating. If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice. Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.},

abstract = {Surgical decompression of the spinal canal is presently accepted worldwide as the method of treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures with neurological deficit in the belief that neurological recovery may be produced or enhanced. Our clinical and laboratory experience, however, indicates that the paralysis occurs at the moment of injury and is not related to the position of the fragments of the fracture on subsequent imaging. Since the preoperative geometry of the fracture may be of no relevance, our hypothesis, backed by more than two decades of operative experience, is that alteration of the canal by 'surgical clearance' does not affect the neurological outcome. We have reviewed the existing world literature in an attempt to find evidence-based justification for the variety of surgical procedures used in the management of these fractures. We retrieved 275 publications on the management of burst fractures of which 60 met minimal inclusion criteria and were analysed more closely. Only three papers were prospective studies; the remainder were retrospective descriptive analyses. None of the 60 articles included control groups. The design of nine studies was sufficiently similar to allow pooling of their results, which failed to establish a significant advantage of surgical over non-surgical treatment as regards neurological improvement. Significant complications were reported in 75{\%} of papers, including neurological deterioration. Surgical treatment for burst fracture in the belief that neurological improvement can be achieved is not justified, although surgery may still occasionally be indicated for structural reasons. This information should not be withheld from the patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray tomography in assessing the type of fracture, degree of comminution and amount of articular surface depression in acute tibial condylar fractures and to describe the associated soft tissue injuries diagnosed with MRI. METHOD: 27 patients with acute tibial plateau fractures were investigated using linear X-ray tomography and MRI employing T1-weighted and proton density turbo spin echo, STIR, and T2-weighted gradient echo images. Fractures were classified according to the AO classification system. The degrees of depression and comminution were measured and soft tissue injuries were recorded. RESULTS: Fractures were classified as type B1 in 7, as B2 in 6, and as B3 in 6 cases by MRI. More complex C-type fractures were diagnosed in 8 cases. MR and X-ray grading were consistent with the exception of two B3 fractures, which were graded as B1 by X-ray tomography. X-ray tomography under-estimated the degree of comminution 63{\%} of the patients had either meniscal tears or complete ruptures of their cruciate or collateral ligaments. Ten meniscal tears were diagnosed in 9 of 27 patients. Complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament were seen in 4, and avulsions of the posterior cruciate ligament in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: MRI allows a detailed assessment of acute tibial plateau fractures and can replace conventional X-ray tomography. The high rate of fracture-associated soft tissue lesions makes MRI an especially valuable tool.},

abstract = {In a clinical and axiographic study the outcome of patients with severely displaced fractures and fracture dislocations of the mandibular condyle was evaluated. Two operation methods were compared one via an intraoral approach without joint revision and another via a preauricular approach with open reduction of the joint. In the group with joint revision, resorbable material was used for osteosynthesis. Twenty-eight patients (32 joints) treated without revision of the joint and 26 patients (29 joints) with open reduction of the joint were evaluated. The mean observation time following surgery was 3 years and 10 months (range 1-7.5 years). Clinical examination utilized the Helkimo-index, while the electronic axiographical results were evaluated by using a five point scheme of joint-mobility. Concerning clinical evaluation, 20 out of 28 patients (71{\%}) without joint revision and 23 out of 26 (89{\%}) patients with joint revision had none or only slight dysfunction of the stomatognathic system. When focusing on arthralgia and pain in motion (part D and E of Helkimo's-index) significantly better results were achieved by open joint revision (Helkimo D: p{\textless} or =0.007; Helkimo E: p = 0.0029). No patient exhibited severe dysfunction (group D3). In axiographic evaluation optimal results (group A1) were achieved in seven joints (24{\%}) with revision and four joints (12{\%}) without revision. Twelve out of 29 joints with revision (41{\%}) and six out of 32 joints without revision (19{\%}) were classified as group A2 with a slightly shortened condylar excursion. Revision of joints with disc reduction and reconstruction of ligaments in cases of severely displaced or dislocated fractures resulted in better mobility and less pain. This was seen clinically and in the axiographic results. Looking at the long-term outcome of patients better mobility of the joint without internal derangement due to surgical repair also protects the contralateral (nonoperated) joint. When managing severe TMJ-trauma we suggest that both, bony and soft tissue structures should be reconstructed if there are any signs of internal derangement. However, the limits between bony reconstruction with or without joint revision are still not defined. Our results appear to be promising concerning mobility and absence of pain of the joints after open reduction. Further research comparing the two operative treatment regimes in a randomized controlled clinical trial will be necessary.},

However, most reports have focused primarily on lap seat belts and resultant flexion-distraction injuries. This retrospective chart review studies the relation between the specific type of restraint or air bag and the resultant thoracolumbar spinal injury subtype and associated bodily injuries. The charts of 221 patients who had sustained thoracolumbar fractures in motor vehicle accidents during a 10-year period were reviewed, and 37 patients were identified whose accidents were clearly described as a frontal collision and whose specific form of restraint was recorded. Among the 15 patients who used a shoulder strap and lap belt device (three-point restraint), 12 patients sustained burst fractures (80{\%}) compared with 4 of the 14 patients (28.6{\%}) restrained with lap seat belts alone. Life-threatening intraabdominal injuries occurred in 57.1{\%} of lap-belted victims and in 26.7{\%} of patients who used three-point restraints, and the character of these injuries also differed. No patients in an automobile in which an air bag deployed sustained major associated bodily injuries. Among restrained occupants of head-on motor vehicle accidents who have sustained a thoracolumbar fracture, patients using lap belts are more likely to sustain the classic flexion-distraction injury patterns, whereas patients using three-point restraints may sustain a higher incidence of burst fractures. In addition, three-point restraints are associated with a decreased risk of intraabdominal injury compared with lap seat belts.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro biomechanical study of experimental burst fractures and a pedicle screw device. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects that adjustments of a pedicle screw device have on the neural spaces of the burst fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Decompression of the neural spaces is important for the recovery of neural function after a burst fracture. No studies, experimental or clinical, are available that have attempted to relate the pedicle screw device adjustments to the decompression of the neural spaces. METHODS: Burst fractures were produced at L1 vertebra in nine human lumbar spine specimens. Pedicle screw devices were attached to T12 and L2. Eight device adjustments, consisting of pure translations (distraction or compression), pure extension, and combinations of translation and extension were applied. The dimensional changes in the canal and the superior and inferior intervertebral foramens were measured. Functions of restoration and improvement were determined for the adjustments to evaluate the effects of each adjustment and to determine the optimal adjustment. Analysis of variance was used to find statistically significant differences, with significance set at P values less than 0.05. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the results of the eight adjustments. The most effective adjustments were the combination of 5-mm distraction with 6 degrees extension or 10-mm distraction alone. The worst adjustment was 5 mm of compression. CONCLUSIONS: Restoring compromised neural spaces in a patient with burst fracture is necessary. The choice of a device adjustment was found to be an important factor in the decompression of the neural spaces after the burst fracture. Combined distraction with extension and distraction alone were found to decompress the canal andintervertebral foramens maximally in a burst fracture.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effects of lifting an unexpectedly heavy object on low-back loading and loss of balance. BACKGROUND: It is often suggested that lifting an unexpectedly heavy object may be a major risk factor for low-back pain. This may lead to an increase in muscle activation, stretch of ligaments and posterior disc, and loss of balance.METHODS. Nine healthy male subjects were asked to pick up and lift a box as quickly as possible. The weight of the box was unexpectedly increased by 5 or 10 kg. Kinematics and force data were recorded throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Lifting of an unexpectedly heavy box led to a decrease in maximum torque of the low back compared to lifting the same box mass with correct expectation. The maximum lumbar angle did not increase compared to the light box condition. Only the threat to balance appeared to be somewhat increased.CONCLUSIONS. The lifting of an unexpectedly heavier box appeared not to lead to an increased balance loss or a clearly increased stress of the structures of the low back, although a burst of abdominal muscle activity was found in one condition. These results do not fully clarify the assumed relation between lifting unexpectedly heavy objects and low-back injury. RelevanceA commonly cited cause of low-back pain is the lifting of an unexpectedly heavy object. A study of the responses to such perturbation is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low-back injury.},

This study of 10 consecutive cases admitted to the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre Acute Spinal Cord Injury Unit, over the 1997 to 1998 winter season, analyzes the epidemiology of snowboarding spinal injury. Information was collected retrospectively on the mechanism, location, and pattern of injury, and personal details of the individuals who suffered the injuries. The average age at time of injury was 22.4 years, with a range of 16 to 29. All but 1 of the cases were self-acknowledged expert-level snowboarders, with an average of 6.25 years experience. Nine of the injured were male. There was only 1 cervical injury, with the majority being low thoracolumbar, and 4 incidences of L-1 fracture. Compression and burst fracture were the predominant vertebral fracture patterns and there was a 50{\%} incidence of significant neurologic injury and deficit. The most common mechanism of injury was axial loading following a failed jump or fall from a height, varying from 2 to 25 feet. The lack of associated injuries in 9 of the cases suggests a limited ability of the extremities to offset such falls. Contributing factors included the inherent riskiness of the sport, participant characteristics, lack of formal instruction, and self-constructed jumps. Poor weather conditions, unfamiliarity with a run, collisions, and consumption of alcohol also played lesser roles. The frequent association between spinal fracture and significant neurologic deficit in this group has not previously been reported in other studies.},

abstract = {Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a potent stimulator of bone resorption, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of high bone turnover and osteoporosis. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a competitive inhibitor of IL-1beta effects and the biological effects of IL-1beta are therefore proportional to the ratio IL-1beta/IL-1ra. The coding regions of IL-1beta were examined for sequence variations by SSCP and sequencing after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA. Three previously described polymorphisms (C(-511)-T, G(3877)-A and C(3954)-T) in the IL-1beta gene were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using Ava I, Aci I, and Taq I after PCR. The 86-base pair repeat polymorphism in IL-1ra was examined by PCR and electrophoresis and the T11100-C polymorphism in the IL-1ra gene was examined by RFLP using MspA1I after PCR. All polymorphisms were related to bone mass, biochemical markers of bone turnover, and presence of fracture in a study including 389 osteoporotic patients with vertebral fractures and normal controls. Two normal women were heterozygous for a shift from cytosine to thymine (C3263-T) in exon 4 of the IL-1beta gene. This substitution did not affect the amino acid sequence. We did not find other sequence variations in the IL-1beta gene apart from the already known polymorphisms. The distribution of C(-511)-T, G(3877)-A, and C(3954)-T genotypes was similar in the osteoporotic and the normal controls. No significant differences could be shown in bone mass or bone turnover. In the IL-1ra gene almost complete linkage was confirmed between the already known polymorphisms: G(1731)-A, G(1821)-A, A(1868)-G, G(1887)-C, T(8006)-C, C(8061)-T, 86 base pair variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), A(9589)-T, and a new polymorphism: T(1934)-C. The A1A1/A3 genotypes of the IL-1ra VNTR polymorphism were significantly more frequent in osteoporotic patients (56.2{\%}) compared with age-matched normal controls (43.3{\%}) (chi2 = 4.09; p = 0.043). The relative risk of osteoporotic fractures was increased to 1.68 (95{\%} CI, 1.01-2.77) in individuals with A1A1/A3 genotypes. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was reduced in individuals with A1A1/A3 genotypes (p = 0.014, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The difference in bone mass between A1A1/A3 and A2A1/A2 tended to increase with increasing age. T1100-C genotypes were distributed similarly in osteoporotic patients and normal controls and the polymorphism was without effect on bone mass and biochemical markers of bone turnover. In conclusion, an 86-base pair repeat polymorphism in the IL-lra gene is associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other polymorphisms in the IL-1ra and the IL-1beta genes are not associated with osteoporotic fractures or alterations in bone mass or bone turnover.},

The clinical findings are often difficult to detect, especially in the presence of other (extremity) fractures, head injuries or in patients on respiratory support. The findings of chest radiographs and plain spinal films are described in a series of 23 patients with an upper thoracic spinal fracture. Radiographs were retrospectively reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon and a skeletal radiologist. Fractures were classified according to Magerl and type A1 and A2 compression fractures were excluded. The neurological outcome was assessed using the Frankel scale.Initially, the fracture was missed in 5 patients (22{\%}), mainly due to concomitant life-threatening injuries. Fractures consisted of type A, B and C in one, 10 and 12 patients, respectively. The main findings were: loss of vertical height of vertebra with or without malalignment (21), widened paraspinal line (21), widened mediastinum (4) and no gross abnormalities (2). Neurological lesions were Frankel A, B, C and E in respectively 14, 1, 1 and 7 patients.Upper thoracic spinal fractures are easily missed in patients with multiple injuries. In patients with neurological symptoms CT and/or MRI is required as soon as the general condition of the patient permits this.},

abstract = {There continues to be controversy surrounding the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Numerous methods of fixation have been described for this injury, but to our knowledge, spinal fusion has always been part of the stabilising procedure, whether this involves an anterior or a posterior approach. Apart from an earlier publication from this centre, there have been no reports on the use of internal fixation without fusion for this type of fracture. The aim of the study was to determine the outcome of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures who were treated with short segment pedicle screw fixation without fusion. This is a retrospective review of 28 consecutive patients who had short segment pedicle screw fixation of thoracolumbar burst fractures without fusion performed between 1990 and 1993. All patients underwent a clinical and radiological assessment by an independent observer. Outcome was measured using the Low Back Outcome Score. The minimum follow-up period was 2 years (mean 3.1 years). Fifty percent of patients achieved an excellent result with the Low Back Outcome Score, while 12{\%} were assessed as good, 20{\%} fair and 16{\%} obtained a poor result. The only significant factor affecting outcome was the influence of a compensation claim (P {\textless} 0.05). The implant failure rate (14{\%} of patients) and the clinical outcome was similar to that from series where fusion had been performed in addition to pedicle screw fixation. The results of this study support the view that posterolateral bone grafting is not necessary when managing patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures by short segment pedicle screw fixation.},

abstract = {The authors report on a prospective multicenter study with regard to the operative treatment of fractures and dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine. 18 traumatologic centers in Germany and Austria, forming the working group "spine" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, are participating in this continuing study. Between September 1994 and December 1996 682 patients (64{\%} male) with an average age of 39 1/2 (7-83) years were entered. The entry criteria included all patients with acute and operatively treated (within 3 weeks after trauma) fractures and dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine (Th 10-L 2). Part 1 of this publication outlines the protocol and epidemiologic data. The incidence of fractures and dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine and associated injuries were recorded according to a standardized protocol, as well as the different operative methods and complications, duration of hospital stay, rehabilitation and incapacity. The analysis of the clinical social and radiological course was a second focus. The most frequent mechanism of injury was a fall (50{\%}) or traffic accident (22{\%}). Most of the fractures occurred at the L 1 level (49{\%}). All injuries were classified according to the ASIF (AO) classification. 65{\%} sustained an A-type fracture (compression fracture). Associated injuries were observed in 35{\%} and 6{\%} were polytraumatized. Extremities and thorax were most frequently affected. Younger age and traffic accidents lead more often to C-type fracture (fracture dislocation) and polytrauma. An increased number of multisegmental or multilevel lesions were observed in polytraumatized patients. There were 16{\%} with incomplete paraplegia (Frankel/ASIA B-D) and 5{\%} with complete paraplegia (Frankel/ASIA A). The rate of patients with initial neurologic deficits significantly increased with the severity of spinal injury according to the Magerl classification. Until discharge a neurologic improvement (at least 1 Frankel/ASIA grade) was observed in 32{\%} of the partially paralyzed (Frankel/ASIA B-D) and in 12{\%} of the patients with complete paraplegia (Frankel/ASIA A). A neurologic deterioration occurred in 3 patients (0.4{\%}). As a base for further follow-up and late results the individual starting point was determined by collecting relevant data of the patients' history: 277 (40.6{\%}) patients suffered from simultaneous diseases, one half was spine related. At the time of injury 559 (82.0{\%}) patients were employed; 429 (62.9{\%}) doing manual work. 369 (54.1{\%}) patients stated sportive activities before the injury and 561 (82.3{\%}) designated their "back function" as normal. For the time before injury the patients scored an average of 93.4 points in the Hannover Spine Score (0-100 points concerning complaints and function of the back/spine).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the incremental and single trauma approaches in experimental spinal trauma production. DESIGN: An in vitro study to produce experimental burst fractures in human spine specimens. BACKGROUND: Experimental burst fractures have been produced by researchers for various purposes using two approaches: single and incremental traumas. Both the experimental trauma approaches use drop weight technique. There have been no studies to compare these two markedly different methods. Showing clear advantages of one approach over the other may significantly affect the design of future experimental trauma studies, not only of the spine. METHODS: Using human spine specimens and drop weight technique, burst fractures of varying degrees of severity (defined by canal encroachment) were produced. Impact energies needed for the initial burst fracture and for the progression of the injury, i.e. increased canal encroachment, were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS: Poor correlation was found between the impact energy and the canal encroachment of the initial burst fracture (R(2)=0.27). A much higher correlation was found when the initial burst fracture points (energy-encroachment) were initialized to zero values and only the progression of the injury was studied (R(2)=0.84, p{\textless}0.001). The two regressions represent respectively single and incremental approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Incremental trauma approach was found to be superior to the single trauma approach, in producing a burst fracture with the desired canal encroachment in the human spine specimens, in spite of their inherent variability in size and strength of human vertebrae. RELEVANCE: The design of experimental traumas studies will benefit from the results of the present comparative evaluation of single and incremental trauma approaches. The quality of the experiment may be significantly improved.},

abstract = {Adenosine (ADO) exerts potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. In this paper we address the possibility that these effects are partly mediated by inhibition of the secretion of IL-12, a proinflammatory cytokine and a major inducer of Th1 responses. We demonstrate that 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), a nonspecific ADO analogue, and 2-p-(2-carbonyl-ethyl)phenylethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenos ine (CGS-21680), a specific A2a receptor agonist, dose-dependently inhibited, in whole blood ex vivo and monocyte cultures, the production of human IL-12 induced by LPS and Stapholococcus aureus Cowan strain 1. However, the A1 receptor agonist 2-Chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine and the A3 receptor agonists N6-Benzyl-NECA and 1-deoxy-1-[6-[[(3-iodophenyl)methyl]amino]-9H-purin-9-yl]-N-methyl-be ta-d -ribofuranuronamide expressed only weak inhibitory effects. On the other hand, NECA and CGS-21680 dose-dependently potentiated the production of IL-10. The differential effect of these drugs on monocyte IL-12 and IL-10 production implies that these effects are mediated by A2a receptor signaling rather than by intracellular toxicity of ADO analogue's metabolites. Moreover, CGS-21680 inhibited IL-12 production independently of endogenous IL-10 induction, because anti-IL-10 Abs failed to prevent its effect. The selective A2a antagonist 8-(3-Chlorostyryl) caffeine prevented the inhibitory effect of CGS-21680 on IL-12 production. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 dose-dependently potentiated the inhibitory effect of CGS-21680 and, furthermore, Rp-cAMPS, a protein kinase A inhibitor, reversed the inhibitory effect of CGS-21680, implicating a cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in its action. Thus, ligand activation of A2a receptors simultaneously inhibits IL-12 and stimulates IL-10 production by human monocytes. Through this mechanism, ADO released in excess during inflammatory and ischemic conditions, or tissue injury, may contribute to selective suppression of Th1 responses and cellular immunity.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 42 patients treated at three major medical centers for burst fractures of L3, L4, and L5. This is the largest low lumbar (L3-L5) burst fracture study in the literature to date. The study was designed to assess both radiographic and clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients treated during a 16-year period. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether conservatively treated patients with low lumbar burst fractures had satisfactory outcomes compared with those in a surgically treated cohort of patients. The study included patients with and without neurologic deficits. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures of the low lumbar spine (L3-L5) represent a small percentage of all spine fractures. The iliolumbar ligaments and location below the pelvic brim are two stabilizing factors that are unique to these fractures when compared with burst fractures at the thoracolumbar junction. METHODS: Forty-two (n = 42) patients with low lumbar burst fractures were identified from 1980 through 1996. Medical records, radiographs, and follow-up Dallas Pain Questionnaires were obtained. Loss of anterior vertebral height, kyphotic angulation, and amount of retropulsion were recorded at several phases of treatment. Mean follow-up time was 45.2 months (range, 5-132 months). Twenty patients were treated without surgery (18 were neurologically intact, and 2 had isolated nerve root injury), and 22 underwent surgery (14 had neurologic injury, 8 were intact). RESULTS: No patient showed neurologic deterioration, regardless of treatment. Fracture of the third lumbar segment showed the greatest tendency toward kyphotic collapse and loss of height in the nonoperative group, although this was not reflected in the final functional outcome of both groups. The ability to return to work and achieve a good-to-excellent long-term result was not significantly different among fracture levels or between surgical and nonsurgical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The results of nonoperative treatment of low lumbar burst fractures were comparable with those of operative treatment. The rate of repeat surgery (41{\%}) and absence of a clearly definable long-term functional or radiographic benefit in patients without neurologic compromise may make surgery less appealing.},

abstract = {T(h)1- and T(h)2-related cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10), beta-chemokines (RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta) and their receptor [chemotatic cytokine receptor (CCR) 5], and the cytolytic effector molecule [Fas ligand (FasL)] play an essential role in regulating and co-ordinating acute renal allograft rejection. A chimeric model of acute cellular rejection which involves subcapsular grafting of human renal tissue in the kidneys of immunodeficient rats and subsequent i.p. infusion of allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was used to study cellular infiltration patterns and sequential intragraft gene expression of these key inflammatory mediators. We found that while all molecules are expressed within the human renal implant at specific time points following infusion of allogeneic human PBMC, peak mRNA expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, RANTES and CCR5 is associated with a phase of human mononuclear infiltration and accumulation, prior to graft destruction (induction phase). A short burst of FasL gene expression is found at the end of induction and at the onset of graft deterioration. IL-4 mRNA, which is hardly detectable, and IL-10 mRNA, which appears early and persists throughout follow-up at high levels, both peak after the induction phase with the advent of graft destruction. Furthermore, treatment with CTLA-4-Ig, which hardly affects migration of human effector cells into graft tissue, is associated with a temporary reduction in gene transcript levels for all inflammatory mediators, especially IL-2 and IL-4, reduced apoptosis in the graft and amelioration of tissue injury. Thus, development of acute cellular rejection in our chimeric model involves a co-ordinated pattern of gene expression, in which CTLA-4-Ig promotes its effects by transient inactivation of infiltrating human cells.},

The incorporation and effect on the fusion was analyzed with spiral CT scan after implant removal and the patients were seen for clinical and conventional radiologic examination. We treated 24 type A, 4 type B and 1 type C lesion according to the Magerl classification. 27 patients were stabilized with an internal fixator, 2 with a plate system. The mean operative time totalled 2:50 hours, the intraoperative fluoroscopy time averaged 4:07 minutes and a mean blood loss counted 376 ml. 4 patients out of 6 with an incomplete neurologic lesion (Frankel/ASIA D) improved to Frankel/ASIA grade E. 2 complications were observed: 1 delayed wound healing and 1 venous thrombosis with secondary pulmonary embolism. Compared to the preoperative status our follow-up examinations demonstrated permanent social sequelae: The percentage of individuals able to do physical labor was reduced (15 to 5 patients; p {\textless} 0.01) whereas the share of unemployed or retired patients increased (2 to 12 patients; p {\textless} 0.01). The assessment of complaints and functional outcome with the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" reflected a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.001) between the status before injury (96.6/100 points) and at the time of follow-up (64.4/100 points). The correlation between the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" and the finger-ground-distance was found to be significant (Coefficient Spearman = -0.71; p {\textless} 0.01). The radiographic assessment of the segmental kyphosis (Cobb technique) demonstrated a significant (p {\textless} 0.001) mean restoration from an initial angle of -15.2 degrees (kyphosis) to -3.4 degrees (kyphosis). Serial postoperative radiographic follow-up showed progressive loss of correction; at follow-up examination we found a mean of 7.8 degrees (p {\textless} 0.005). In 16 patients with an additional posterior fusion with autogenous bone grafting an analogous loss of correction was noted. CT scans after implant removal demonstrated an interbody fusion and incorporation of the transpedicular bone graft in 10 (34{\%}) patients. In another 10 (34{\%}) patients the CT scans proved the interbody fusion at the anterior and posterior wall of the vertebral body via direct contact due to collapse of the disc space. In these patients the bone graft was not incorporated and no central interbody fusion could be found. In 9 (31{\%}) patients neither interbody fusion nor incorporation of the transpedicular graft was achieved. A frequent interbody fusion could not be achieved with the technique of transpedicular bone grafting. In case of incomplete or complete thoracolumbar burst fractures the authors recommend a combined operation with restoration of the anterior column with a strut graft or body replacement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction is an unstable spinal  fracture, which is caused by high-energy trauma. There are many methods of treatment, both surgical and nonsurgical, in dealing with spinal burst fractures. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) Fixateur Interne (FI) system was introduced in 1985 for posterior spine surgery with a transpedicular screw system. METHODS: From April, 1989, through December, 1994, we encountered 42 patients with 42 acute burst fractures of the spine; 26 were male and 16 were female, with an average age of 41.2 years. One fracture occurred on T11, seven on T12, 16 on L1, 11 on L2, one on L3, four on L4 and two on L5. According to the Denis classification, there were eight type A, 23 type B, five type C, three type D and three type E fractures. All of these patients received posterior reduction without decompression, posterior short segmental fixation with AO FI instrumentation and posterior fusion. RESULTS: After follow-up for an average of 66.1 months, all fractures were found to have united with residual back pain in only six patients; five patients, including one with nonunion, had back pain without the necessity of medication, and the other one had occasional back pain that was well controlled by medication. The immediate postoperative Cobb's angle improved by an average of 14.2 degrees, and there was an average loss of 3.3 degrees at final follow-up. All patients were neurologically intact at final follow-up except two patients, who were Frankel D. Seven patients had complications during follow-up; one experienced nonunion; four experienced screw breakage, one had screw pullout, and the other experienced breakage of the connecting rod. CONCLUSIONS: From our retrospective study, the outcome of burst fracture of the spine treated with AO FI instrumentation system was satisfactory.},

DESIGN: The state of the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior ligamentous complex, cranial and caudal endplates, cranial and caudal discs and the vertebral body were defined using clinical, experimental and radiological data. The state of these structures was reported for each fracture on the MRI examinations and the different MRI features appropriate for different fracture classes were defined. PATIENTS: MRI examinations of 70 patients with 100 fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were used for this study. RESULTS: Wide variations were seen in the state of the structures studied. We could not find a definite pattern to relate these findings with the AO classification scheme. CONCLUSIONS: MR findings should be integrated into future classification schemes of thoracolumbar spine fractures. This would enable specific data about the structures involved in the stability of the spine to be acquired. Prospective studies using the criteria developed in this study may help resolve some of the controversies concerning the diagnosis and prognosis of these injuries as well as the development of new classification systems.},

All patients were treated by indirect reduction, bisegmental posterior transpedicular instrumentation and monosegmental fusion. Clinical and radiological outcome was analyzed after an average follow-up of 6.4 years. Re-kyphosis of the entire segment including the cephaled disc was significant with loss of the entire postoperative correction over time. This did not influence the generally benign clinical outcome. Compared to its normal height the fused cephalad disc was reduced by 70{\%} and the temporarily spanned caudal disc by 40{\%}. Motion at the temporarily spanned segment could be detected in 11 patients at follow-up, with no relation to the clinical result. Posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures can initially reduce the segmental kyphosis completely. The loss of correction within the fractured vertebral body is small. However, disc space collapse leads to eventual complete loss of segmental reduction. Therefore, posterolateral fusion alone does not prevent disc space collapse. Nevertheless, clinical long-term results are favorable. However, if disc space collapse has to prevented, an interbody disc clearance and fusion is recommended.},

The mean interobserver agreement for all fourteen cases was found to be 67 {\%} (41-91 {\%}),when only the three main types (A, B, C) were used. The corresponding kappa value of the interobserver reliability showed a coefficient of 0,33 (range, 0,30 to 0,35). The reliability decreased by increasing the categories. For some injuries the interobserver reliability was found to be over 90 {\%} and also for the recommended therapeutic procedure there was an acceptable agreement. But the decision between an posterior approach alone or an additionally anterior procedure seems to be the most important question in treatment of spinal injuries at that time.},

abstract = {This article presents a novel photochemically driven surgical tissue adhesive technology using photoreactive gelatins and a water-soluble difunctional macromer (poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate: PEGDA).The gelatins were partially derivatized with photoreactive groups, such as ultraviolet light (UV)-reactive benzophenone and visible light-reactive xanthene dye (e.g., fluorescein sodium salt, eosin Y, and rose bengal). A series of the prepared photocurable tissue adhesive glues, consisting of the photoreactive gelatin, PEGDA, and a saline solution with or without ascorbic acid as a reducing agent, were viscous solutions under warming, and their effectiveness was evaluated as hemostasis- and anastomosis-aid in cardiovascular surgery. Regardless of the type of photoreactive groups, the irradiation of the photocurable tissue adhesive glues by UV or visible light within 1 min produced water-swollen gels, which had a high adhesive strength to wet collagen film. These were due to the synergistic action of photoreactive group-initiated photo-cross-linking and photograft polymerization. An increase in the irradiation time resulted in increased gel yield and reduced water swellability. A decrease in the molecular weight of PEGDA and an increase in concentration of both gelatin and PEGDA resulted in reduced water swellability and increased tensile and burst strengths of the resultant gels. In rats whose livers were injured with a trephine in laparotomy, the bleeding spots were coated with the photocurable adhesive glue and irradiated through an optical fiber. The coated solution was immediately converted to a swollen gel. The gel was tightly adhered to the liver tissue presumably by interpenetration, and concomitantly hemostasis was completed. The anastomosis treatment with the photocurable glue in the canine abdominal or thoracic aortas incised with a knife resulted in little bleeding under pulsatile flow after declamping. Histological examination showed that the glues photocured on rat liver surfaces were gradually degraded with time in vivo with infiltration of inflammatory cells and connective tissues without necrotic sign in surrounding tissue. In addition, in the laparoscopic surgery, percutaneous delivery of the glue and its in situ photogelation on rat liver surfaces were demonstrated using a specially designed fiberscope. These results indicate that the photocurable glues developed here may serve as a biodegradable tissue adhesive glue usable in cardiovascular surgery and endoscopic surgery.},

In this retrospective review of 60 patients in whom ALIF was performed at their institutions between 1996 and 1998, the authors detail the associated complications and their correlation with perioperative factors. The causes, strategies for their avoidance, and the clinical course of these complications are also discussed. METHODS: The study group was composed of 31 men and 29 women whose mean age was 42 years (range 29-71 years). The preoperative diagnosis was discogenic back pain in 33 patients (55{\%}); failed back syndrome in 11 (18.3{\%}); pseudarthrosis in five (8.3{\%}); postlaminectomy syndrome in four (6.6{\%}); spondylolisthesis in three (5{\%}); burst fracture in two (3.3{\%}); and malignancy in two (3.3{\%}). A retroperitoneal approach to the spine was used in 57 of the 60 patients. One interspace was exposed in 28 patients (46.6{\%}), two in 28 (46.6{\%}), and three in four (6.6{\%}). Discectomy and interbody fusion in which the authors placed titanium cages or bone dowels was performed in 56 patients and corpectomy with instrumentation in four. Seven (11.6{\%}) of 60 patients had undergone previous abdominal surgery and 29 (48.3{\%}) had undergone previous spinal surgery. The follow-up period averaged 12+/-4 months (mean+/-standard deviation). Twenty-four general surgery-related complications occurred in 23 patients (38.3{\%}), including sympathetic dysfunction in six; vascular injury in four; somatic neural injury in three; sexual dysfunction in three; prolonged ileus in three; wound incompetence in two; and deep venous thrombosis, acute pancreatitis, and bowel injury in one patient each. There were no deaths. The incidence of complications was not associated with underlying diagnosis (p{\textgreater}0.1), age (p{\textgreater}0.5), previous abdominal or spinal surgery (p{\textgreater}0.1), or the number of levels exposed (p{\textgreater}0.1). CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a detailed analysis of the general surgery-related complications following ALIF. Although many of these complications have been recognized in the literature, the significance of sympathetic dysfunction appears to have been underestimated. The high incidence of complications in this series likely reflects the strict criteria. Many of these complications were minor and resolved over time without long-term sequelae.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors retrospectively reviewed 121 patients with traumatic cervical spine injuries to determine the risk of neurological deterioration following early closed reduction. METHODS: After excluding minor fractures and injuries without subluxation, the medical records and imaging studies (computerized tomography and magnetic resonance [MR] images) of 82 patients with bilateral and unilateral locked facet dislocations, burst fractures, extension injuries, or miscellaneous cervical fractures with subluxation were reviewed. Disc injury was defined on MR imaging as the presence of herniation or disruption: a herniation was described as deforming the thecal sac or nerve roots, and a disruption was defined as a disc with high T2-weighted signal characteristics in a widened disc space. Fifty-eight percent of patients presented with complete or incomplete spinal cord injuries. Thirteen percent of patients presented with a cervical radiculopathy, 22{\%} were intact, and 9{\%} had only transient neurological deficits in the field. Early, rapid closed reduction, using serial plain radiographs or fluoroscopy and Gardner-Wells craniocervical traction, was achieved in 97.6{\%} of patients. In two patients (2.4{\%}) closed reduction failed and they underwent emergency open surgical reduction. The average time to achieve closed reduction was 2.1+/-0.24 hours (standard error of the mean). The incidence of disc herniation and disruption in the 80 patients who underwent postreduction MR imaging was 22{\%} and 24{\%}, respectively. However, the presence of disc herniation or disruption did not affect the degree of neurological recovery, as measured by American Spinal Injury Association motor score and the Frankel scale following early closed reduction. Only one (1.3{\%}) of 80 patients deteriorated, but that occurred more than 6 hours following closed reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Although disc herniation and disruption can occur following all types of traumatic cervical fracture subluxations, the incidence of neurological deterioration following closed reduction in these patients is rare. The authors recommend early closed reduction in patients presenting with significant motor deficits without prior MR imaging.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The surface strain distribution on the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae during axial compressive loading was examined. OBJECTIVES: To examine the general mechanical behavior of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae to evaluate their role in burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures are generally characterized by injury to the middle column and fracturing of the superior endplate. However, results in previous biomechanical investigations have not shown how these fractures are initiated during compression. METHODS: Twenty-one thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (5 T10, 10 L1, and 6 L4) with upper and lower vertebrae were studied. Three-axis rosette strain gauges were cemented to 11 sites on the vertebral surface. An axial compressive load was applied, and the strain was measured in each specimen. The strain recorded by each rosette gauge was converted into a tensile, compressive, and shear component. RESULTS: The highest tensile and compressive strain was recorded at the base of the pedicle. Shear strain in the vertebral body was significantly higher than that in the lamina at all three spinal levels. At L1 and L4, the tensile strain at the superior vertebral rim was higher than that at the inferior rim. CONCLUSIONS: The high tensile and compressive strains found at the base of the pedicle of T10, L1, and L4 indicate that the base of the pedicle is the site of fracture initiation. The higher tensile strain at the superior vertebral rim of L1 and L4 supports the clinical observation of the thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are few publications which relate the injury severity score (ISS) to the thoracolumbar burst fractures. For that reason and for the frequency in which they occur, we have evaluated the severity of the trauma in these patients. METHODS: We have evaluated 190 burst fractures in the spinal cord according to Denis, using the codes of Abbreviated Injury Scales (AIS) for the calculation of the ISS, which uses the three parts of the human body with major severity. These lesions are a squared number and the results are summed up. RESULTS: Among 190 cases evaluated, the median value of the ISS was 13 and the average was 14,4. Males presented a higher ISS than females. The young adult patients presented an average and a median value of the ISS higher than the old patients. The higher the ISS is, the longer the hospitalization period is, except for the patients with the ISS over 35. The fractures in thoracic level show the ISS higher than the rest. The ISS is directly related to surgical treatment and mortality. CONCLUSION: The ISS values which were found show that a less severe trauma can cause a burst thoracic or lumbar spinal cord fracture. The value of the ISS has not shown correlation to the sex and the fracture level, but it is proportional to the hospitalization period, the surgical treatment and the mortality rate. This result shows a value which is inversely proportional to the age of the patients.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study evaluates the biomechanical characteristics of spinal instrumentation constructs in a human unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture model simulated by corpectomy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the biomechanical characteristics of short-segment posterior instrumentation, with and without crosslinks, in a human unstable burst fracture model simulated by corpectomy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures are serious injuries, and their management remains controversial. Some authors advocate the use of short-segment posterior instrumentation for certain burst fractures. Whether crosslinks contribute additional stability has not been determined. METHODS: Six fresh frozen human spines (T10-L2) were potted to isolate the T11-L1 segments, and biomechanically tested in axial rotation, lateral bending, flexion, and extension. A custom spine testing system was used that allows motion with 6 degrees of freedom. After testing was completed on intact specimens, a corpectomy was performed at T12 to simulate an unstable burst fracture with loss of anterior and middle column support. Short-segment transpedicular instrumentation was then performed from T11 to L1. Each specimen was retested with 1, 2, or no crosslinks. Construct stiffness and motion data were analyzed with each intact specimen serving as its own internal control. RESULTS: Torsional stiffness in axial rotation was significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.05) in short-segment fixation constructs with 1 and 2 crosslinks, but none was restored to the preinjury baseline level. Significant reductions in standardized motion were also achieved with 1 and 2 crosslinks compared to no crosslinks (P {\textless} 0.05), but they remained greater than baseline. Crosslinks significantly increased stiffness and decreased motion in lateral bending, beyond the baseline level (P {\textless} 0.05). In flexion, all constructs had significantly decreased stiffness and increased motion compared to the intact specimen (P {\textless} 0.05), with crosslinks providing no additional benefit. Conversely, none of the constructs demonstrated a significant change in extension compared to baseline (P {\textgreater} 0.05). When attempting to load the constructs to failure, screw pullout was seen in all specimens. CONCLUSION: Crosslinks, when added to short-segment posterior fixation, improve stiffness and decrease motion in axial rotation, but do not restore baseline stability in this corpectomy model. Short-segment posterior fixation is also inadequate in restoring stability in flexion with injuries of this severity. Short-segment posterior instrumentation alone can achieve baseline stability in lateral bending, and crosslinks provide even greater stiffness.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the application of a self-designed canal decompressor in the posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with canal encroachment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical treatment is often indicated in the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures accompanied with canal encroachment. Efficient canal decompression would prevent progressive neurologic deterioration and facilitate recovery. Compared with anterior surgical methods, posterior approaches offer rigid fixation without formidable surgical onslaughts. However, the reduction of retropulsed bone fragments via posterior approaches is indirect and thus often inefficient. METHODS: In this study, we designed and applied a canal decompressor in the surgical treatment of 48 cases of thoracolumbar burst fractures using posterior approaches. Canal comprise, Cobb's angles, residual vertebral body height, neurologic outcome, and back pain were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Patients were followed for 18 to 28 months (mean 22.5 + or - 3.5 mo) on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: Operations were performed within relatively short time and without significant blood loss. Radiographs indicated that applying the canal decompressor allowed efficient reduction of canal encroachment from preoperative 53.4{\%} + or - 16.7{\%} to postoperative 12.8 + or - 4.2{\%}. Cobb's angles reduced from preoperative 31.0 + or - 2.5 degree to postoperative 5.1 + or - 0.6 degree. Mean vertebral height was restored to 82.5 + or - 5.7{\%} after operations. Follow-up evaluation within 28 months indicated that neurologic recovery presented in 77.1{\%} of patients, with average improvement of 0.86 Frankel grades. Neurologic deterioration was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the canal decompressor enables efficient and safe reduction of bone fragments retropulsing into the canal in posterior operations. This technique thus provides an alternative method for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

METHODS: Records of 146 men and 44 women aged 13 to 84 (mean, 39) years diagnosed with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were retrospectively reviewed. The laminar fractures and narrowing of the spinal canal were measured using computed tomography. The severity of injury was determined using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the New Injury Severity Score (NISS). The ISS and NISS of patients with and without laminar fractures were compared. The sensitivity and specificity of ISS, NISS, and narrowing of the spinal canal in association with laminar fractures were also compared. RESULTS: 92 (48{\%}) of the patients had laminar fractures. The mean narrowing of the spinal canal was more severe in patients with laminar fractures than those without (47{\%} vs 28{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Patients with laminar fractures had a significantly higher mean ISS (17 vs 12, p{\textless}0.001) and NISS (19 vs 13, p{\textless}0.001). Narrowing of the spinal canal is more sensitive and specific than the ISS and NISS when correlating laminar fractures. CONCLUSION: In patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine, the presence of laminar fractures indicates a more severe injury.},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to assess correlation between the degree of severity of the intervertebral disc injury and the vertebral enoplate injury, evaluated based on MRI, and the resulting final clinical condition and radiological findings. MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY: The authors performed a prospective analysis of patients with thoracolumbar fractures type A1 or A3, without injuries to the nervous system. The study group included 73 subjects (the mean age was 45.52 years), 44 males and 29 females. The type A1 fracture group including 31 patients received conservative treatment and the type A3 fracture group including 42 subjects underwent surgery with posterior transpedicular (TP) fixation. After their injury, the patients were examined using plain x-rays, CT and MRI. At month 18 of their follow up, a control MRI examination was performed to assess spinal kyphotization, the spinal body height decrease and the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The data underwent statistical evaluation. The conservative treatment group showed no statistically significant correlation between the severity of the intervertebral disc and vertebral enoplate trauma and the resulting final clinical outcome or radiological findings, however, the conservative treatment of the type A1 fractures failed in 9.3{\%} of the subjects. This was due to the disc trauma and its consecutive replacement resulted in improvement of the clinical condition. Posterior TP fixation in the type A3 fractures did not prevent statistically significant higher rates of kyphotization and reduced weight- bearing tolerance in patients with more severe disc and vertebral enoplate traumas (grade 3 or 4), compared to patients with less severe traumas (grade 2). CONCLUSION: Posttraumatic assessment of the disc and vertebral enoplate trauma severity using MRI is of significance for predicting the fracture healing prognosis, as well as the final clinical outcome of the procedure.},

abstract = {Corneal injury induces an inflammatory reaction and damages the sensory nerves that exert trophic influences in the corneal epithelium. Alterations in normal healing disrupt the integrity and function of the tissue with undesirable consequences, ranging from dry eye and loss of transparency to ulceration and perforation. Lipids play important roles in this complex process. Whereas lipid mediators such as platelet activating factor (PAF) and cyclooxygenease-2 metabolites contribute to tissue damage and neovascularization, other mediators, such as the lipoxygenase (LOX) derivatives from arachidonic acid, 12- and 15-hydroxy/hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and lipoxin A4, act as second messengers for epidermal growth factor to promote proliferation and repair. Stimulation of the cornea with pigment epithelial derived factor in the presence of docosahexaenoic acid gives rise to the synthesis of neuroprotectin D1, a derivative of LOX activity, and increases regeneration of corneal nerves. More knowledge about the role that lipids play in corneal wound healing can provide insight into the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating corneal injuries. PAF antagonists, lipoxins, and neuroprotectins can be effective therapeutic tools for maintaining the integrity of the cornea.},

METHODS: From September 2007 to December 2008, 11 patients with lumbar burst fracture underwent the removal of the posterior superior corner of the injured vertebral body, the removal of the inferior intervertebral disc adjacent to the injured vertebral body, bone graft fusion, and internal fixation. There were 8 males and 3 females aged 21-48 years old (average 29.4 years old). All the fractures caused by falling from high places. Imaging exams confirmed all the fractures were Denis type B burst fracture. The fracture level was at the L1 in 4 cases, the L2 in 4 cases, the L3 in 2 cases, and the L4 in 1 case. Before operation, the nerve function was graded as grade B in 4 cases, grade C in 3 cases, and grade D in 4 cases according to Frankel scales; the visual analogue scale (VAS) was (7.30 +/- 0.98) points; lateral X-ray films displayed the kyphosis Cobb angel was (24.94 +/- 12.21) degrees; the adjacent superior and inferior intervertebral disc height was (12.78 +/- 1.52) mm and (11.68 +/- 1.04) mm, respectively; CT scan showed the vertebral canal sagittal diameter was (9.56 +/- 2.27) mm; CT three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that the intact part of the injured vertebra was less than 50{\%} vertebra body height and the fracture line crossed the pedicle. The time from injury to operation was 3-11 days (average 4.8 days). The neurological and radiological evaluations were carried out immediately and 3 months after operation, respectively, and compared with the condition before operation. RESULTS: All the patients successfully underwent the surgery. The wound all healed by first intention. All the patients were followed up for 6-18 months (average 14 months). All the patients had a certain degree of nerve function recovery. The Frankel scales in all the patients were increased by 1-2 grade immediately and 3 months after operation. The VAS score was (2.80 +/- 1.49) points immediately after operation and (1.54 +/- 0.48) points 3 months after operation, suggesting there were significant differences among three time points (P {\textless} 0.05). The vertebral canal sagittal diameter was significantly enlarged to (18.98 +/- 4.82) mm immediately after operation and was (19.07 +/- 4.37) mm 3 months after operation. The Cobb angle was (7.78 +/- 4.52) degrees immediately after operation and (8.23 +/- 3.57) degrees 3 months after operation. There were significant differences between before and after operation (P {\textless} 0.05). For the adjacent superior and inferior intervertebral disc height, there was no significant difference when the value immediately or 3 months after operation was compared with that of before operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). X-ray films and CT scan 3 months after operation showed good internal fixation without the occurrence of loosing and displacement. CONCLUSION: For the treatment of lumbar burst fracture, the method of reserving the injured vertebral body and anterior decompression can decompress the vertebral canal and shorten the duration for bony fusion.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the kyphosis angle in thoracic and lumbar burst fractures is often  used to indicate surgical procedures. The kyphosis angle could be measured as vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis according to the method of Cobb. The vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis according to the method of Cobb were measured at 120 lateral X-rays and sagittal computed tomographies of 60 thoracic and 60 lumbar burst fractures by 3 independent observers on 2 separate occasions. Osteoporotic fractures were excluded. The intra- and interobserver reliability of these angles in X-ray and computed tomogram, using the intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) were evaluated. Highest reproducibility showed the segmental kyphosis followed by the vertebral kyphosis. For thoracic fractures segmental kyphosis shows in X-ray "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC 0.826, 0.802) and for lumbar fractures "good" to "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC = 0.790, 0.803). In computed tomography, the segmental kyphosis showed "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC = 0.824, 0.801) for thoracic and "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC = 0.874, 0.835) for the lumbar fractures. Regarding both diagnostic work ups (X-ray and computed tomography), significant differences were evaluated in interobserver reliabilities for vertebral kyphosis measured in lumbar fracture X-rays (p = 0.035) and interobserver reliabilities for local kyphosis, measured in thoracic fracture X-rays (p = 0.010). Regarding both fracture localizations (thoracic and lumbar fractures), significant differences could only be evaluated in interobserver reliabilities for the local kyphosis measured in computed tomographies (p = 0.045) and in intraobserver reliabilities for the vertebral kyphosis measured in X-rays (p = 0.024). "Good" to "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities for vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis in X-ray make these angles to a helpful tool, indicating surgical procedures. For the practical use in lateral X-ray, we emphasize the determination of the segmental kyphosis, because of the highest reproducibility of this angle. "Good" to "excellent" inter- and intraobserver reliabilities for these three angles could also be evaluated in computed tomographies. Therefore, also in computed tomography, the use of these three angles seems to be generally possible. For a direct correlation of the results in lateral X-ray and in computed tomography, further studies should be needed.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Clinical prospective cohort study in academic tertiary setting. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring of the spinal cord in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The majority of clinical studies using intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in spinal trauma focus exclusively on somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP), and there are no specific article on the use of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEP), and stimulated electromyography (SEMG) by direct stimulation of the pedicular screws in thoracolumbar burst type fractures. In addition, controversy regarding the relation between spinal cord decompression and improvement in spinal cord function in such patients remains. METHODS: Eighteen patients with thoracolumbar burst type fractures ({\textless}3 weeks) who underwent indirect posterior spinal cord decompression was carried out from 2002 to 2006. Patients were monitored intraoperatively by SSEP, TcMEP, and SEMG. Findings that suggested worsening of spinal cord function were as follows: reduction in SSEP amplitude greater than 50{\%} or increased latency time of 10{\%}; and increased TcMEP of 100 V. Signs of improvement were 20{\%} increase in SSEP amplitude and 20{\%} decrease in TcMEP stimuli intensity. Four (22{\%}) patients presented neurologic deficit. The mean American Spinal Injury Association (1993) score for motor function was 99+/-29 (range, 90-100). The mean American Spinal Injury Association (1993) score for sensory function was 111+/-32 (range, 107-112). RESULTS: There were no significant changes in the spinal cord function during the surgical procedure, although a decrease in the mean latency could be observed after spinal cord decompression (43.21x40.86; P{\textless}0.01). Two screws triggered SEMG responses and were replaced. All cases were true negatives. CONCLUSION: No significant changes in spinal cord function (to better or worse) were found in the current series after indirect spinal cord decompression through a posterior approach in patients with mild or no neurologic deficits. Further studies with larger series of patients presenting severe neurologic deficits are necessary to better establish these findings.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanical study on 6 fresh frozen human thoracolumbar  spine specimens. OBJECTIVE: Using a novel high viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement and vertebroplasty kit to correct the kyphosis angle of wedge compression fractures (AO/ASIF 1.2). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is typically used to stabilize vertebral compression fractures in situ without correcting kyphosis, with the main target to reduce pain and disability. The vertebroplasty system investigated in this study comprises a high viscosity PMMA cement and uses a hydrostatic pressure hand piece for enhanced cement allocation and flow control. A recent clinical trial demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of cement leakage with this system. METHODS: Six spinal segments (Th11-L1 and Th12-L2) were loaded in a spine tester with pure moments of 7.5 Nm in lateral bending, flexion/extension and axial rotation. The segmental range of motion (ROM) was continuously recorded. The tested states of the specimens were: intact (a), fractured (b), treated with vertebroplasty (c), after loading with 50 to 250 N (d), 50 to 450 N (e) and 50 to 650 N (f) of 1000 cycles each. In each state (a-f), the kyphosis angle was documented fluoroscopically. RESULTS: Kyphosis angle was significantly reduced between intact and fractured states (P{\textless}0.02). Between treated and fractured states, we found highly significant difference (P{\textless}0.001), indicating full correction. During 3000 loading cycles (50-250, 50-450, and 50-650 N), the kyphosis angle remained constant compared to the treated state (P=1.0). We noted a logistic relationship between injected cement volume and extent of kyphosis correction (R=0.89, P{\textless}0.001). In the fractured state, the ROM in flexion/extension increased to 252{\%} of the intact state (P{\textless}0.001). The vertebroplasty treatment decreased ROM to 72{\%} of fractured state in flexion/extension (P{\textless}0.001). Macroscopic inspection of the vertebrae after testing showed an intact interface and tight mechanical interlocking of cement filling and trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: High viscosity vertebroplasty effectively reduced and stabilized thoracolumbar wedge compression fractures and may represent a one-step solution for restoring vertebral body dimensions following thoracolumbar compression fractures, while minimizing the risk of cement leakage and associated complications in vivo.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether zirconia abutments with an internal connection exhibit similar fracture load as zirconia abutments with an external connection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following zirconia abutments were divided into four groups of 20 each: StraumannCARES abutments on Straumann implants (group A), Procera abutments on Branemark implants (group B), Procera abutments on NobelReplace implants (group C), and Zirabut SynOcta prototype abutments on Straumann implants (group D). The abutments were fixed on their respective implants either internally via a secondary abutment (A) or a metallic coupling (C) (two-piece) or directly externally (B) and internally (D) (one-piece). In each group, 10 abutments were left unrestored (A1 to D1). Ten received glass-ceramic crowns (A2 to D2). Static loading was performed according to the ISO norm 14801 until failure. The bending moment was calculated for comparison of the groups and subjected to statistical analysis (Student t test). RESULTS: The mean bending moments of the unrestored abutments were 371.5 +/- 142.3 Ncm (A1), 276.5 +/- 47.6 Ncm (B1), 434.9 +/- 124.8 Ncm (C1), and 182.5 +/- 136.5 Ncm (D1). Two-piece internally connected abutments exhibited higher bending moments than one-piece internally (C1 versus D1 P = .003, A1 versus D1 P = .03) or externally (C1 versus B1 P = .004) connected abutments. The groups with restorations did not show different bending moments than those without restorations. The mean bending moments of the restored abutments were 283.3 +/- 44.8 Ncm (A2), 291.5 +/- 31.7 Ncm (B2), 351.5 +/- 58 Ncm (C2), and 184.3 +/- 77.7 Ncm (D2). Group C2 exhibited the highest bending moment (P {\textless} .05). Internally connected one-piece abutments (D2) were weaker than all other groups (D2 versus A2 P = .002; D2 versus B2 P = .001; D2 versus C2 P = .0003). CONCLUSIONS: The type of connection significantly influenced the strength of zirconia abutments. Superior strength was achieved by means of internal connection via a secondary metallic component.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy regarding the fixation level for the management of unstable thoracolumbar spine fractures exists. Often poor results are reported with short-segment fixation. The present study is undertaken to compare the effect of fixation level and variable duration of postoperative immobilization on the outcome of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by posterior stabilization without bone grafting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, prospective, and consecutive series was conducted at a tertiary level medical center. Thirty-six neurologically intact (Frankel type E) thoracolumbar burst fracture patients admitted at our institute between February 2003 and December 2005 were randomly divided into three groups. Group I (n = 15) and II (n = 11) patients were treated by short-segment fixation, while Group III (n = 10) patients were treated by long-segment fixation. In Group I ambulation was delayed to 10th-14th postoperative day, while group II and III patients were mobilized on third postoperative day. Anterior body height loss (ABHL) percentage and increase in kyphosis as measured by Cobb's angle were calculated preoperatively, postoperatively, and at follow-up. Denis Pain Scale and Work Scales were obtained during follow-up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 13.7 months (range 3-27 months). At the final follow-up the mean ABHL was 4.73{\%} in group I compared with 16.2{\%} in group II and 6.20{\%} in group III. The mean Cobb's angle loss was 1.8 degrees in group I compared with 5.91 degrees in group II and 2.3 degrees in group III. The ABHL difference between groups I and II was significant (P = 0.0002), while between groups I and III was not significant (P = 0.49). CONCLUSION: The short-segment fixation with amenable delayed ambulation is a valid option for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures, as radiological results are comparable to that of long-segment fixation with the advantage of preserving maximum number of motion segments.},

abstract = {Burst fractures of the lumbar spine with instability or severe kyphosis are best  served by surgical treatment. The question as to how these fractures should be approached and stabilized (anteriorly, posteriorly, or combined anteroposteriorly) is controversial. We performed decompression, correction, and interbody fusion using a single posterior approach for Denis type B or C lumbar burst fractures with severe kyphosis. The operative technique is as follows: after partial laminectomy, the bone fragment, which had migrated into the spinal canal, is impacted into the posterior wall of the vertebral body. After curetting the injured disk, bone chips and adapted lamina are inserted into the disk space for anterior support. Five Denis type B or C burst fractures demanding {\textgreater}20 degrees kyphosis correction were treated by this procedure. Mean follow-up was 41 months. We evaluated neurologic assessment and localized kyphotic angle. The neurologic function of all 5 patients improved by at least 1 grade, as measured by the Frankel grading scale. Mean values of localized kyphosis improved from a mean 23.0. before surgery to -3.0 degrees after surgery. At follow-up examination, average regional kyphosis was -2.4 degrees . No implant failure was observed at follow-up. Bony fusion was achieved in all patients. The advantages of this operative procedure are it is safe for the neural structures and complete spinal canal decompression and kyphosis correction are achieved, while providing anterior support and posterior stabilization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Treatment of unstable burst fractures in the dorsolumbar spine still remains controversial. Surgical stabilization has been aimed to prevent long-term back pain and progression of deformity. PURPOSE: This study was aimed to analyze the degree of loss of correction of the angle of kyphosis with pedicle screw instrumentation in place and the components responsible for the recurrence of kyphosis after surgical stabilization of dorsolumbar A3 fractures and to assess the return of functional capacity in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: This study involves 26 patients who had dorsolumbar unstable burst fractures (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen type A3). OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiological assessment at injury, immediate postoperative period, and most recent follow-up along with functional assessment using short form 36 (SF-36) and return to work. METHODS: All the patients had posterior pedicle screw instrumentation without fusion for unstable dorsolumbar burst compression (A3) fractures. The mean follow-up period was 25.5 months. All of them had their fractures stabilized with Universal Spinal System (Synthes, Welwyn Garden City, UK) Fracture System. Serial standing lateral radiographs were taken from the immediate postoperative period to the most recent follow-up. The angle of kyphosis; the heights of the discs above and below the fractured vertebra; and the heights of the vertebral bodies above, at, and below the fractured level were measured. The height at each level was measured in three segments (anterior, middle, and posterior). The values were normalized to avoid discrepancies while comparing radiographs. The difference in the height of each segment measured between the immediate postoperative period and the most recent follow-up was computed. RESULTS: The mean angle of kyphosis was 6.3+/-8.9 in the immediate postoperative period and 15.7+/-6.7 at the most recent follow-up (p{\textless}.001). The mean patient function score from SF-36 was 52.3{\%}, and the mean pain score was 44.9{\%}. There was no relationship to the loss of correction angle of kyphosis to the patient function score (r=0.06, p=.76) and the pain score (r=0.11, p=.58). The correlation between the corresponding difference in the height of each segment and the degree of loss of correction of the angle of kyphosis showed positive correlation to the decrease in the anterior and middle segment heights at the fractured vertebral level. CONCLUSION: There is a progressive loss of correction of the angle of kyphosis after posterior stabilization with instrumentation even without implant removal that mainly corresponds to the decrease in the anterior segment height of the fractured vertebral body.},

In contrast to established methods, CLM does not require the pretreatment of target cells with radioactive or toxic labeling substances. CTLs from healthy HLA-A2 positive donors were stimulated by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with HLA-A2 restricted HCMV-pp65 nonamer peptides. HLA-A2 positive T2 cells or autologous monocytes pulsed with HCMV-pp65 nonamer peptide served as target cells. Lysis was detected only in HCMV-pp65-pulsed target cells incubated with CTLs from seropositive donors stimulated by HCMV-pp65-pulsed DCs. After 3 days, stimulation 38{\%} of T2 cells and 17{\%} of monocytes were lysed at an effector to target ratio of 8:1. In conclusion, CLM represents a highly sensitive, fast, material-saving and non-toxic/non-radioactive method for the measurement of antigen-specific CTL cytotoxic activity.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the types of orthopedic spine fractures sustained by North Atlantic Treaty Organization soldiers when vehicles are attacked by improvised explosive devices (IEDs), with specific focus on the flexion-distraction type thoracolumbar fracture (Chance fracture). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Operation Enduring Freedom is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's effort in Afghanistan. IED attacks on armored vehicles are common and account for high proportion of soldiers' deaths and injuries. METHODS: Retrospective record review was accomplished on soldiers admitted to a military hospital with orthopedic spine fractures after IED attacks on vehicles from January 1, 2008 to May 15, 2008. Thoracolumbar fractures were classified using the McAfee classification system. RESULTS: Twelve male patients with 16 thoracolumbar fractures were identified (3 patients with multiple fractures). The 16 thoracolumbar fractures included 6 flexion-distraction fractures in 5 patients (38{\%}, 6/16: two T12, two L1, one L3, and one L4), 7 compression fractures in 5 patients (44{\%}, 5/16; one T7, one T8, two L1, one L2, one L3, and one L4), and 3 burst fractures (19{\%}, 3/16; two L1 and one L2). CONCLUSION: The incidence of flexion-distraction thoracolumbar (Chance) fractures has been reported to be between 1.0{\%} and 2.5{\%} in most spine fracture series. In this small study, Chance fractures represented 38{\%} of all tho-racolumbar fractures sustained after IED attack on armored vehicles. The blast pattern associated with IED explosion may be responsible for the high rate of these injuries in vehicle occupants.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors compared the outcome of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with and without a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO). METHODS: As of June 2002, all consecutive patients satisfying the following inclusion criteria were considered eligible for this study: 1) the presence of an AO Classification Type A3 burst fractures between T-11 and L-3, 2) skeletal maturity and age {\textless} 60 years, 3) admission within 72 hours of injury, 4) initial kyphotic deformity {\textless} 35 degrees, and 5) no neurological deficit. The study was designed as a multicenter prospective randomized clinical equivalence trial. The primary outcome measure was the score based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire assessed at 3 months postinjury. Secondary outcomes are assessed until 2 years of follow-up have been reached, and these domains included pain, functional outcome and generic health-related quality of life, sagittal alignment, length of hospital stay, and complications. Patients in whom no orthotic was used were encouraged to ambulate immediately following randomization, maintaining "neutral spinal alignment" for 8 weeks. The patients in the TLSO group began being weaned from the brace at 8 weeks over a 2-week period. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were followed to the primary outcome time point, and 47 were followed for up to 1 year. No significant difference was found between treatment groups for any outcome measure at any stage in the follow-up period. There were 4 failures requiring surgical intervention, 3 in the TLSO group and 1 in the non-TLSO group. CONCLUSIONS: This interim analysis found equivalence between treatment with a TLSO and no orthosis for thoracolumbar AO Type A3 burst fractures. The influence of a brace on early pain control and function and on long-term 1- and 2-year outcomes remains to be determined. However, the authors contend that a thoracolumbar burst fracture, in exclusion of an associated posterior ligamentous complex injury, is inherently a very stable injury and may not require a brace.},

abstract = {Under a blast or impact load, rapid movement of the thoracic wall generates stress in lung, a foam-like structure of high compressibility, which is different from general solids. Due to this unique characteristic, it is hypothesized that when lung is subjected to a blast or impact load, there will be an initial low stress progressively developed into a high stress in a short duration in a thin layer of parenchyma at the lung surface. Compared to the incident stress, the actual stress value experienced by lung is amplified, which may cause alveolar-capillary walls to burst, subsequently results in injuries such as edema or hemorrhage. This hypothesis can explain one significant phenomenon observed in animal tests that the gross thoracic compression do not cause major lung injury and there is a close relationship between thoracic wall velocity and the lung injury degree. According to the hypothesis, under a blast or impact load, there should be a significant injury degree discrepancy between a thin layer of parenchyma at the lung surface and the rest of the lung. Serious injuries should be mainly found in this thin layer, which can be employed to test whether this amplified effect exists or not. The hypothesis may shed some light on the mechanism of blast lung injury.},

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with severe polytrama including 15 males and 6 females with an average age of 40-years-old ranging from 20 to 60 years, were treated by immediate fluid resuscitation and emergency simple operation so as to control the bleeding and contamination. According to Frankel grade of spinal nerves function, 3 cases were grade A, 3 were grade B, 9 were grade C, 6 were grade D. Ten cases were performed to open abdominal operation, 6 cases underwent closed negative pressure drainage thorough chest, 2 cases with lung rupture were treated by repairing operation. During operation, 9 cases were treated with by external fixation and 5 cases were skeletal traction or external fixation with plaster support for extremities fractures. After emergency operation, the patients were transported into surgical intensive care unit (SICU), and corrected the hypothermia, acidosis and coagulation. The definitive thoracolumbar operation was performed between 5 to 7 days as soon as the vital signs became stable. RESULTS: Among 21 cases, trauma hemorrhagic shock was corrected rapidly in 18 cases and 3 cases died in 4 to 26 hours. The survival rate was about 85.7{\%} (18/21). Eighteen patients were followed up for 6 to 14 months with an average of 10 months. According to Frankel grading, 3 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 3 cases were grade C, 3 cases were grade D, 7 cases were grade E. CONCLUSION: It may increase the therapy achievement rate excellently and decrease the disabled rate that performing damage control orthopaedics (DCO) timely, relifing the compression on the spinal cord and re-establishing the stability of spinal column as early as possible.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and effect of the technique of reconstructing anterior and middle column by posterior approach in treatment of lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From July 2005 to January 2007, 22 patients of lumbar burst fractures (18 males and 4 females, the age was from 28- to 57-years-old with an average of 42.7 years) were treated as the following surgical procedures: based on the routinal posterior approach, one of the transverse process of the injured vertebral was incised to get access to the lateral side of the injured vertebral body. After cleaning of all the displaced fracture fragments and decompressing the spinal canal, the titanium mesh packed with autografts were implanted from lateral side to reconstruct the anterior and middle column. The above and below adjacent vertebral body were fixed by transpedicular screws. The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, vertebral height, degree of kyphotic deformity and comprised spinal canal were recorded. RESULTS: The average operative time was 3.5 h (2.8-5.8 h) and the average blood loss was 820 ml (650-2100 ml). All the patients were followed up with an average 17.2 months (from 12 to 28 months). The height of the injured vertebral body were restored from (23.70 +/- 9.31){\%} preoperative to (95.77 +/- 1.93 ){\%} postoperative (P{\textless}0.05). The natural spinal curvatures and spinal canal were restored. Three cases were involved in transient iatrogenic nerve root injury. And 1 case was involved in the loosening of the connected rod of the pedicle screw system at 3 months after operation. CONCLUSION: The technique of implanting the titanium mesh by posterior approach was effective and safe enough to reconstruct the anterior and middle column in treating lumbar burst fracture. With this technique, good results could be achieved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare nonoperative treatment methods for traumatic  thoracic and lumbar compression fractures and burst fractures. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial with long-term follow-up. SETTING: Two general hospitals in the Netherlands. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a traumatic thoracic or lumbar spine fracture, without neurologic damage, with less than 50{\%} loss of height of the anterior column and less than 30{\%} reduction of the spinal canal were included. INTERVENTION: Patients in the compression group were randomized to physical therapy and postural instructions, a brace for 6 weeks, or a Plaster of Paris cast for 6 or 12 weeks. Patients in the burst group received a brace or a Plaster of Paris cast, both for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up examinations included radiographs, Visual Analogue Scores for toleration of treatment and persistent pain, and an Oswestry Disability Index at long-term follow-up. RESULTS: There were 133 patients: 108 in the compression group and 25 in the burst group. For compression fractures, physical therapy and brace were considered the most tolerable. Brace therapy scored significantly better on the Visual Analogue Scores for residual pain and on the Oswestry Disability Index. None of the treatments had any significant effect on the residual deformity measurements. For burst fractures, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Brace treatment with supplementary physical therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Furthermore, more than 20{\%} of all patients had moderate or severe back pain at long-term follow-up.},

abstract = {Posterior instrumentation allows good osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar junction fractures. However, in approximately 20{\%} of cases, anterior bone defects may persist, leading to pseudoarthrosis and loss of reduction. Anterior approaches can circumvent this drawback, but they are considered aggressive with a high rate of complications. The advent of the endoscopic mini-invasive techniques has led to a reduction in the number of complications while maintaining the same consolidation rate. Nevertheless, poor restitution of anatomic curves is a reproach for this technique. This prospective study reports clinical and radiological result of 50 patients (19 women and 31 men) operated between April 2000 and March 2006 with a video-assisted anterior approach using an endodistractor for reduction and consequent insertion of the implant. There were A3 (n = 44), A2 (n = 2), A1 (n = 3) and C1 (n = 1) fractures (Magerl classification). The specific system for fracture reduction was used in the last 39 cases of this series. A Pyramesh cage (Medtronic, Memphis, USA) was used in 15 patients, a peek cage (Creaspine, Bordeaux, France) in 30 patients and a tricortical graft in 5 patients. Standard X-rays and CT scan were performed pre-operatively. Kyphosis, and angulations were measured pre-, per- and post-operatively. Mean immediate postoperative gain in localized kyphosis was 12.18 degrees and mean gain at last follow-up was 11.71 degrees. Mean immediate postoperative gain in RA was 13.24 degrees and remained identical at last follow-up. Five patients had a transient pulmonary atelectasia and there was one pulmonary infection. No neurological complication occurred. Fracture reduction is comparable to the best thoracotomy series while limiting approach-related complications.},

abstract = {Motor vehicle collision (MVC) is one of the most common causes of thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) injury. Although it is of no doubt that the use of seatbelt reduces the incidence and severity of MVC-induced TLJ injury, how it is protective for front-seat occupants of an automobile after rollover crashes is unclear. Among 200 consecutive patients with a major TLJ (Th11-L2) injury due to high-energy trauma admitted from 2000 to 2004, 22 patients were identified as front-seat occupants of a four-wheel vehicle when a rollover crash occurred. The 22 patients were divided into two groups: 10 who were belted, and 12 who were unbelted. Patients' demographics including the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS), incidence of neurologic deficit, level of TLJ injury, and type of TLJ injury according to the AO fracture classification were compared between the two groups. Neurologic deficit was present exclusively in the unbelted group, and the difference in the incidence was statistically significant (P = 0.04). Similarly, AO type B/C injury was present exclusively in the unbelted group. The belted group had a significantly lower mean ISS than the unbelted group (P {\textless} 0.01). Comparison between the ejected and non-ejected victims within the unbelted group revealed no statistical difference in the incidence of neurologic deficit or type of injury. It is likely that the high incidence of neurologic deficit in the unbelted group was due to the high incidence of AO type B/C injury. This study indirectly proves the efficacy of seatbelt in reducing the severity of rollover-induced TLJ injury. Because of the limited number of cases, it is uncertain whether ejection from vehicle, which occurs exclusively in the unbelted victims, is a crucial factor in determining the severity or type of injury after rollover crashes.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Controlled in vitro study. OBJECTIVE: To compare two kyphoplasty techniques in cadaveric fractured vertebrae: an experimental vertebral jack tool (VJT) and an inflatable bone tamp (IBT). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A previous biomechanical study showed restored strength and stiffness after height restoration in cadaveric-fractured osteoporotic vertebrae using a new device for reduction of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. METHODS: Anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created in 8 (4 lumbar, 4 thoracic) vertebrae by displacement eccentric external forces. In all vertebrae the amount of height reduction was 35{\%}. After compression, 4 vertebrae were restored in height using the VJT procedure. Four vertebrae were restored in height using the IBT procedure. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. RESULTS.: In the VJT group the post-restoration strength was 81{\%} +/- 13{\%} of the original strength and in the IBT group it was 96{\%} +/- 32{\%}. The post-restoration stiffness in the VJT group was 61{\%} +/- 42{\%} of the original stiffness and in the IBT group 76{\%} +/- 62{\%} of the original stiffness. The vertebrae in the VJT group were restored to 101{\%} +/- 2{\%} of their original height whereas this was 104{\%} +/- 14{\%} in the IBT group. In this study, no cases of cement leakage were found. No cases of damaging of the end plates, new fractures or perforations were seen in both groups. The mean amount of cement inserted for the VJT group was 3.6 +/- 0.9 cm and for the IBT group 5.9 +/- 0.8 cm. CONCLUSION: Both kyphoplasty procedures were able to restore height in this in vitro study, while strength and stiffness were partially restored, with no significant differences. In this study on average significant less cement was used in the VJT procedure. No complications were noted in both groups. This new end plate-to-end plate laminar augmentation technique may be of clinical advantage.},

abstract = {Burst fractures typically occur at T12 or L1 and create a sagittal deformity by a compression mechanism. This posttraumatic kyphosis is evaluated preoperatively by measuring the sagittal index of Farcy. Posterior instrumentation using in situ contouring is based on a bilateral insertion of rods which take the shape of the spine first. The rods are placed in a perpendicular position to monoaxial pedicular screws and then bent in situ, which makes the spine follow the movements of the rods. This principle makes it possible to correct the posttraumatic kyphosis at the level of the fractured vertebra and the overlying disk, which will open progressively using a ligamentotaxis mechanism. An additional anterior approach is indicated if the sagittal correction through the disk represents less than 50{\%} compared to the total correction (in other words, if the correction of the traumatic deformity is obtained more in the disk than in the bone ({\textgreater}50{\%}), an additional anterior approach is performed: more through the disk than the vertebral body ({\textgreater}50{\%})). This reliable technique meets the requirements of sagittal posttraumatic kyphosis correction, and provides a solid construct which avoids bracing.},

METHODS: From February 2001 to May 2006, 8 cases of fourth lumbar burst fractures were treated by anterior decompression, correction, reduction, iliac autograft, Z-plate internal fixation with-iliac fenestration. Of them, there were 7 males and 1 female, aging 24-46 years with an average of 29.3 years, including 3 cases of Denis type A and 5 cases of Denis type B. The decompression, intervertebral height were compared between preoperation and postoperation by CT scanning. According to Frankel assessment for neurological status, 2 cases were at grade C, 5 at grade D and 1 at grade E before operation. Four cases had different degrees of disturbance of sphincter. Time from injury to operation was 8 hours to 11 days. The preoperative height of the anterior border of the L4 vertebral body was (13.8 +/- 2.3) mm, the Cobb angel of fractured vertebral body was (13.2 +/- 2.5) degrees, the vertebral canal sagittal diameter of L4 was (10.6 +/- 3.5) mm. The bone graft volume was (7.5 +/- 1.3) cm3 during operation. RESULTS: Operations were performed successfully. The mean operative time was (142 +/- 25) minutes and the mean amount of blood loss was (436 +/- 39) mL. The incisions obtained healing by first intention after operation. Two cases suffered donor site pain and received no treatment. The follow-up time of 8 cases was from 21 months to 52 months (mean 24.5 months). At one week after operation, the height of the anterior border of the L4 vertebral body was (32.5 +/- 2.6) mm, the Cobb angel of fractured vertebral body was (6.8 +/- 3.7) degrees, and the vertebral canal sagittal diameter of L4 was (19.8 +/- 5.1) mm, showing significant difference when compared with those of preoperation (P {\textless} 0.01). At the final follow-up, the results showed that the pressure was reduced sufficiently, all autograft fused well, the neurological status improved at Frankel grade from C to D in 1 patient, from D to E in 3 patients, but the others had no improvement. In 4 patients who had disturbance of sphincter, 3 restored to normal and 1 was better off. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes of anterior surgery for fourth lumbar burst fractures with iliac fenestration are satisfactory. It can facilitate operation, reduce the pressure sufficiently, maintenance intervertebral height and recover the neurological function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are several surgical techniques currently employed to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures, including anterior fixation, posterior fixation, or combined anterior-posterior fixation. Biomechanical analysis of the various types of surgical techniques is therefore critical to enable selection of the appropriate surgical method for successful spinal fusion. However, the effects of the various spinal fusion techniques on spinal stiffness have not been clearly defined, and the strengths and weaknesses of each fusion technique are still controversial. METHODS: The biomechanical effects of increasing the number of anterior rods and removing the mid-column in anterior fixation, posterior fixation, and combined anterior-posterior fixation on spinal stiffness in thoracolumbar burst fractures was investigated. Finite element analysis was used to investigate the effects of the three fusion methods on spine biomechanics because of its ability to control for variables related to the material and experimental environment. RESULTS: The stiffness of the fused spinal junction highly correlates with the selection of an additional posterior fixation. The mid-column decompression showed a significant change in stiffness, although the effect of decompression was much less than that with the application of posterior fixation and the anterior rod number. In addition, two-rod anterior fixation without additional posterior fixation is able to provide enough spinal stability; and one-rod anterior fixation with posterior fixation yields better results in regard to preventing excessive motion and ensuring spinal stability. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that careful consideration is necessary when choosing the anterior rod number and applying posterior fixation and mid-column decompression during surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of 3 spine surgeons, 3 spine fellows, 3 nonspine  orthopedists, and 12 orthopedic residents classifying 97 thoracolumbar fractures using the Denis, Association for Osteosynthesis (AO), and Thoracolumbar Injury Severity Score (TLISS) systems and reclassifying them 3 months later. OBJECTIVE: To compare the reliability of the Denis, AO, and TLISS classification systems and evaluate the skills necessary for their use. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The Denis and AO systems are the traditional methods of classification of thoracolumbar fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel classification system, the TLISS and compare its reliability among observers as compared with the Denis and AO classifications. METHOD: Ninety-seven sequential fractures from 1 surgeon's practice at a level 1 trauma center were collected. Twenty-one orthopedic physicians from two area level 1 trauma centers then completed the evaluation of the all fractures. Evaluator experience included staff, spine fellows, and residents. The interobserver and intraobserver reliability were determined. RESULT: In the TLISS, subgroups of evaluators, showed variation in reliability as expected with the highest reliability occurring in the senior resident group and attending spine surgeon group. The lowest reliabilities were in the nonspine attending orthopedists and junior residents. In each group, the neurologic status was consistently the category with the highest interobserver and intraobserver reliability. In the Denis and AO classifications, the highest reliabilities were again in the senior residents and spine attendings. The lowest were again in the nonspine attendings and junior residents. CONCLUSIONS: As a management tool, the TLISS seems to be an acceptably reliable system when compared with the Denis and AO systems. There is a base level of knowledge and familiarity necessary for the application of the system at reliable levels.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The majority of osteoporotic, spinal cord compressive, vertebral fractures occurs at the thoracolumbar junction level. When responsible for neurological impairment, these rare lesions require a decompression procedure. We present the results of a new option to treat these lesions: an open balloon kyphoplasty associated with a short-segment posterior internal fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients, aged a mean 72.3 years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented osteoporotic burst fractures located between T11 and L2 associated with neurological impairment. The surgical procedure first consisted of a laminectomy, for decompression, followed by an open balloon kyphoplasty. A short-segment posterior internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local kyphosis was considered severe. A CAT scan study evaluated local vertebral body's height restoration using two pre- and postoperative radiological indices. RESULTS: All of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14 months. Local kyphosis improved a mean 10.8 (p{\textless}0.001). Vertebral body height was also substantially restored, with a mean gain of 26{\%} according to the anterior height/adjacent height ratio and 28{\%} according to the Beck Index (p{\textless}0.001). Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side effect. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10 patients; two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking capacity. DISCUSSION: The results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local kyphosis correction and vertebral body height restoration. The combination of this technique with laminectomy plus osteosynthesis allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and led to stable results 1 year after surgery. This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple co-morbidities. With a single operation, we can achieve neurological decompression and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV. Therapeutic prospective study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures is controversial regarding short or long segment pedicle screw fixation. Although long level fixation is better, it can decrease one motion segment distally, thus increasing load to lower discs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 31 unstable thoracolumbar fractures with partial or intact neurology. All patients were operated with posterior approach using pedicle screws fixed two levels above and one level below the fracture vertebra. No laminectomy, discectomy or decompression procedure was done. Posterior fusion was achieved in all. Post operative and at final follow-up radiological evaluation was done by measuring the correction and maintenance of kyphotic angle at thoracolumbar junction. Complications were also reported including implant failure. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 34 months. All patients had full recovery at final follow-up. Average kyphosis was improved from 26.7 degrees to 4.1 degrees postoperatively and to 6.3 degrees at final follow-up. And mean pain scale was improved from 7.5 to 3.9 postoperatively and to 1.6 at final follow-up, All patients resumed their activity within six months. Only 4 (12{\%}) complications were noted including only one hardware failure. CONCLUSION: Two levels above and one level below pedicle screw fixation in unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture is useful to prevent progressive kyphosis and preserves one motion segment distally.},

abstract = {Posterior short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fracture is known for a high implant failure rate because of the lack of anterior support. Anterior body augmentation by transpedicular bone grafting has been developed as an alternative to overcome this failure. However, the efficacy of transpedicular bone grafting remains debatable. Between August 2002 and August 2006, 31 patients with a single-level thoracolumbar fracture underwent insertion of posterior short-segment pedicle screws and transpedicular bone grafting. Twenty-one men and 10 women had a mean age of 39.7 years at the time of surgery. All patients were followed up for at least 2 years; the mean follow-up period was 52.7 months. Preoperative computed tomography showed that the mean canal encroachment was 48.1{\%}. The kyphotic angle improved from 20.9 degrees to 3.7 degrees immediately postoperatively. Loss of kyphosis correction was 2.7 degrees before implant removal and 6.2 degrees at final follow-up. The anterior body height was corrected from 50.9{\%} to 86.9{\%} by surgery, but collapsed to 82.2{\%} before implant removal and became 78.1{\%} at final follow-up. The failure of the surgery was defined as an increase of {\textgreater}10 degrees in local kyphosis and/or implant breakage. At last follow-up, no implants had failed, but 3 patients had a loss of correction {\textgreater}10 degrees ; the failure rate was 9.7{\%}. According to the Dennis functional scales, the mean pain score was 1.7, and the mean work score was 2.2 at final follow-up. All 8 patients with partial neurological deficit initially had improvement. Analysis of the results indicated that this technique effectively corrects deformities, restores vertebral height, prevents early implant failure, and provides satisfactory clinical results.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: A retrospective analysis of patients with thoracolumbar junction fractures who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery via a minimally invasive approach (minithoracotomy) for reconstruction of the anterior spinal column. MATERIAL: Between 2002 and 2006, a total of 127 patients were treated by this technique. The age of the group, including 75 men and 52 women, ranged from 18 to 75 years (average, 45.9 years). L1 and Th12 fractures were treated in 71 and 66 patients, respectively. Based on CT scans and operative findings, the fractures were assessed as type A in 81, type B in 42 and type C in four patients. The causes of injury were a fall from height in 72, a pedestrian's fall in 29, a traffic accident in 23 and other in three patients. On admission 19 patients had a neurological deficit of varying degree: Frankel grade A, eight patients; grade B, four; grade C, five; and grade D, two patients. METHODS: The patients were treated by either posterior stabilization and, at the second stage, the minimally invasive technique via an anterior approach, or the minimally invasive anterior procedure alone. Transpedicular posterior stabilization was performed in 52 patients. All of them had an anterior procedure completed with screw-rod-screw stabilization, and the vertebral body was replaced with an allograft or an expandable titanium cage in 50 and two patients, respectively. The anterior approach alone was used in 75 patients, who received a bisegmental angle-stable implant in 43 and a monosegmental plate in 32 cases. To replace the vertebral body, allografts were used in 71 and an expandable titanium cage in four patients. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 3.9 years (range, 1 to 6 years). In the anterior procedure, the average operative time was 90 min (range, 50 to 130 min) and blood loss ranged from 200 ml to 2300 ml. A complication due to deep infection occurred in one patient and required removal of both the anterior and posterior implants. Bony fusion without complications was achieved in all patients within a year of surgery. The loss of correction after the anterior procedure with an allograft or titanium cage was up to 2 degrees at 1-year follow-up. No conversion of the minimally invasive technique to a conventional approach due to visceral or vascular injury was necessary; nor was revision surgery for fluidothorax needed. No loosening of an anterior implant or cage dislocation was recorded. Hypesthesia in the operative wound area was found in four patients (3.1{\%}). Improvement in neurological status by at least one Frankel grade was found in 10 of the 19 affected patients. DISCUSSION: The anterior approach is recommended for reconstruction of the anterior spinal column in burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction in particular. An isolated posterior approach may result in implant failure during bony union or in the loss of correction after implant removal that can lead to the recurrence of kyphosis. Conventional thoracotomy is often associated with significant morbidity and hence there is a need for a minimally invasive approach to treat thoracolumbar junction injury. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive approach (minithoracotomy up to 6-7 cm) combined with thoracoscopy is an alternative to an exclusively endoscopic technique enabling us to provide safe surgical treatment of the anterior spinal column.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the surgical skill, treatment effect and indications for reconstruction of vertebral lamina with skull titanium plate and autograft in the treatment of thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture. METHODS: From March 1999 to April 2007, 33 patients with thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture combined nerve injury were treated by reconstruction of vertebral lamina with skull titanium plate and autograft including 30 males and 3 females with an average age of 41 years ranging from 21 to 66. The fracture involved 3 cases in T11, 9 in T12, 16 in L1, 3 in L2 and 2 in L3. There were 12 cases with flexion fracture, 8 with extension fracture, and 13 with burst fracture. Five cases performed emergency operation and in the others the time from injury to operation was 5 to 12 days. GSS fixation was applied in 25 cases and AF in 8. The volume of vertebral canal, the stability of the spine, the height of vertebrae, and the nerve function were observed before and after operation. RESULTS: These 33 patients were followed up for 1 to 3 years (means 25 months). The height of anterior column of the involved vertebrae changed from 58{\%} to 96{\%}, the cobb angle return from average of 26 degree to 2 degree, the volume of vertebral canal extended from 43{\%} to 92{\%}, respectively, when compared between preoperatively and postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of vertebral lamina with skull titanium plate and autograft which is a simple and safe treatment for thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture can increase the stability of spine and avoid second canal stenosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No consensus has been reached on the optimal radiographic evaluation  of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The role of MRI in the treatment decision is not fully documented. The objectives was to measure the agreement of MRI in detecting posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) and posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) injury, and to determine whether the findings by MRI is correlated with the results of plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) scanning as well as neurological examination and with the treatment planning. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fracture were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of supraspinous ligament (SSL), interspinous ligament (ISL) or posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) injury. The overall interobserver agreement between the three different observers was assessed by a kappa coefficient for multiple raters. The status of ligaments was correlated with the neurological function as assessed by Frankel scale and fracture severity as defined by the Load Sharing Classification. These patients were surgically treated according to the Load Sharing Classification and followed up for at least 5 years. RESULTS: The kappa coefficients for ISL or SSL injury ranged 0.601 to 0.736, representing substantial to almost perfect agreement, whereas the kappa coefficients for PLL injury were 0.441 to 0.574, representing moderate agreement. No significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05) of Frankel scale or load sharing score was found between patients with and without ligamentous injuries. Satisfactory results were achieved in all patients regarding the clinical and radiological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: MRI is reliable for detecting the ligamentous injury, especially PLC injury in thoracolumbar burst fractures but the ligamentous injury as shown by MRI is not correlated with the neurological function or fracture severity. As MRI finding is of little value in treatment planning of thoracolumbar burst fractures, MRI examination is not necessary to be used routinely for excluding occult ligamentous injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of short segmental pedicle screw fixation combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty in treatment of nonadjacent thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: Twenty patients who suffered from nonadjacent thoracolumbar fractures were treated by short segmental pedicle screw fixation for burst fracture and by percutaneous vertebroplasty for compression fracture. X-rays, CT and MRI scans were conducted using the same protocol before and after surgery and during follow-up. Pre-and post-operative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, fusion of fracture sites, visual analog scale (VAS) of back pain, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were accessed. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for an average period of 12 months. The sagittal profile of the thoracolumbar spine was restored satisfactorily. No patient had neurologic deterioration after surgery, and 9 patients with incomplete lesions improved postoperatively by at least one ASIA grade. The fusion rate was 100{\%}. The average VAS of back pain was 7.6 preoperatively and 3.2 postoperatively. The average ODI was 72.5 preoperatively and 35.5 postoperatively.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The intrinsic stability of fractures related to soft tissue injury  and the comminution of the metaphyseal part of the distal radius influence the chance of secondary displacement in distal radial fractures treated conservatively. A low bone mineral density may also contribute to this secondary displacement and could therefore play a role in functional outcome. This possible relation between functional outcome and bone mineral density is poorly studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a unilateral conservatively treated distal radial fracture were assessed one year after their fracture with the DASH score (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) and the Cooney score. Fractures were classified according to the AO classification. Radial inclination, radial shift, radial tilt and ulnar variance were measured on the first and follow-up radiographies. Bone mineral densities of both the hip and lumbar spine were measured by DXA and expressed as T-scores. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients participated in this study (mean age 68 years). Osteoporosis (T-score {\textless}/= -2.5) was present in 20 patients (37{\%}), osteopenia (T-score of -1 to -2.5) in 30 patients (56{\%}), and normal bone density (T-score {\textgreater} -1) in four patients (7{\%}). The distribution of fracture types according to the AO classification showed 32 A-type fractures, eight B-type fractures and 14 C-type fractures. Both univariate linear and multivariate regression analysis with covariates of age, sex, body mass index and AO classification showed no significant correlation between T-score and functional outcome. CONCLUSION: The functional outcome of conservatively treated distal radial fractures in this study does not correlate with bone mineral density. Therefore, BMD measurement cannot be used to predict functional outcome in these patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy in the population rises, osteoporotic fractures  are seen most frequently in the proximal femur and the vertebral column. In balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, we have two minimally invasive treatment procedures available. Although they have both been controversially discussed in studies, they have seldom been directly compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2004, patients with fresh thoracic or lumbar single-segment vertebral compression fractures not involving neurological deficits were treated by balloon kyphoplasty (n = 30) or vertebroplasty(n = 30) using PMMA cement, and the results of the two interventions were compared in a prospective, nonrandomised cohort study. Surgery was indicated when patients had painful, dislocated fractures of type A1 and type A3 according to Magerl's classification. The outcome of treatment was assessed with special reference to the angle of kyphosis, back pain (VAS), health-related quality of life (SF-36) and complications. RESULTS: At the time of the follow-up examination, significant improvement in the angle of kyphosis was found to have been achieved both by kyphoplasty and by vertebroplasty (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Comparison showed that correction of the angle was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) better in the kyphoplasty group. Both surgical procedures led to significant (P {\textless} 0.001) attenuation of the patients' pain; no difference was observed between the groups in the degree of pain relief achieved. There was no demonstrable correlation in either group between the preoperative pain experienced by the patients and the degree of dislocation of their fractures. In both study groups, the quality of life was in keeping with that of a reference group matched for age and sex. Cement leakage was observed in 7{\%} of patients after kyphoplasty and in 33{\%} of patients after vertebroplasty (P = 0.021). Adjacent-level fractures were checked for, but occurred in only one patient in the vertebroplasty group. CONCLUSION: The two surgical procedures were both followed by significant pain relief, and the quality of life was similar regardless of the procedure used. Balloon kyphoplasty led to an ongoing reduction of freshly fractured vertebrae and was followed by a lower rate of cement leakage.},

abstract = {Prolonged physical activities may introduce risks for low back injury due to the  adapted neuromuscular response of the system once neuromuscular fatigue is present. Trunk extensor muscles were fatigued in fourteen healthy women to observe myoelectric changes in the trunk musculature during walking trials performed before and after fatigue conditions. Sub-maximal efforts at 50{\%} and 70{\%} maximal trunk extension effort were performed until the pre-determined levels could not be sustained. Surface electromyography (EMG) from lumbar paraspinal (LP), rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO) muscles were recorded during fatigue conditions and pre and post fatigue walking trials. Infrared sensors were used to time participants as they walked. Footswitches attached to the right heel were used to record heel contacts, and were time synchronized with the EMG signals. LP and RA activity burst peaks shifted in time at contralateral heel contacts (p{\textless}0.05) in the 70{\%} condition, while RA amplitude increased (p{\textless}0.05) and EO burst peak temporal shifts (p{\textless}0.05) were present in the 50{\%} condition. Reduced ability of the paraspinal muscles to support the trunk after fatigue onset may be a contributing factor, lending to diminished spine stiffness in attenuating ground reaction forces.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the spinal injury in Wenchuan earthquake and to investigate its clinical features. METHODS: Data of 146 patients in Wenchuan earthquake with spinal injuries (79 males, 67 females; aged 11-88 years old, average 51 years old) were collected and analyzed epidemiologically. Two patients under 16 years of age, 15 patients with the fractures of spinous process, transverse process or vertebra lamina, 1 patient with spinal fractures of type A2 according to AO classification but no corresponding type in Denis classification, and 9 patients with upper cervical injuries were excluded. The remaining 119 patients were divided into two groups according to their age: group A in which 78 patients were under 60 years of age, including 40 males and 38 females aged 18-58 years old (average 41 years old), and group B in which 41 patients were 60 years of age or above, including 24 males and 17 females aged 60-88 years old (average 71 years old). Analyses for the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The leading causes of spinal injuries were fall from high places (27.40{\%}) and crush by heavy objects (67.81{\%}). According to Denis classification, the major types of spinal injuries were burst fracture (54.62{\%}) and compression fracture (33.61{\%}). Serious nerve injury, defined as grade A, B and C in ASIA neurological function assessment, occurred in 31.51{\%} of patients. The most common injured site was in thoracic or lumbar vertebrae (78.77{\%}), and 52.74{\%} of patients had combined injuries, among which the fractures of limb (30.14{\%}) and rib (19.86{\%}) were the most common. Multi-level spinal fractures happened to 22.60{\%} of patients. Comparative analysis revealed the rate of injury caused by fall from high places in group A (34.62{\%}) was much higher than that in group B (12.20{\%}). The commonest type of fracture in group A was burst fracture (58.97{\%}), and it was compression fracture in group B (48.78{\%}). The rate of serious nerve injury in group B (24.39{\%}) was much lower than that in group A (44.87{\%}). The rate of combined injury and multilevel vertebral body injury in group B was 70.73{\%} and 39.02{\%}, respectively, which was much higher than that in group A (combined injury 43.59{\%}; multilevel vertebral body injury 21.79{\%}). There were significant differences between two groups in all the indicators derived from clinical data (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: In Wenchuan earthquake, the leading causes of spinal injuries are fall from high places and crush by heavy objects, the major types of fracture are compression fracture and burst fracture, and the occurrence rates of spinal injury, combined injury and multilevel vertebral body injury are high.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of measurements of spinal canal narrowing, vertebral body compression, and interpedicular widening in burst fractures in radiography compared with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had confirmed acute vertebral burst fractures over an interval of 34 months underwent both MDCT and radiography. Measurements of spinal canal narrowing, vertebral body compression, and interpedicular widening from MDCT and radiography were compared. RESULTS: The 108 patients (30 female, 78 male, aged 16-79 years, mean 39 years) had 121 burst fractures. Eleven patients had multiple fractures, of which seven were not contiguous. Measurements showed a strong positive correlation between radiography and MDCT (Spearman's rank sum test: spinal canal narrowing k = 0.50-0.82, vertebral compression k = 0.55-0.72, and interpedicular widening k = 0.81-0.91, all P {\textless} 0.05), except for the cervical spine (k = -0.50 to 0.61, with all P {\textgreater} 0.25) and for interpedicular widening in the thoracic spine (k = 0.35, P = 0.115). The average difference in measurements between the modalities was 3 mm or fewer. CONCLUSION: Radiography demonstrates interpedicular widening, spinal canal narrowing and vertebral compression with acceptable precision, with the exception of those of the cervical spine.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term results of short-segment pedicle instrumentation for thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From February 1987 to June 1995, 89 patients with thoracolumbar or lumbar burst fracture were treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation, and 68 (76.4{\%}) of them were followed up for an average of 8.0 years (range, 5-13 years). Radiographs were taken pre- and post- operatively, before implant removal and at final follow-up. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the fractured vertebrae were done on 18 patients, with their consent, at final follow-up. RESULTS: At final follow-up, neurological status had improved at least one grade in the Frankel Grading system in 90.8{\%} patients who had presented incomplete paralysis preoperatively, and low back pain was evaluated as Denis' P(1) in 60.3{\%}, P(2) in 35.3{\%} and P(3) in 4.4{\%} of patients. An average of 2.5 mm (range, 0-6.5 mm) of implant deformation was recorded before implant removal, and implant failure was noted in 11 (16.2{\%}) patients. At final follow-up, loss of correction of the anterior vertebral body height and Cobb angle averaged 1.9{\%} and 12.1 degrees , leaving residual correction rates of 30.5{\%} and 5.8 degrees , respectively. The loss of correction occurred mainly at adjacent disc spaces, and collapse of the vertebral body was more severe at its center. CT scan revealed an obvious gap, which communicated with the adjacent disc space, in the vertebral body of 16 of the 18 patients scanned. Local kyphosis of more than 20 degrees existed in five patients and three of them had low back pain. CONCLUSION: Short-segment pedicle instrumentation provides satisfactory reduction for thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. The relatively high incidence of implant failure and the loss of correction may be caused by various factors, and more adequate fusion is recommended.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some reports have suggested the involvement of the D2 dopaminergic function in the expression of suicidal behavior. Here, we examined associations between suicide attempts and two kinds of functional polymorphisms in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene, namely, TaqIA and -141C Ins/Del. METHODS: Subjects included 120 suicide attempters and 123 unrelated volunteers. Those who attempted suicide were severely injured and were transferred to the emergency unit in our university hospital. To determine each genotype, we performed polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. RESULTS: We found significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies of -141C Ins/Del and TaqIA polymorphisms between suicide attempters and healthy controls (-141C Ins/Del, p = 0.01; TaqIA,p = 0.036). The Ins allele of -141C Ins/Del was significantly more frequent in suicide attempters (p = 0.011), as well as the A2 allele of TaqIA (p = 0.017). Haplotype analysis revealed no significant linkage disequilibrium between -141C Ins/Del and TaqIA polymorphisms (D' = 0.226, r(2) = 0.016, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DRD2 gene polymorphisms may be involved in the biological susceptibility to suicide.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the predictive value of ultrasound diagnostics for the assessment of traumatic lesions of the posterior ligament complex (PLC) in burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. This was a prospective validating cohort study. Judgment about instability and treatment of burst fractures depends on the condition of the PLC. There have been some studies describing underdiagnosis of PLC injuries due to classification problems in ligamentary distraction type fractures. The gold standard for assessing these lesions is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Even then, there are often limits in contemporary operational availability and technical limitations of MRI. Ultrasound was described being an alternative. In a prospective study, 54 levels of 18 patients with acute burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine have been examined by ultrasound and additional MRI scans preoperatively. The condition (intact vs. ruptured) of supraspinous ligament (SSL) and the interspinous ligament has been assessed for the ligaments separately. Hematoma below the SSL has also been evaluated as an indirect sign of an injured PLC. In all the patients the primary performed operative treatment was a posterior spinal instrumentation. Postoperatively the blinded results of the ultrasound procedures have been matched against intraoperative and MRI findings. Assessments of all target structures have been contributed to the calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound. A total of 18 patients, 14 males and 4 females, with acute burst fractures have been qualified for inclusion in the study. The patients' mean age was 43.4 years. Comparing intraoperative findings with preoperatively performed investigations, ultrasound archived a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.75 (P {\textless} 0.05) to detect traumatic lesions to the PLC. As hypothesized the obtained predictive value using ultrasound correlates closely with intraoperative findings. Anyway MRI still seems to be the superior diagnostic method for examining the PLC. However, ultrasound can be considered to be an adequate alternative method in cases with contraindications for MRI such as ferromagnetic side effects, claustrophobia, availability or emergency diagnostics in multiple injuries.},

Fracture morphology, neurologic status, and surgeon preference play major roles in deciding on an anterior, a posterior, or a combined approach. The goal is to optimize neural decompression while providing stable internal fixation over the least number of spinal segments. Short-segment constructs through a single-stage approach (anterior or posterior) have become viable options with advances in instrumentation and techniques. Unstable burst fractures can be treated with anterior-only fixation using a strut graft and a modern thoracolumbar plating system or with a posterior-only construct using pedicle screws and possibly hooks. A circumferential construct is considered for extremely unstable injuries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anatomical course of the Chorda tympani nerve (CTN) in the middle ear is known to be very variable, which becomes most obvious during middle ear operations. As well, postoperative gustatory dysfunction belongs to the most frequent complications after otosurgical interventions. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical classification of the intraoperatively visible course of the CTN and to demonstrate a possible correlation of its anatomic course with the prevalence of actual postoperative taste disorders. METHODS: Only cases of first-time ear surgery all operated by one experienced otosurgeon were assessed. Preoperatively, gustatory testing with standardised chemical solutions (sweet, sour, salty, bitter) was performed. During surgery the course of the CTN was classified at first sight by 3 topografical criteria: The angle (A), the height (H) and the depth (D) of the nerve's emergence from the lateral tympanic wall. In cases of postoperative taste dysfunction the patients were followed-up on a regular basis. RESULTS: 103 patients were included in the study. The angle of the nerve;s emergence from the tympanic bone was below 30 degrees in 59 (A1), between 30 degrees and 60 degrees in 41 (A2) and within 60 degrees and 90 degrees in 3 cases (A3). The height of emergence was 33 times in the superior (H1), 61 times in the middle (H2) and 9 times in the inferior third (H3) of the posterior meatal wall. The depth of emergence lay within the plain of the tympanic sulcus in 26 individuals (D1), 44 times medially to this plain without overlapping bone (D2) and 33 times medially but covered by a bony spur (D3). The CTN was preserved in 92 procedures. Postoperatively, gustatory function was diminished in 7{\%} of the cases. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high diversity of the surgical anatomy of the CTN. According to the proposed classification the A1-H1-D2/3-situation belongs to the CTN-constellations observed most frequently. It is this very anatomical situation, that apparently tends to be associated with postoperative taste deficits quite regularly due to inevitable intraoperative manipulations. Taking into account the results of this study an otosurgeon might be able to anticipate the potential risk for the CTN by judging the AHD-status intraoperatively and - therefore - reduce taste disorders postoperatively. Additionally, the probability of a postoperative gustatory dysfunction depends upon the kind of underlying middle ear disease as well.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and effect of the technique of reconstructing anterior and middle columns by posterior approach in treating lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From July 2005 to January 2007, 22 cases (18 males and 4 females, aged 28-57 years, 42.7 years on average) of lumbar burst fractures were treated with surgical procedures in our hospital. Based on the routine posterior approach, one of the transverse processes of the injured vertebra was incised to get access to the lateral side of the injured vetebral body. After all the displaced fracture fragments were cleared away and the spinal canal was decompressed, the titanium mesh packed with autografts was implanted from the lateral side to reconstruct the anterior and middle columns. The adjacent above and below segments of the vetebral body were fixed with transpedicular screws. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, vertebral height, degree of kyphotic deformity and comprised spinal canal were documented. RESULTS: The average operation time was 3.5 hours (ranging 2.8-5.8 hours) and the average blood loss was 820 ml (ranging 650-2 100 ml). All the cases were followed up for 17.2 months on average ( ranging 12-28 months). The height of the injured vetebral body was restored from 24 {\%} (12{\%}- 45{\%}) preoperatively to 96{\%} (95{\%}-99{\%}) postoperatively (P less than 0.05). The natural spinal curvatures and spinal canal were restored. Three cases were involved in transient iatrogenic nerve root injury and 1 case was involved in the loosening of the connected rod of the pedicle screw system 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of implanting the titanium mesh by posterior approach is effective and safe enough to reconstruct the anterior and middle columns in treating lumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of using transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty for aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures with an in vitro model. METHODS: Simulated osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures were created in 11 vertebral bodies. The burst fractures without obvious canal occupation were confirmed by spiral CT before the procedure. This operation involved the percutaneous insertion of two inflatable bone tamps into a fractured vertebral body transpedicularly under fluoroscopic guidance. Inflation of the bone tamp elevated the endplates, restored the vertebral body height, while created a cavity to be filled with bone cement. Preoperative and postoperative heights were measured, preoperative and postoperative sagittal diameter of vertebral canals were measured, and the repaired vertebral bodies were compressed to determine strength and stiffness values. The cement distribution and extravasation was evaluated by spiral CT after the procedure. RESULTS: The transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty resulted in the significant restoration of the vertebral body height. The mean vertebral body heights was (20.73 +/- 1.37) mm before operation and (24.82 +/- 1.61) mm after operation (P {\textless} 0.01). Preoperative and postoperative sagittal diameter of vertebral canals were similar (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The cement distribution was regular, and the extravasation into spinal cannula was found in one case. The preoperative strength was significantly larger than the postoperative strength, whereas the postoperative stiffness was significantly less than the preoperative stiffness (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty is an effective way to treat aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures without obvious canal occupations and neurologic deficit in vitro. The procedure can increase strength and restore height of aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. Cement distribution and vertebral canal stenosis can be avoided.},

Part I described in detail the epidemiologic data of the patient collective and the subgroups, whereas part II analyzed the different methods of treatment and radiologic findings. The study period covered the years 2002 to 2006 including a 30-month follow-up period from 01.01.2004 until 31.05.2006. Follow-up data of 638 (74{\%}) patients were collected with a new internet-based database system and analyzed. Results in part III will be presented on the basis of the same characteristic treatment subgroups (OP, KONS, PLASTIE) and surgical treatment subgroups (Dorsal, Ventral, Kombi) in consideration of the level of injury (thoracic spine, thoracolumbar junction, lumbar spine). After the initial treatment and discharge from hospital, the average duration of subsequent inpatient rehabilitation was 4 weeks, which lasted significantly longer in patients with persistent neurologic deficits (mean 10.9 weeks) or polytraumatized patients (mean 8.6 weeks). Following rehabilitation on an inpatient basis, subsequent outpatient rehabilitation lasted on average 4 months. Physical therapy was administered significantly longer to patients with neurologic deficits (mean 8.7 months) or type C injuries (mean 8.6 months). The level of injury had no influence of the duration of the inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation. A total of 382 (72.2{\%}) patients who were either operated from posterior approach only or in a combined postero-anterior approach had an implant removal after an average 12 months. During the follow-up period 56 (8.8{\%}) patients with complications were registered and of these 18 (2.8{\%}) had to have surgical revision. The most common complications reported were infection, loss of correction, or implant-associated complications. Clinical data showed a 2.9 higher relative risk for smokers compared to non-smokers to suffer from wound healing problems. The neurologic status of 81 (60.4{\%}) out of 134 patients with neurologic deficits at the time of injury improved until follow-up. Neurologic deterioration was documented in 8 (1.3{\%}) cases. Complete neurologic deficits after injury to the thoracic spine improved in 9{\%} of the cases, whereas 59{\%} of the cases with complete neurologic deficit improved after injury to the thoracolumbar junction. The surgical approach (posterior or combined postero-anterior) had no significant influence on neurological results at follow-up. Patient age, sex and neurologic deficits showed a statistically significant influence (p{\textless}0.05) on the fingertip-floor distance (FBA) at follow-up. Patient back function improved during the follow-up period. More than 2 years after the time of injury 32.2{\%} of the patients had no complaints with respect to back function. The relative frequency of patients with unrestrained back function was greater after posterior surgery (24.2{\%}), than anterior surgery (13.8{\%}), or combined surgery (17.3{\%}) (p=0.005; chi(2)-test). At follow-up there were no statistically significant differences of unrestrained back function between different levels of injury (thoracic spine 17.4{\%}, TL junction 22.5{\%} and lumbar spine 13.6{\%}). The relative frequency of patients with injury to the thoracolumbar junction who reported "no complaints from the anterior approach" at follow-up, was calculated to be 55.6{\%} after open versus 63.8{\%} after endoscopic approaches with no significant differences. Of the patients 56.3{\%} reported no donor site morbidity following iliac crest bone harvesting. The VAS spine score at follow-up was calculated within different treatment subgroups: OP 58.4 points, KONS 59.8 points, and PLASTIE 59.7 points. Statistically significant differences of the VAS spine score between posterior (64.9 points) versus combined surgery (47.8 points) were only verified at the level of injury of the thoracic spine (p=0.004). The relative frequency of patients regaining at least 80{\%} of the initial score level was OP (posterior 60.4{\%}, anterior 61.1{\%}, combined 51.4{\%}), 52.9{\%} KONS and 67.6{\%} PLASTIE. After surgery the mean period of incapacity from work was 4 months. Patients with a sedentary occupation before the time of injury were fully reintegrated into work in 71.1{\%} of the cases. Patients with a physical occupation were fully reintegrated in 38.9{\%} of the cases at follow-up. At follow-up 87 (31.2{\%}) patients after posterior and 50 (20.1{\%}) after combined surgery had no restrictions to their recreational activities (p=0.001). Treatment subgroups PLASTIE and KONS show a similar radiological result at follow-up with a bisegmental kyphotic deformity (GDW) of -9 degrees and -8.5 degrees, respectively. With all operative methods it was possible to correct or partly correct the posttraumatic kyphotic deformity. Until follow-up there was a loss of correction depending on the surgical approach and level of injury. Combined postero-anterior stabilization gave statistically significant better radiological results with less kyphotic deformity (-3.8 degrees) than posterior stabilization alone (-6.1 degrees) (p=0.005; ANOVA). Thus combined surgery was superior in its capability to restore spinal alignment within the observational period. At follow-up the use of titanium vertebral body replacement implants (cages) to reconstruct and support the anterior column showed significantly better radiological results with less kyphotic deformity and loss of correction (GDW 0.3 degrees) than the use of iliac bone strut grafts (-3.7 degrees ) (p{\textless}0.001). Neither additional anterior plates nor the combination of anterior plates with a cage or bone graft had a statistically significant influence on the kyphotic deformity measured at follow-up. A matched-pair analysis of anterior surgery alone versus combined surgery for the treatment of compression fractures (type A) at the thoracolumbar junction showed a significantly greater intraoperative blood loss but better radiological results in terms of monosegmental and bisegmental kyphotic deformity after combined surgery (p{\textless}0.05). A matched-pair analysis of treatment results between non-operative and operative treatment for burst fractures (type A3.1-2) showed a period of inability to work (6 months) which was twice as long for the non-operative treatment group. At the same time significantly better radiological results at follow-up were achieved after operative treatment of these fractures (p{\textless}0.05).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the correlations and effects of age, gender and cause of accident on the type of vertebral fracture and fracture distribution, as well as on the likelihood to sustain an associated injury or neurological deficit. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 562 patients with a traumatic fracture of the spine. Each patient was analysed by reviewing the medical records, the initial radiographs and CT-scans. SETTING: Level 1 trauma centre from 01/1996 to 12/2000. RESULTS: The most common cause of accident was a high-energy fall (39{\%}), followed by traffic accidents (26.5{\%}). While fall related fractures were evenly distributed over the whole spine, traffic accidents induced significantly more fractures of the cervical and thoracic spine. Sixty-five percent of all cervical spine fractures and 80{\%} of the multisegmental injuries were accompanied by an associated injury. The highest incidence of associated injuries was observed in patients with multilevel fractures (96.5{\%}). Patients with a concomitant injury were more likely to sustain a spinal cord lesion. Sixty-three (11.2{\%}) patients exhibited a complete motor and sensory deficit, 76 (13.5{\%}) an incomplete and 423 (75.3{\%}) no neurological deficit. The highest number of complete motor and sensory neurological deficits was found in cervical spine fractures (19.7{\%}). The majority of patients, 308 (54.8{\%}), sustained a compression fracture, 95 (16.9{\%}) a distraction fracture, and 104 (18.5{\%}) patients experienced a rotational fracture. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates correlations between the cause of accident, the type of spinal fracture and the fracture distribution. Using the AO classification, the likelihood to sustain either associated and/or spinal cord injuries, is predictable.},

METHODS: A total of 93 MS patients (62 females; 31 males) and 122 healthy controls underwent HLA typing and testing for antibodies against EBV. The MS patients underwent brain MRI and quantitative measurements of T1- and T2-lesion volumes (LVs) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) were obtained. There were 54 MS cases that underwent MRI and EBV-antibody assessments at the 3-year follow-up. The anti-EBV panel included measurements of the levels of anti-EBV early antigen (EA) IgG, anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG and anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM and anti-EBV VCA IgG. The relationships between HLA alleles, anti-EBV antibody levels, MRI and clinical parameters were assessed in regression analysis. RESULTS: The presence of HLA B7 was associated with increased T1-LV and trends indicating increased anti-EBV VCA IgG levels, higher disability (EDSS) and more destructive MRI parameters (increased T2-LV and decreased BPF). The presence of HLA A2 was associated with lower EDSS and a trend toward decreased anti-EBV VCA IgG levels; the associations with MRI variables were not significant. The HLA B7-A2 haplotype was significantly associated with higher T2-LV and T1-LV and a trend toward lower BPF was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that gene-environment interactions between specific HLA Class I loci and EBV exposure are associated with MRI markers of lesion injury and brain atrophy in MS patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unreamed tibia nails with small diameters are increasingly used for fracture fixation. However, little is known about the fatigue strength of proximal and distal interlocking screws in those nails. To date, no data are available reporting on mechanical differences of solid compared to cannulated tibial nails. The aim of this study was to assess the fatigue strength of proximal and distal interlocking screws of solid and cannulated small diameter tibia nails. METHODS: We created a distal tibia fracture model (AO/OTA 43 A3) using 16 Sawbones. After fracture stabilization with one of four different nail types (Expert Tibial Nail, VersaNail, T2 Tibial Nailing System, Connex), mechanical testing was performed in three loading series (40,000 cycles each) with incremental loads. Timing and type of interlocking screw failure were assessed. FINDINGS: Interlocking screw failure was observed significantly earlier (after a mean interval of 57,042 cycles) in cannulated tibial nails (VersaNail, T2) compared to solid nails (after a mean interval of 88,415 cycles; P {\textless} 0.001). Proximal interlocking screw failure was recorded if oblique screws were used proximally (VersaNail, T2, Connex). No distal interlocking screw failure was recorded in the Connex nail. Two- and three-part fractures of proximal or distal interlocking screws were observed in all specimen. INTERPRETATION: Proximal and distal interlocking screw failure has to be considered in small diameter nails in case of delayed fracture healing. To support our results, further experimental studies and clinical series are necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which involves injecting polymethylmethacrylate into the compressed vertebral body. At present the indications include the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures, vertebral myeloma, and metastases. The value of vertebroplasty in osteoporotic compression fracture has been discussed comprehensively. The surgical operation for burst fractures without neurological deficit remains controversial. Some authors have asserted that vertebroplasty is contraindicated in patients with burst fracture. However, we performed the procedure, after considering the patents general condition, to reduce surgical risks and the duration of immobilisation. The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical outcomes, kyphosis correction, wedge angle, and height restoration of thoraco-lumbar osteoporotic burst fractures treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with osteoporotic burst fracture were treated with postural reduction followed by vertebroplasty. We measured the kyphosis, wedge angle, spinal canal compromise and the height of the fractured vertebral body initially, after postural reduction, and after vertebroplasty. FINDINGS: The average height of the collapsed vertebral bodies was 24.8{\%} of the original height. Average kyphosis angle was 19.4 degrees and average wedge angle was 19.8 degrees at first. Mean canal encroachment was initially 25.1{\%}. Kyphosis angle, wedge angle, and anterior, middle, and posterior height improved significantly after the procedure. The mean amelioration of the spinal canal encroachment after vertebroplasty was 23.3{\%}. The average increase in anterior vertebral body height was 7.5 mm, central was 5.8 mm, and posterior was 0.9 mm. The mean reduction in kyphosis angle was 6.8 degrees and the mean reduction in wedge angle was 9.7 degrees . CONCLUSION: Although vertebroplasty has been considered as contraindicated in thoraco-lumbar burst fractures, we successfully used the procedure as a safe treatment in patients with osteoporotic burst fracture without neurologic deficit. This method could eliminate the need for and risks of major spinal surgery. We would like to offer it as a relatively safe and effective methods of management in thoraco-lumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study on selected consecutive patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an innovative operative technique called monosegmental transpedicular fixation for the treatment of some thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is accepted by many spinal surgeons as an acceptable technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Preoperative evaluation using the spinal load-sharing makes this technique more reliable. To preserve more motion segments, some authors have advocated using monosegmental pedicle screw instrumentation (MSPI) to treat thoracolumbar fractures. However, up until now this kind of maneuver is only performed in cases of flexion distraction injuries. METHODS: A cohort of 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures fulfilling the inclusion criteria were prospectively submitted to surgical treatment of monosegmental transpedicular fixation plus posterior fusion. All instrumentations were performed with pedicle screws inserted bilaterally into the fractured level and 1 adjacent level, either superior or inferior depending on the locating side of the intact endplate. All patients were followed up. The preoperative radiographs, the postoperative radiographs within 1 week of operation, and the radiographs of the most recent follow-up were evaluated for kyphosis correction recorded in the Sagittal Index and Load-Sharing Classification (LSC) index. The postoperative functional outcomes were evaluated using the Frankel Performance Scale together with the Denis Pain Scale. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were followed up successfully with an average final follow-up of 24.7+/-8.0 months. The focal kyphotic angulations were corrected satisfactorily with the mean Sagittal Index of preoperative 16.5+/-6.6 degrees, initial postoperative 4.0+/-2.4 degrees, and latest follow-up 4.8+/-4.0 degrees. No obvious loss of correction occurred except for 2 patients who both scored 8 points on the LSC Score. Postoperatively, most patients attained both functional neurologic improvement and pain relief, and only a few complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: For selected thoracolumbar burst fractures, MSPI can provide the same or better fixation and preserve more motion segments than other methods of posterior pedicle instrumentation. With preoperative evaluation using the spinal LSC system, MSPI is effective and reliable for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures when properly indicated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical results of simultaneously combined anterior and posterior surgery for severe thoracolumbar fracture dislocations, and to clarify the surgical indications for these high-energy injuries. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with severe thoracolumbar fracture dislocations were managed with simultaneously combined anterior and posterior surgery. The injured segments included the following: T11 (2 patients), T12 (5), L1 (1), L2 (8), L3 (5), L4 (2) and L4 and L5 (1). When classified according to the Magerl Classification, the breakdown was as follows: 12 A3 injuries, 2 B1, 2 B2, 12 C1 injuries, 4 C2, and 2 C3. Clinical data, including operative procedures, neurological changes, postoperative CT scans and sequential radiographs, was collected and analyzed. Thirty-two patients were followed up for an average of 13 months (range, 6-60). RESULTS: Operative time ranged from 180 to 320 min with a mean of 230 min. Intraoperative blood loss ranged from 900 to 2400 ml with a mean of 1200 ml. According to the classification of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), neurological status improved at least 1 grade in all of the 24 patients who had an incomplete paralysis preoperatively. Satisfactory decompressions, reductions and reconstructions were obtained and well maintained in all patients at all intervals of follow-up. CONCLUSION: For severe thoracolumbar fracture dislocations that cannot be effectively treated with either an anterior or posterior approach alone, simultaneously combined anterior and posterior surgery is a reliable method that can achieve a sufficient decompression, reduction and reconstruction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical and radiologic follow-up of patients with osteoporosis with painful, traumatic A3-type vertebral compression fractures in the thoracic and lumbar spine. DESIGN: Prospective study over the period of 1 year. SETTING: Level I Trauma Center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Twenty-five patients with osteoporosis (14 women and 11 men) and painful, traumatic A3-type fractures were treated with Balloon Kyphoplasty in combination with a short-segment posterior fixation (using the Universal Spine System). Twenty-one patients returned for their 1-year follow-up visit. X-rays were taken preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3, 6, and 12 months' follow-up to evaluate vertebral height and local Cobb angle. Pain was measured using the self-reporting Visual Analogue pain Scale (VAS). Disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability questionnaire (ODI). RESULTS: The mean pain score (VAS) improved significantly from pretreatment to posttreatment from 7.8 +/- 2.2 (5.6-10) to 4.9 +/- 2.1 (2.8-8.0) (P {\textless} 0.001). It improved further to 2.9 +/- 1.4 (2.1-4.3) at 3 months and increased slightly after 1 year (3.8 +/- 1.9) (1.9-4.7). Limitation of daily activities (ODI) improved significantly from 88{\%} (78-100) to 35{\%} (15-48) at 3 months (P {\textless} 0.05). Improvement was maintained at 1 year at 36.5{\%} (10-42). At 1-year follow-up, maintenance of the height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction was found. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon Kyphoplasty in combination with short-segment posterior instrumentation in traumatic A3 vertebral fractures led to a significant reduction in pain and disability. The combination of both surgical techniques was able to restore and maintain vertebral body height and correction of angular deformity. This technique might offer important safety advantages over an invasive anterior-posterior approach.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a calcium phosphate cement (CaP) in balloon kyphoplasty if compared to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, PMMA currently represents the standard in augmentation materials. It is characterized, however, by a lack of osseointegration and limited biocompatibility. Consequently, CaP is currently being investigated as an alternative material for vertebral augmentation. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were 1 or 2 adjacent osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies in the thoracolumbar spine, patient age {\textgreater} or =65 years, and fracture age {\textless} or =4 months. Exclusion criteria were tumor lesions and additional posterior instrumentation. RESULTS: A total of 60 osteoporotic vertebral body fractures in 56 patients were included. CaP and PMMA were randomly applied in 30 vertebrae each with 2-fracture-patients receiving only 1 type of cement for both vertebrae. All 60 fractures were classified compression fractures (type A). Of these, 27 were classified burst fractures (type A3). 52/56 patients experienced statistically significant pain relief (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 1.8 +/- 2.1 on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 "best" to 10 "worst"). Bisegmental endplate angles were restored by 6.2 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees on average. Complications that turned out to be cement-specific were: vascular embolism (n = 2) for PMMA; subtotal cement washout (n = 1); and radiographic loss of correction (n = 9) due to cement failure in burst fractures for CaP. There was no case of cement failure, when PMMA had been used. CONCLUSION: The routine use of the CaP tested is not currently recommended for kyphoplasty. Because of its low resistance against flexural, tractive, and shear forces compared to PMMA, in certain constellations (burst fractures), there is a higher risk of cement failure and subsequent loss of correction.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was performed. OBJECTIVE: To assess an unusual  technique for corpectomy and expandable cage placement via single-stage posterior approach in acute thoracic or lumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures represent 10{\%} to 20{\%} of all spine injuries at or near the thoracolumbar junction, and can cause neurologic complications and kyphotic deformity. The goal of surgical intervention is to decompress the neural elements, restore vertebral body height, correct angular deformity, and stabilize the columns of the spine. METHODS: The study comprised 14 patients (8 women and 6 men aged 40.3 years) who had 1 spinal burst fracture between T8 and L4 and who underwent single-stage posterior corpectomy, circumferential reconstruction with expandable-cage placement, and transpedicle screwing between January 2003 and May 2005. Neurologic status was classified using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and functional outcomes were analyzed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. The kyphotic angle (alpha) and lordotic angle (beta) were measured in the thoracic or thoracolumbar and lumbar regions, respectively. RESULTS.: The mean follow-up time was 24 months (range, 12-48 months). Neurologic status was in 7 patients (preop: ASIA-E, postop: unchanged), 2 patients (preop: ASIA-D, postop: 1 unchanged, 1 improved to ASIA-E), 3 patients (preop: ASIA-C, postop: 2 improved to ASIA-D, 1 improved to ASIA-E), 2 patients (preop: ASIA-B, postop: 1 improved to ASIA-C, 1 unchanged). The mean operative time was 187.8 minutes. The mean blood loss was 596.4 mL. Regarding postoperative complications, 1 patient experienced transient worsening of neurologic deficits and 1 patient developed pseudarthrosis. The mean preoperative VAS score was 8.21 and the mean postoperative VAS score was 2.66 (P {\textless} 0.05). The mean preoperative kyphotic angle for the 11 individuals with the thoracic or thoracolumbar burst fractures was 24.6 degrees and the mean preoperative lordotic angle for the 3 individuals with lumbar burst fractures was 10.6 degrees. The corresponding values at 12 months postsurgery were 17.1 degrees and 13.6 degrees. CONCLUSION: This single-stage posterior approach for acute thoracic and lumbar burst fractures offers some advantages over the classic combined anterior-posterior approach. The results from this small series suggest that a single-stage posterior approach should be considered in select cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation without anterior column reconstruction is associated with a high rate of screw breakage and progressive loss of reduction. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the functional, neurologic, and radiographic results following transpedicular, balloon-assisted fracture reduction with anterior column reconstruction with use of calcium phosphate bone cement combined with short-segment posterior instrumentation and a laminectomy. METHODS: A consecutive series of thirty-eight patients with an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture with or without neurologic deficit were managed with transpedicular, balloon-assisted fracture reduction, calcium phosphate bone cement reconstruction, and short-segment spinal instrumentation from 2002 to 2005. Twenty-eight of the thirty-eight patients were followed for a minimum of two years. Demographic data, neurologic function, segmental kyphosis, the fracture severity score, canal compromise, the Short Form-36 score, the Oswestry Disability Index score, and treatment-related complications were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: All thirteen patients with incomplete neurologic deficits had improvement by at least one Frankel grade. The mean kyphotic angulation improved from 17 degrees preoperatively to 7 degrees at the time of the latest follow-up, and the loss of vertebral body height improved from a mean of 42{\%} preoperatively to 14{\%} at the time of the latest follow-up. Screw breakage occurred in two patients, and pseudarthrosis occurred in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that excellent reduction of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with and without associated neurologic deficits can be maintained with use of short-segment instrumentation and a transpedicular balloon-assisted reduction combined with anterior column reconstruction with calcium phosphate bone cement performed through a single posterior incision. The resultant circumferential stabilization combined with a decompressive laminectomy led to maintained or improved neurologic function in all patients with neurologic deficits, with a low rate of instrumentation failure and loss of correction.},

The mean age of patients was 50.83 years, ranging from 13 to 83 years, being 20 male and 16 female subjects. The treatment outcome was evaluated based on the SF-36 questionnaire, on Denis scores for pain and work and Frankel clinical and neurological scale. The quantification of pain was based on the visual analogue scale for pain. The measurement of the residual kyphosis was obtained by the Cobb method at admission and at the end of the follow-up. RESULTS: A weak positive correlation (r = 0.563; p {\textgreater} 0.001) was found between residual kyphosis and pain score (EVA). No correlation was found between final kyphosis and SF-36 and Denis scores (p {\textgreater} 0.05).

METHODS: In the study, 41 patients with severe burst fractures of thoracolumbar vertebra complicated with spinal stenosis were treated with recapping laminoplasty. After the treatment, the size of vertebral canal, spinal stability, altitude recovery of vertebral body and rehabilitation of nerve function were observed. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up and the duration ranged from 1 to 3 years. The anterior height of compressed vertebral bodies restored from preoperative 58{\%} to postoperative 97{\%}, posterior height was from preoperative 76{\%} to postoperative 98.7{\%}. The Cobb angle was corrected from preoperative 24.6 degrees to postoperative 1.8 degrees, and the size of vertebral canal restored from preoperative 43{\%} to postoperative 93{\%}. According to Frankel classification, 1 patient who were at A grade had no changes and others improved by 1 to 3 degrees. CONCLUSION: This is an ideal operation method for treating burst fractures of thoracolumbar vertebra with spinal stenosis, which is simple, safe and enlarging vertebral canal, at the same time completely decompressing the dura mater and nerve roots. This method eliminated secondary spinal stenosis, reconstructed posterior column and increased spinal stability.},

METHODS: Through the retrospective analysis of 23 patients (31 vertebraes) of middle-upper thoracic fracture and dislocation included 21 male and 2 female,aged from 20 to 47 years in average of 33.5 years. The location and type of fractures were as follows: 2 in T2, 2 in T3, 5 in T4, 6 in T5, 10 in T6, 4 in T7, 2 in T8. Three cases were compression fractures, 7 burst fractures, 9 fracture-dislocations, 4 burst-dislocations. RESULTS: After a followed-up from 3 to 48 months, average 25.5 months, all cases had no serious complications. Anterior height of affected vertebral bodies had been restored from 40.4{\%} to 90.3{\%} after operation. Patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries improved one to two grades according to ASIA grade of spinal cord injury. Patients with complete spinal cord injuries improved 21.7 scores on average according to Sensory and Motion Scores.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients suffering from burst thoracolumbar fractures with anterior and median column injury (male 22 and female 12, aged from 20 to 63,with an average of 40.5 years) were treated by anterior decompression and reconstruction from May 2001 to October 2006. Operative duration, bleeding and the neurological function of patients were recorded. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up from 3 to 60 months and the average time was 24.5 months. Operative duration was (178 +/- 65) min. The volume of bleeding was (1 750 +/- 950) ml and the volume of autotransfusion was (950 +/- 750) ml. Cobb angle were corrected from 27.0 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees to 3.0 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees. All fractures obtained fusion. No failure of internal fixation and formation of false joint happened. CONCLUSION: The technique of anterior decompression and reconstruction for burst thoracolumbar fractures with anterior and median column injury is effective, with which the decompression and reconstruction of the spinal stability can be performed under direct vision at one stage, and the sagittal alignment can be corrected at the same time. The procedure will be more smoothly by the application of the intraoperative autotransfusion.},

Its main objective is the evaluation and optimization of the operative treatment for traumatic spinal injuries. The authors present the results of the second prospective internet-based multicenter study (MCS II) of the AG WS in three consecutive parts: epidemiology, surgical treatment and radiologic findings and follow-up results. The aim of the study was to update and review the state-of-the art for treatment of spinal fractures for thoracic and lumbar spine (T1-L5) injuries in German-speaking countries: which lesions will be treated with which procedure and what differences can be found in the course of treatment and the clinical and radiological outcome? This present first part of the study outlines the new study design and concept of an internet-based data collection system. The epidemiologic findings and characteristics of the three major treatment subgroups of the study collective will be presented: operative treatment (OP), non-operative treatment (KONS), and patients receiving a kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty without additional instrumentation (PLASTIE). A total of 865 patients (OP n=733, KONS n=52, PLASTIE n=69, other n=7) from 8 German and Austrian trauma centers were included. The main causes of accidents in the OP subgroup were motor vehicle accidents 27.1{\%} and trivial falls 15.8{\%} (KONS 55.8{\%}, PLASTIE 66.7{\%}). The Magerl/AO classification scheme was used and 548 (63.3{\%}) compression fractures (type A), 181 (20.9{\%}) distraction injuries (type B), and 136 (15.7{\%}) rotational injuries (type C) were diagnosed. Of the fractures 68.8{\%} were located at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2). Type B and type C injuries carried a higher risk for concomitant injuries, neurological deficits and additional vertebral fractures. The average initial VAS spine score, representing the status before the trauma, varied between treatment subgroups (OP 80, KONS 75, PLASTIE 72) and declined with increasing patient age (p{\textless}0.01).},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Both fractures of the lumbar spine and at the thoracolumbar junction are quite common. The treatment of these fracture types is discussed controversially. Some authors advocate surgical treatment even in fractures without neurologic compromise while other series report good results after non-operative treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and April 2004, 324 patients with spinal fractures were admitted to our institution. Hundred and thirty-six patients with compression and burst type fractures treated by closed reduction and casting were available for follow-up. Their medical records, radiographs and computer tomography scans were reviewed and their functional status was assessed. RESULTS: 94 male (69.1{\%}) and 42 female (30.9{\%}) patients with a mean age of 48.6 years (range 17-81) at time of injury were included. The thoracolumbar junction (T11-L1) was affected in 104 patients (76.5{\%}). 23.5{\%} had lumbar fractures. All of the burst type fractures with involvement of the posterior column affection were type A3.3. fractures according to the Magerl classification. Significant correction of radiographic parameters was achieved in the early postreduction period (P {\textless} 0.0001). Reduction could not be maintained at the final follow-up but still showed slight improvement compared to the initial presentation. Reduction could be maintained better in the thoracolumbar region than in the lumbar spine. Neurologic function was restored in all patients with unilateral radicular pain but only one patient recovered fully after cauda equina-syndrome. Patients after lumbar spine indicated a higher level of pain when compared to patients with fractures at the thoracolumbar junction. DISCUSSION: Closed reduction and casting is a safe and effective method for treatment of compression and burst type fractures at the thoracolumbar junction and can restore neurologic function in patients with unilateral radicular pain. It is of limited value in lumbar fractures and in burst type fractures with posterior column involvement.},

abstract = {AIM: Circumferential reconstruction of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is most frequently performed in two sessions. The authors assessed feasibility, safety and results of a surgical technique in which the use of a small cage allows a less invasive strategy. In addition, since the authors perform urgent decompression in specific cases of spinal cord injury, feasibility of this technique in emergency was verified. METHODS: In two Neurosurgical Departments, between May 2001 and May 2006, 62 patients with thoracic or lumbar fractures were operated on using this technique. X-rays were performed postoperatively and around 45 days from surgery. Three-dimension-computed tomography (3D-CT) scans were performed at 3, 6 and 12 months. Neurological evaluations were repeated at every outpatient visit. After screw insertion at the adjacent levels and traditional transpedicular circumferential decompression, further bone is removed to excavate a niche in the vertebral body and the contiguous discs are removed. The expandable cage, filled with bone fragments, is inserted horizontal or oblique laterally to the sac and applied vertical inside that niche and then expanded. The circumferential stabilization is completed with bone grafting and posterior instrumentation. RESULTS: 3D-CT scans showed sound fusion and no manifest correction loss. Nineteen patients improved at least one grade in the ASIA scale and 11 gained neuromeric levels. CONCLUSION: This technique, fairly undemanding and feasible also in emergency, proved to be safe and resistant. Two-year follow-up demonstrated thriving fusion and steady alignment. It is a valuable surgical therapy to selected cases of burst fracture.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study to review patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures who were conservatively treated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy of conservative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures in terms of long-term results, and to determine whether the long-term results of conservative treatment would be predicted by the Load Sharing Classification. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal management of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial, with advocates for nonoperative or operative approaches. Different criteria for treatment options have been advocated for classifying the fractures, guiding treatment decision-making, and predicting the prognosis. METHODS: A total of 127 patients with an acute thoracolumbar burst fracture (Denis type B) were treated conservatively. Their Load Sharing score ranged from 3 to 9 (average, 5.3). Twenty-two (17.3{\%}) of these patients presented with a neurologic deficit. They were followed up for at least 3 years (range, 3-12 years; average, 7.2 years) and assessed for clinical and radiologic outcomes. The motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, and Denis pain and work scales were used for clinical evaluation, whereas the loss of kyphosis correction (LKC) for the local kyphosis angle was examined for radiologic outcome. RESULTS: None of the patients had neurologic deterioration during the reduction. All 22 patients with neurologic deficit experienced improvement with average recovery rate of 93{\%}. Significant correlation (P {\textless} 0.05) was found between the Load Sharing score on admission and the LKC for local kyphosis angle at final follow-up. Most patients reported acceptable results regarding pain (111/127, 87.4{\%}) and work (110/127, 86.6{\%}). A positive correlation was found between the LKC and the severity of pain (r = 0.194, P {\textless} 0.05). Seven patients (5.5{\%}) required or had undergone late surgery for correction of loss-related back pain and/or poor functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment is safe and effective for selected patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, even in some cases with neurologic deficit. The Load Sharing Classification could be used for guiding the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures not only in surgical approach choice but also in surgical decision-making.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The aim of this work was to study the technique of percutaneous osteosynthesis of lumbar and thoracolumbar spine fractures without neurological deficit and to report preliminary results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 15 patients with lumbar or thoracolumbar spine fractures who were treated between January 2004 and January 2006 by percutaneous osteosynthesis. There were seven men and eight women, mean age 36 years (range 16-58 years). The Magerl classification (AO) was A1 (n=4), A2 (n=1), A3 (n=9), B2 (n=1). Levels were T12 (n=1), L1 (n=10), L2 (n=2), L3 (n=1), L4 (n=1). A specific instrument set was used to insert a short fixation using two pedicular screws on either side of the fractured vertebra and two prebent 5.5mm rods introduced with an aiming device. The operation was performed under fluoroscopy. Ten patients wore a removable corset. The upright position was allowed if there were no other injuries. Computed-tomography scans were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively and at two years follow-up. Function was assessed with the Oswestry score. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 108 minutes (range 40-180 minutes). None of the patients with an isolated spinal injury required blood transfusion. Mean hospital stay was 12 days (range 4-28). Results were expressed for 13 patients whose operations were exclusively percutaneous. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range 6-30). The visual analog scale (VAS) was 1.6/10. The mean Oswestry score was 16. Three quarters of the patients resumed their occupational activities. None of the patients was dissatisfied. Mean vertebral kyphosis (VK) improved from 16 to 8.1 degrees , corrected regional angle (CRA) from 12 to 2.5 degrees at last follow-up. Loss of correction at last follow-up was 1.1 degrees for VK and 2.5 degrees for CRA. The rate of pedicle screw malposition was 3.8{\%}. There were no cases of disassembly nor material failure. There were no infections. None of the implants had to be removed. DISCUSSION: Percutaneous osteosynthesis of the spine is technically feasible, but requires considerable experience. Functional and subjective results have been good. The loss of correction at last follow-up has been comparable to that observed with conventional open surgery. This technique is an intermediary method between orthopaedic treatment and conventional surgery. Exact indications must be established. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous osteosynthesis of lumbar and thoracolumbar spine fractures is an attractive therapeutic option. Our results are encouraging. Indications and limitations of this technique must be carefully identified.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanical characteristics of self-developed distraction reduction fixation system (DRFS) and to evaluate its clinical effect on thoracolumbar vertebrate fracture. METHODS: Twelve fresh porcine spines were prepared for the biomechanical test. The stiffness of each intact specimen were recorded on forward bending (20 degrees), backward bending (10 degrees), lateral bending (30 degrees) and axial rotation (20 degrees), and then specimens of fracture dislocation were made by cuneiform osteotomy of L3 vertebral body and excision of posterior facet joints. Finally, DRFS internal fixation was performed on each specimen. The stiffness of specimens in fracture dislocation and after DRFS fixation were measured during the same movements mentioned above, respectively. The clinical effect of DRFS on thoracolumbar vertebrate fracture in 31 patients (aged 17-46 years with an average of 32.1) from April 1998 to October 2002 was summarized. Fracture types were classified according to Denis classification: 2 patients suffered simple compressed fracture, 16 burst fracture, and 13 fracture dislocation, including 2 cases of T11, 11 cases of T12, 14 cases of L1 and 4 cases of L2. Frankel and X-ray examination were adopted to assess the results. RESULTS: The stiffness during forward bending, backward bending, lateral bending and axial rotation in the fracture-dislocation state was markedly lower than that of the corresponding movements of the intact porcine spines (P {\textless} 0.05). After DRFS, the stiffness during various movements increased to the level that significantly higher than that in the fracture-dislocation state (P {\textless} 0.05), and the stiffness during backward bending was of significant difference (P {\textless} 0.05), but without significant difference during the rest three movements (P {\textgreater} 0.05) when compared to that in intact spines. Regarding clinical observation, the operation time was 2.2-4.1 hours (2.7 hours on average) and blood loss was 250-600 mL (450 mL on average). The patients were followed up for 5-20 months (10.2 months on average). The healing time for fracture was 5-1 months (8 months on average). The mean anterior and posterior heights of the injured vertebrate recovered from 46.2{\%} +/- 7.5{\%} and 76.4{\%} +/- 2.4{\%} preoperatively to 89.8{\%} +/- 4.6{\%} and 94.1{\%} +/- 1.5{\%} postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.05).The median point height also raised from 60.8{\%} +/- 6.4{\%} to 90.7{\%} +/- 2.9{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). The Cobb's angle decreased from (26.3 +/- 5.9)degrees to (5.2 +/- 1.8)degrees (P {\textless} 0.05), and all the slipped vertebrates were well repositioned. Spine function was assessed by Frankel classification as follows: 2 of 5 Class A preoperatively improved to Class B postoperatively, and the other 3 remained unchanged; 4 of 6 from B to C, and the other 2 to D; 6 of 13 from C to D, and the other 7 to E; and 7 from D to E. CONCLUSION: DRFS is capable of providing sufficient stability, meeting the requirement of the spine physical activity without any obvious side effect. DRFS, as a handy, safe and effective technique in clinical practice, is featured by satisfying functions of distraction, reposition and fixation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of traumatic spinal dural tears is difficult to establish. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliable MR imaging findings suggesting dural tears in spinal burst fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed spine MR images of 21 patients with dural tears (study group) and 33 patients without dural tears (control group), all of whom had spinal burst fractures. The following MR imaging features were compared between the 2 groups: the interpedicular distance, the angle of the retropulsed segments, the ratio of the central canal diameter, the presence or absence of laminar fractures, the degree of laminar fractures, and the extent of epidural hemorrhage. RESULTS: The mean values of the grade of the laminar fracture, the interpedicular distance, the ratio of the central canal diameter, the angle of the retropulsed segment, and the extent of epidural hemorrhage in the study and control groups were as follows: 1.77 and 0.86 (P = .034), 28.7 and 26 mm (P = .02), 0.37 and 0.58 (P = .008), 112 degrees and 128 degrees (P = .05), and 2.37 and 1.4 (P = .11), respectively. The ratio of the central canal diameter was the most reliable factor suggesting dural tears compared with other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Dural tears are likely when there are MR imaging findings of laminar fracture of more than grade 1, the interpedicular distance is {\textgreater}28 mm, the central canal ratio is {\textless}0.46, and the acute angle of the retropulsed segment is {\textless}135 degrees .},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness, reliability and donor site morbidity of  pectoral nerve transfers in the treatment of brachial plexus lesions. METHODS: This retrospective study included 6 patients with 7 pectoral nerve transfers. The follow-up examination comprised measurement of the ranges of motion (AO neutral-0 method), functional muscle testing (British Medical Research Council), and photo- and videographic documentation. RESULTS: Three patients achieved excellent results (M5, M4), in 3 cases good muscle function was achieved (M3) and 1 patient, who had a short follow-up period, revealed M2 motor function. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the treatment of patients with conditions far from ideal. All patients sustained extensive brachial plexus lesions and most had severe associated injuries of the upper limb, which limited the availability of sufficient donor nerves. Despite these facts, 6 cases had excellent or good results and 1 showed continuing improvement of muscle function. These good results and the excellent results documented in literature demonstrate the high dependability and efficiency of the pectoral nerves as donors in the treatment of brachial plexus lesions. Furthermore, it was shown that free functioning muscle transplants can be sufficiently reinnervated by pectoral nerves. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.},

abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Various classification systems have been proposed for fractures of the distal radius, but the reliability of these classifications is seldom addressed. For a fracture classification to be useful, it must provide prognostic significance, interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility. The aim here was to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver agreement of distal radius fracture classifications. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a validation study on interobserver and intraobserver reliability. It was developed in the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina. METHOD: X-rays from 98 cases of displaced distal radius fracture were evaluated by five observers: one third-year orthopedic resident (R3), one sixth-year undergraduate medical student (UG6), one radiologist physician (XRP), one orthopedic trauma specialist (OT) and one orthopedic hand surgery specialist (OHS). The radiographs were classified on three different occasions (times T1, T2 and T3) using the Universal (Cooney), Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF), Frykman and Fernandez classifications. The kappa coefficient (kappa) was applied to assess the degree of agreement. RESULTS: Among the three occasions, the highest mean intraobserver k was observed in the Universal classification (0.61), followed by Fernandez (0.59), Frykman (0.55) and AO/ASIF (0.49). The interobserver agreement was unsatisfactory in all classifications. The Fernandez classification showed the best agreement (0.44) and the worst was the Frykman classification (0.26). CONCLUSION: The low agreement levels observed in this study suggest that there is still no classification method with high reproducibility.},

abstract = {Endogenous mediators within the inflammatory milieu play a critical role in directing the scope, duration, and resolution of inflammation. High-molecular-weight extracellular matrix hyaluronan (HA) helps to maintain homeostasis. During inflammation, hyaluronan is broken down into fragments that induce chemokines and cytokines, thereby augmenting the inflammatory response. Tissue-derived adenosine, released during inflammation, inhibits inflammation via the anti-inflammatory A2 adenosine receptor (A2aR). We demonstrate that adenosine modulates HA-induced gene expression via the A2aR. A2aR stimulation inhibits HA fragment-induced pro-fibrotic genes TNF-alpha, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, and MIP-1alpha while simultaneously synergizing with hyaluronan fragments to up-regulate the TH1 cytokine IL-12. Interestingly, A2aR stimulation mediates these affects via the novel cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor EPAC. In addition, A2aR-null mice are more susceptible to bleomycin-induced lung injury, consistent with a role for endogenous adenosine in inhibiting the inflammation that may lead to fibrosis. Indeed, the bleomycin treated A2aR-null mice demonstrate increased lung inflammation, HA accumulation, and histologic damage. Overall, our data elucidate the opposing roles of tissue-derived HA fragments and adenosine in regulating noninfectious lung inflammation and support the pursuit of A2aR agonists as a means of pharmacologically inhibiting inflammation that may lead to fibrosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We recently reported the association of the Sp1 site polymorphism of the COL1A1 gene with lumbar disk disease (LDD). In the present study we searched for a different polymorphism of the COL1A1 gene (which is usually not in linkage disequilibrium with the Sp1 site) in subjects with LDD. DESIGN: Blood was collected from 24 Greek army recruits, aged 29+/-7.6 years, with LDD, and 66 healthy men, aged 26+/-4.38 years, matched for body mass index (BMI) and age, with normal BMD and with no history of trauma or fractures, who served as controls. DNA was extracted and the COL1A1 gene was sequenced. Of the control subjects, 12 were army recruits and 54 were selected from the general population. RESULTS: The four base-pair insertion polymorphism in the COL1A1 gene analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA produces two different fragments (alleles A1 and A2): 14 patients (58.3{\%}) were homozygous for A2A2, versus 35 controls (53{\%}), while 3 patients (12.5{\%}) were A1A1, and 8 of the control subjects (12{\%}) had this genotype. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of the two alleles of this polymorphism between patients with LDD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A four base-pair insertion polymorphism of the COL1A1 gene is not associated with the presence of LDD in young males, unlike the Sp1 site polymorphism of the same gene. These data reinforce the association between LDD and the functional polymorphisms of the Sp1 site by showing that other polymorphic sites of the of the COL1A1 gene in the same population of patients are not linked to the disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biomechanical action of lateral malleolar's anatomical hook-plate in treating Weber A-type ankle fracture. METHODS: Forty-eight cadaveric specimens of adult's inferior extremities from June 2005 to October 2006 were observed, consisting of 26 males and 22 females and aged 18-55 years. The external malleolus of the specimens were transected by using a wire saw at the ankle joint level, and then were divided into 4 groups randomly (groups A, B, C and D). Four distinct internal fixation instruments were used: lateral malleolar's anatomical hook-plate in group A, general screws in group B, 1/3 tubular plate in group C and standard tension band in group D. Each group was further divided into 2 subgroups, A1-D1 and A2-D2. A1-D1 groups underwent anti-pressure and A2-D2 groups underwent anti-torsion biomechanically comparative analysis. RESULTS: The peak values of anti-pressure experiments in groups A1-D1 were (799.83 +/- 105.47), (699.17 +/- 63.81), (598.83 +/- 123.14) and (453.00 +/- 111.67) N respectively, group A1 was significantly higher than groups B1, C1 and D1 (P {\textless} 0.01); meanwhile, the peak values of anti-torsion experiments in groups A2-D2 were (37.17 +/- 1.81), (30.33 +/- 2.22), (20.50 +/- 2.92), (24.83 +/- 3.47) Nm respectively, group A2 was significantly higher than groups B2, C2 and D2 (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: The lateral malleolar's anatomical hook-plate represents a definite biomechanical superiority, when compared with other 3 internal fixation instruments in treating fracture of external malleolus.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether the degree of radiographically observed pretreatment radius deformity of low-energy Colles' type distal radius fractures resulting from falls is associated with the degree of bone fragility as measured by bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine in Japanese women above 50 years of age. METHODS: The study subjects were 125 consecutive Japanese women older than 50 years of age with Colles' type (AO type A and C) dorsally angulated distal radius fractures caused by falls. Fractures due to high-energy injuries such as traffic accidents were excluded. Radius deformity was assessed on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs by measuring ulnar variance, radial inclination, and dorsal angulation at initial examination before manual repositioning of the bone. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was also measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the follow-up visit. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the respective values of ulnar variance, radial inclination, and dorsal angulation between patients with BMD values {\textless} 70{\%} of the mean value of young adults and those with BMD values {\textgreater} or = 70{\%}. Radius deformity was significantly greater for all parameters in the former group relative to the latter. The respective values of increased ulnar variance, decreased radial inclination, and increased dorsal angulation significantly correlated with lower BMD. Stepwise regression analysis of data of all subjects identified that ulnar variance was significantly associated with dorsal angulation, BMD, and radial inclination. The addition of body height, body weight, body mass index, and urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides (bone resorption marker) to the regression analysis of data of a subset of patients confirmed that ulnar variance was significantly associated with BMD and radial inclination. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between BMD of the lumbar spine and radiographic radius deformity seen in low-energy Colles' type distal radius fractures resulting from falls in Japanese women above 50 years of age.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Spinal injuries resulting from entering into water usually occur in the cervical region, with few reported in the thoracolumbar region. Although the mechanism of cervical spine injury caused by diving is known, less is known regarding the mechanism of upper lumbar spine injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects were five patients (mean age, 32.8 years), inexperienced in diving from heights, who were referred for burst fractures (Denis type B) at L1 caused while jumping into a river from a 12-m-high bridge between 2004 and 2005. Three patients were treated surgically and two were treated conservatively. Their clinical outcomes were reviewed and the mechanism of upper lumbar spine injury was discussed. RESULTS: No patient experienced neurological deficit or low back pain after treatment, and all returned to their previous activities within 1 year. Impact with the surface of the river with back and hip flexed may be a major cause of upper lumbar spine injury. CONCLUSIONS: To minimize the incidence of upper lumbar burst fracture during recreational high jumping into water, it is important that jumpers, especially inexperienced jumpers, should be instructed to jump with their backs and hips straight.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of plain radiography in detecting thoracolumbar burst fractures when CT scans were used as the gold standard, and to assess the impact of disagreement of the results between plain radiographs and CT scans on treatment plan. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There have been few studies comparing the value of plain radiography with that of CT scans in the diagnosis and management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Radiographs of 73 patients with a compression or burst fracture were reviewed independently by 3 residents and 3 spine surgeons. The results of CT scans were used as the gold standard to determine the accuracy of plain radiography for the diagnosis. More quantitative results of 57 patients with a burst fracture based on plain radiographs alone were compared with those after addition of CT scans. The disagreement between the results was analyzed, and the impact of disagreement on treatment plan was defined as the changes of load sharing score between {\textless}or=6 and {\textgreater}or=7. RESULTS: The accuracy of plain radiography improved with the experience of observers. The results on the load sharing score agreed between plain radiographs alone and radiographs with CT scans only for 56{\%}, indicating moderate agreement. The impact of disagreement on treatment plan was significant (P {\textless} 0.05). This disagreement was most contributed by the underestimation for vertebral body comminution based on plain radiographs. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of plain radiography is acceptable in the qualitative sense, and would improve with the experience of observers. However, plain radiography alone would not be adequate when used for more quantitatively assessing the fractures. Addition of CT scanning is necessary for treatment planning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The null hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the compression forces generated with a novel compressible intramedullary nail are not different from compression plating techniques. METHODS: A custom sensor was used to measure the compressive force at a transverse midshaft humeral sawbone osteotomy (OTA 12-A3.2) in four groups. The groups included: standard compression plating using a limited contact dynamic compression plate (LCDC) with eccentric screw placement (ED-LCDC), compression plating using an LCDC plate with an articulated tensioner and eccentric compression screw (AT-LCDC), locked humeral nail compressed using the manufacturer's long stainless steel screwdriver (T2-IMN), and locked humeral nail compressed using a short stainless steel AO screwdriver (SF-IMN). From continuous measurements recorded during osteotomy compression, the maximum force (CMax) and force at 60 seconds after the peak measurement (CMax +60) were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean CMax was 2043 N for SF-IMN, 1109 N for AT-LCDC, 799 N for T2-IMN, and 365 N for ED-LCDC. Mean CMax +60 was 1648 N for SF-IMN, 944 N for AT-LCDC, 650 N for T2-IMN, and 319 N for ED-LCDC. The difference in both CMax and CMax +60 was statistically significant between all groups (p {\textless} 0.002). CONCLUSION: A new humeral nail can generate higher compression than plating using eccentric drill holes or the articulated tensioner when used with a short stainless steel screwdriver shaft. Clinical studies are needed to analyze whether this compression could improve the union rate of humeral fractures and nonunions beyond those of standard nails.},

abstract = {The nonsurgical treatment of thoracolumbar (TLB) and lumbar burst (LB) fractures  remains to be of interest, though it is not costly and avoids surgical risks. However, a subset of distinct burst fracture patterns tend to go with a suboptimal radiographic and clinical long-term outcome. Detailed fracture pattern and treatment-related results in terms of validated outcome measures are still lacking. In addition, there are controversial data on the impact of local posttraumatic kyphosis that is associated, in particular, with nonsurgical treatment. The assessment of global spinal balance following burst fractures has not been assesed, yet. Therefore, the current study intended to investigate the radiographical and clinical long-term outcome in neurologically intact patients with special focus on the impact of regional posttraumatic kyphosis, adjacent-level compensatoric mechanisms, and global spine balance on the clinical outcome. For the purpose of a homogenous sample, strong in- and exclusion criteria were applied that resulted in a final study sample of 21 patients with a mean follow-up of 9.5 years. Overall, clinical outcome evaluated by validated measures was diminished, with 62{\%} showing a good or excellent outcome and 38{\%} a moderate or poor outcome in terms of the Greenough Low Back Outcome Scale. Notably, vertebral comminution in terms of the load-sharing classification, posttraumatic kyphosis, and an overall decreased lumbopelvic lordosis showed a significant effect on clinical outcome. A global and segmental curve analysis of the spine T9 to S1 revealed significant alterations as compared to normals. But, the interdependence of spinopelvic parameters was not disrupted. The patients' spinal adaptability to compensate for the posttraumatic kyphotic deformity varied in the ranges dictated by pelvic geometry, in particular the pelvic incidence. The study substantiates the concept that surgical reconstruction and maintenance of a physiologically shaped spinal curve might be the appropriate treatment in the more severely crushed TLB and LB fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively assessed the results of percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) by clinical and radiological methods. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of KP as a treatment for osteoporotic burst fractures. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Many surgeons are concerned about the possibility of neurological complications after percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic burst fractures, secondary to intra-canal cement leakage. METHODS: We performed KP as a treatment for osteoporotic burst fractures. We studied 12 patients/13 vertebrae. The two control groups consisted of patients who only underwent conservative treatment and those who underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion. We measured each preoperative/postoperative vertebral kyphotic deformity angle (KDA) using simple lateral spine images and checked for leakage of cement, as well. The preoperative/postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for back pain, degree of daily activity, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean improvement in KDA after KP was 9.7+/-2.2 degrees . The mean preoperative and postoperative VAS scores for back pain were 8.3+/-0.4 and 3.1+/-0.17, respectively. Regarding the control group, the mean postoperative VAS score for the conservative group and the posterior surgery group decreased by 4.5+/-0.17 and 3.2+/-0.19, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the KP and posterior surgery groups (p=0.125). However, there was a statistically significant difference between the KP and conservative treatment groups (p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: KP is safe and useful for treating osteoporotic burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcome of the percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture with neurological intact. METHODS: Sixty patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit underwent either percutaneous (n = 30) or traditional open pedicle screw fixation (n = 30). Radiographs obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, 4 months and 2 years after surgery were used to access the restoration of spinal anatomy. Also, operation time, blood loss, blood drainage, hospital stay and soft tissue dissection were evaluated. The level of pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), function by the Oswestry questionnaire. RESULTS: The average followed up was 2 years. There were no significant differences between both groups concerning age, sex, cause of injury and the presence of other severe injuries. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in blood loss, blood drainage, hospital stay and soft tissue dissection (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas no significant differences in operation time (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The vertebral height, the kyphosis angle, and the occupation of spinal canal after surgery and at follow-up were not significantly (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The pain systems and functions were similar in both groups at final follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05), however, less pain was found in the percutaneous group than that in the open group at the first 3 months after surgery (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fracture has the advantage of less trauma, quickly recovery and better esthetic outcome, however, it has the same results with the traditional open produce after 2 years of surgery.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-seccional analysis. OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical usefulness of vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) in detecting cervical medullar involvement related to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VEMP is generated by acoustic or galvanic stimuli, passing through the vestibulo-spinal motor tract, the spinal nerves and recorded by means of surface electrodes on the sternocleidomastoid muscle. HAM/TSP is a progressive inflammatory myelopathy with predominant lesions at the thoracic spinal cord level, although the cervical spine can be affected. VEMP may be of value to investigate cervical myelopathy. METHODS: Seventy-two individuals were evaluated of whom 30 HTLV-1 were seronegative and 42 HTLV-1 seropositive (22 asymptomatic, 10 with complaints of walking difficulty without definite HAM/TSP and 10 with definite HAM/TSP). VEMP was recorded using monaural delivered short tone burst (linear rise-fall 1 millisecond, plateau 2 milliseconds, 1 KHz) 118 dB NA, stimulation rate of 5 Hz, analysis time of 60 milliseconds, 200 stimuli, band pass filtered between 10 and 1.500 Hz. RESULTS: VEMP was normal in the seronegative group (30 controls). In the seropositive, abnormal VEMP was seen in 11 of 22 (50{\%}) of the HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers, in 7 of 10 (70{\%}) of those with complaints of walking difficulty and in 8 of 10 (80{\%}) of the HAM/TSP patients. In this last group, the pattern of response was different. No VEMP response was more frequent when compared with the HTLV-1 asymptomatic group (2-tailed P-value = 0.001). CONCLUSION: VEMP may possibly be useful to identify patients with cervical myelopathy and to distinguish variable degrees of functional damage. Minor injury would be related to latency prolongation and major injury to no potential-evoked response.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanical comparison of fixation constructs in an experimental fracture model. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative postoperative stability of anterior graft and plating with that of posterior or combined fixation constructs in an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several treatment modalities have been proposed for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, but the optimal technique is unclear. Previous cadaveric biomechanical studies in unstable burst fracture models have not considered the commonly used posterior (interpedicular) and anterior (plate) constructs. METHODS: Nine human spine segments (T11-L3) were potted in epoxy and scanned using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Intact specimens had baseline flexibility testing. Unstable L1 burst fractures as verified by computed tomography were created using an impulse load and posterior surgical osteoligamentous destabilization (ie, transection of the lamina, interspinous ligaments, facet capsules, and ligamentum flavum). Specimens were instrumented posteriorly with pedicle screws and rods and tested to 6 Nm in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and torsion. Corpectomy and strut grafting were then performed, and testing was repeated in varying order with posterior fixation, anterior plating and circumferential fixation. Range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone was calculated for each test and fixation groups were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS: All specimens had AO B1.2 (unstable burst) fractures. Mean ROM for posterior-only constructs was significantly less than that of the intact in lateral bending, flexion, and extension (P{\textless}0.001). Anterior-only constructs after corpectomy and strut grafting generally resulted in a smaller ROM versus intact in flexion (NS: P=0.1) and lateral bending (P{\textless}0.001). In contrast, all anterior-only and posterior constructs had greater ROM than intact in torsion (all at P{\textless}0.05). Circumferential fixation resulted in statistically smaller ROM compared with all other constructs (P{\textless} or =0.04), and reached that of the intact specimen in torsion. Increased ROM was correlated with greater fracture comminution for posterior-only fixation (P{\textless}0.05), and was weakly correlated with lower dual energy x-ray absorptiometry score (R=0.3) for anterior-only fixation. CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential instrumentation provided the most rigid fixation, followed by posterior fixation with anterior strut grafting, posterior fixation alone, and by anterior fixation with strut grafting. These results were dependent on bone quality and the comminution severity of the fracture. These results should aid surgical decision making in addition to other factors in the overall clinical situation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Vertebral body fractures due to minor trauma, which commonly occur in the elderly, are a frequently encountered clinical problem. We utilized MRI in patients with acute back pain following minor injury to ensure the earliest possible diagnosis. Lumbar discs adjacent to fractured vertebral bodies were evaluated, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to elucidate how often these discs were injured and how the injured discs were depicted by MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images of 74 discs from 37 elderly patients ({\textgreater}65-year-old) with a single level vertebral fracture (fracture group). Patients with multiple-level fractures, burst fractures and/or major trauma, such as that resulting from a traffic accident, were excluded from this study. We also reviewed MR images of 190 discs from 27 elderly patients diagnosed with lumbar stenosis, who had no previous history of vertebral body fractures (stenosis group). RESULTS: In the fracture group, 23{\%} (17/74) of T1-weighted images exhibited a high-intensity area in the disc, whereas only 3{\%} (5/190) exhibited a high-intensity area in the stenosis group. In some cases, in the T2-weighted images we also found a high-intensity zone in discs that showed low- or iso-intensity. This phenomenon was more frequently observed in the fracture group (47{\%}: 35/74) than in the stenosis group. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that, in elderly patients, intervertebral discs adjacent to vertebral fractures resulting from minor trauma are often injured. Because hemorrhage is the most likely cause of a high-intensity T1-weighted image, the results indicate that hemorrhage can be induced in a disc adjacent to a vertebral body fractured by even minor trauma.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate a group of 11 patients with L5 burst fractures  treated by L4-S1 posterior instrumented spinal fusion without reconstruction of the anterior column. MATERIAL: The group included seven men and four women aged between 14 and 66 years (average, 37.5 years), followed for 12 to 36 months (average, 18 months). Ten patients were treated by posterior instrumented spinal fusion at the L4-S1 level, and one with an associated injury to L3 underwent L2-L4-S1 posterior instrumented spinal fusion. The spinal column was inspected in eight patients in whom neurological symptoms or significant stenosis were present. METHODS: On admission, the evaluation of post-traumatic radiographs included measurements of the angle between the L4 lower and the S1 upper end-plates, the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5 and height of the anterior and posterior rims of the L5 vertebral body. CT scans were assessed for a relative narrowing of the spinal canal. The patient's neurological status was also evaluated. At 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of follow-up, radiographs, neurological findings and subjective complaints were assessed. RESULTS: On comparison of pre-operative values with those 3 months after surgery, the differences were on average 3.6 degrees for L4-S1 lordosis, 2.5 degrees for the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5, and 1 mm for the height of the anterior rim; there was no difference in posterior rim height. Eight patients had the same values at the latest as at 3- month follow-up. Three patients with broken screws showed the loss of L4-S1 lordosis by 4 to 13 degrees (average, 9 degrees). Neither the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5, nor vertebral body height were changed. The narrowing of the spinal canal by vertebral body fragments ranged from 0 to 60 {\%} (average, 35 {\%}) of canal space. On admission, neurological findings were normal in two patients and involved nerve root syndrome in five patients. In four patients it was not possible to assess their neurological status. At he latest follow-up, ten patients were free from peripheral neurological lesions, one still had lumbar radicular syndrome, two patients reported mild or moderate lumbosacral pain and seven patients were without complaints. Subjective complaints could not be assessed in two patients because of their mental state. An early post-operative complication included wound dehiscence in one patient (9 {\%}) and, in three patients, broken screws in S1 were recorded as late complications. DISCUSSION: Only a few references referring to a relatively low number of patients with L burst fractures treated by surgery were found in the literature. Most of the authors report limitations of reduction and good clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The posterior instrumented spinal fusion of L5 alone is sufficient for the treatment of most L5 burst fractures. Early removal of the fixator is indicated in active patients. Often good clinical outcomes are in contradiction with radiological findings. The possibilities of spinal canal decompression by ligamentotaxis at this level of injury are limited. When significant spinal stenosis is present, laminectomy or hemilaminectomy is necessary to achieve decompression of the spinal canal.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess whether canal compromise determines neurological deficit in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: 105 patients aged 17 to 60 (mean, 34) years who had burst fractures in the thoracolumbar (n=82) and lumbar (n=23) regions were included. Fractures were classified according to the Denis classification. The extent of spinal canal compromise was assessed by computed tomography, and the neurological status according to the modified Frankel grading for traumatic paraplegia. RESULTS: 19 (18{\%}) of the patients had no neurological deficit. Of the remaining 86 (82{\%}) with a deficit, 26 had complete paraplegia. The correlation between the type of the burst fracture and the severity of neurological deficit was not significant (Chi squared=10.57, p=0.835). The mean extent of spinal canal compromise in patients with deficits was 50{\%}, whereas in patients with no deficit it was 36{\%}. The difference between the extent of canal compromise and the severity of neurological deficit at the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine was not significant (p=0.08). Further subanalysis revealed a significant correlation at T11 and T12 (p=0.007) but not at the L1 (p=0.42) level. CONCLUSION: When studying neurological deficit, T11 and T12 injuries should be analysed separately from L1 injuries.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Increased structural stability is considered sufficient justification for higher-risk surgical procedures, such as circumferential fixation after severe spinal destabilization. However, there is little biomechanical evidence to support such claims, particularly after traumatic lumbar burst fracture. The authors sought out to compare the biomechanical performance of the following 3 fixation strategies for spinal reconstruction after decompression for an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture: 1) short-segment anterolateral fixation; 2) circumferential fixation; and 3) extended anterolateral fixation. METHODS: Thoracolumbar spines (T10-L4) from 7 donors (mean age at death 64+/-6 years; 1 female and 6 males) were tested in pure moment loading in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Thoracolumbar burst fractures were surgically induced at L-1, and testing was repeated sequentially for each of the following fixation techniques: short-segment anterolateral, circumferential, and extended anterolateral. Primary and coupled 3D motions were measured across the instrumented site (T12-L2) and compared across treatment groups. RESULTS: Circumferential and extended anterolateral fixations were statistically equivalent for primary and off-axis range-of-motions in all loading directions, and short-segment anterolateral fixation offered significantly less rigidity than the other 2 methods. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study strongly suggest that extended anterolateral fixation is biomechanically comparable to circumferential fusion in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with posterior column and posterior ligamentous injury. In cases in which an anterior procedure may be favored for load sharing or canal decompression, extension of the anterior instrumentation and fusion one level above and below the unstable segment can result in near equivalent stability to a 2-stage circumferential procedure.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of minimal invasive surgery for acute lumbar fractures by means of balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate plus segmental short posterior instrumented fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the surgical treatment of lumbar fractures with short pedicle screw instrumentation, the failure to support the anterior spinal column often results in loss of correction. Transpedicular augmentation techniques with bone and bone substitutes have been attempted whereas kyphoplasty has been increasingly used to augment fractured vertebral body. METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with an average age of 64 +/- 15 years, who sustained lumbar (L1-L4) burst and severe compression fracture were included in this prospective study. On admission, 2 (11{\%}) of 18 patients had incomplete neurologic impairment. All patients underwent bilateral balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate bone cement to reduce segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height and segmental pedicle screw instrumentation and fusion. Gardner kyphosis angle, anterior (AVBHr) and posterior vertebral body height ratio (PVBHr), and spinal canal encroachment (SCE) were calculated before to after surgery. VAS and SF-36 were used to evaluate functional outcome. RESULTS: All patients were operated within 24 hours after admission and were followed for an average 22 months (17-28 months) after index surgery. Operating time and blood loss averaged 45 minutes and 70 mL, respectively. VAS and SF-36 (role physical and bodily pain domains) were significantly improved after surgery. Both patients with incomplete neurologic lesions recovered, whereas no neurologic deterioration was observed in any case. Segmental kyphosis improved from an average preoperative kyphosis of 16 to 2 degrees after surgery (P {\textless} 0.000). AVBHr improved from an average before surgery 0.57 to 0.87 (P {\textless} 0.000) after surgery, whereas PVBHr improved from 0.93 before surgery to 0.98 (P {\textless} 0.05) after surgery. SCE was reduced from an average 25{\%} before surgery to 19{\%} (P {\textless} 0.07) after surgery. Bone cement leakage was observed anteriorly to the fractured vertebral body or to the adjacent superior disc in 4 patients without clinical sequelae, whereas 3 pedicle screws were malpositioned medially to the pedicle in 3 patients without neurologic impairment or associated complaints. Posterolateral radiologic fusion was achieved within 6 to 8 months after index operation. There was no instrumentation failure or loss of sagittal curve and vertebral height correction. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement combined with posterior segmental short minimal invasive fixation for fresh burst and severe compression lumbar fractures provided excellent immediate reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis with simultaneous reduction of spinal canal encroachment and restoration of vertebral body height in the fracture level.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Recurrent kyphosis has been commonly seen after posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation for a thoracolumbar fracture, but studies on this issue are relatively scarce, and the clinical significance of recurrent deformity is uncertain. No study has addressed the associations between the reduction of a burst fracture vertebra and the final recurrent kyphosis after implant removal. The aim of this study was to investigate the recurrent kyphosis after short-segment pedicle screw fixation in thoracolumbar burst fractures and to evaluate the effect of the degree of a vertebral reduction on the recurrent kyphotic deformity after implant removal. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients who had undergone posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12-L2) were investigated retrospectively. The minimum follow-up period was 2 years (mean 2.7 years). Pain status was evaluated using the Denis pain scale. Changes in the anterior vertebral height ratio, vertebral wedge angle, upper intervertebral angle, lower intervertebral angle, Cobb angle, regional angle, and sagittal index were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, before implant removal, and at final follow-up. The correlation between the reduction of a fractured vertebra and the recurrent kyphotic deformity was also analyzed. RESULTS: After the initial surgical correction, the reduced vertebral body (VB) height (anterior vertebral height ratio and vertebral wedge angle) remained stable until final follow-up, whereas the intervertebral disc space (the upper and lower intervertebral angles) collapsed, resulting in a progressive kyphotic deformity (Cobb angle, regional angle, and sagittal index). No significant correlation was found between the final kyphosis and pain scale, but the 8 patients with a sagittal index {\textgreater} 15 degrees showed a higher incidence of moderate to severe pain (P3-5 on the Denis pain scale) compared with the remaining 19 patients with a sagittal index {\textless} 15 degrees . Significant positive correlation was found between recurrent kyphosis and vertebral wedge angle (r = 0.850, p {\textless} 0.001) and the reduced vertebral height (r = -0.727, p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Given that the correction loss occurs primarily through disc space collapse, the amount of the final kyphotic deformity was predictable by the degree of the fractured vertebral reduction as seen on the lateral x-ray study. Surgeons who perform posterior reduction and fixation procedures should pay more attention to reducing the fractured vertebral wedge angle to its intact condition, rather than the segmental angular parameters. If the wedge angle of the fractured VB is unacceptable after reduction, additional reconstruction of the anterior column may be necessary.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of the treatment of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures by transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement and posterior instrumented fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures, the major problem after posterior correction and transpedicular instrumentation is failure to support the anterior spinal column, leading to the loss of correction and instrumentation failure. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with an average age of 48 years, who sustained thoracolumbar A3-type burst fracture with or without neurologic deficit were included in this prospective study. Twenty-one of 23 patients had single fractures and 2 had each one additional A1 compression contiguous fracture. On admission 5 (26{\%}) of 23 patients had neurologic lesion (5 incomplete, 1 complete). Bilateral transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty was performed with quick hardening calcium phosphate cement to reduce segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height and supplementary pedicle-screw instrumentation [long including 4 vertebrae for T9-L1 fractures and short (3 vertebrae) for L2-L4 fractures]. Gardner kyphosis angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height ratio, and spinal canal encroachment were calculated before to after surgery. RESULTS: All 23 patients were operated within 2 days after admission and were followed for at least 24 months after index surgery. Operating time and blood loss averaged 70 minutes and 250 cc, respectively. The 5 patients with incomplete neurologic lesions improved by at least 1 American Spine Injury Association grade, whereas no neurologic deterioration was observed in any case. Overall sagittal alignment was improved from an average preoperative 16 degrees to 1 degrees kyphosis at final follow-up observation. The anterior vertebral body height ratio improved from 0.6 before surgery to 0.9 (P {\textless} 0.001) after surgery, whereas posterior vertebral body height was improved from 0.95 to 1 (P {\textless} 0.01). Spinal canal encroachment was reduced from an average 32{\%} before surgery to 20{\%} after surgery. No differences in preoperative values and postoperative changes in radiographic parameters between short and long group were shown. Cement leakage was observed in 4 cases: 3 anterior to vertebral body and 1 into the disc without sequela. In the last computed tomography evaluation, there was shown a continuity between calcium phosphate and cancellous vertebral body bone. Posterolateral radiological fusion was achieved within 6 to 8 months after index operation. There was no instrumentation failure or measurable loss of sagittal curve and vertebral height correction in any group of patients. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement secured with posterior long and short fixation in the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine, respectively, provided excellent immediate reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis and significant spinal canal clearance and restored vertebral body height in the fracture level in an equal amount both in the short and the long instrumentation.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with posterior short-segment  pedicle fixation usually provides excellent initial correction of kyphotic deformity, but a significant amount of correction can be lost afterwards. This study evaluates the clinical relevance of the short-segment pedicle fixation supplemented by laminar hooks (2HS-1SH) construct in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-five patients with a single-level thoracolumbar burst fracture were assessed in this retrospective study. All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year (mean 2.9 [standard deviation {\{}SD{\}}] 1.5 y). Preoperative vertebral height loss and local kyphosis were 35{\%} (SD 14{\%}) and 19 degrees (SD 9 degrees ), respectively. Mean corrections of vertebral height and kyphosis were 10{\%} (SD 16{\%}) and 12 degrees (SD 9 degrees ), respectively. Mean loss of correction at last follow-up was 2{\%} (SD 6{\%}) and 4 degrees (SD 3 degrees ) for vertebral height and kyphosis, respectively. Loss of correction was significant for local kyphosis (p 0.001) but not for vertebral height (p = 0.20). Despite the significant loss of correction for local kyphosis, it remained improved at latest follow-up when compared with the preoperative value (p 0.001). For patients with more than 2 years of follow-up, most of the loss of correction in local kyphosis occurred during the first postoperative year. There was no evidence of instrumentation failure or pseudarthrosis in any patient. The 2HS-1SH construct provides significant correction of vertebral body height and local kyphosis. It also preserves the initial correction and minimizes the risk of instrumentation failure.},

However, the use of both approaches on a trauma patient may increase morbidity. Stabilization of three columns through only one approach can provide an effective outcome. We treated eight patients with burst fracture involving the thoracic or lumbar vertebrae by the application of anterior and posterior stabilization instruments through only the posterior approach. The desired stabilization was obtained in all patients. The advantages are the absence of the risks of the anterior approach, facilitation of the placement of anterior and posterior stabilization devices through only one approach, preserving the unity of the anterior longitudinal ligament, the effect of the anterior corpus in preventing displacement of the cage, application of compression on the pedicle screw system to both decrease the kyphosis angulation due to collapse of vertebra and to help the stabilization of the cage, repair of the dural tears at the posterior side, prevention of cage displacement by distraction and thus leaning on the endplates, and ease of performance by a neurosurgeon alone.},

abstract = {To assess the efficacy and feasibility of vertebroplasty and posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of traumatic lumbar burst fractures. Short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is a well described technique to reduce and stabilize thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. It is relatively a easy procedure but can only indirectly reduce a fractured vertebral body, and the means of augmenting the anterior column are limited. Hardware failure and a loss of reduction are recognized complications caused by insufficient anterior column support. Patients with traumatic lumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were included. After a short segment posterior reduction and fixation, bilateral transpedicular reduction of the endplate was performed using a balloon, and polymethyl methacrylate cement was injected. Pre-operative and post-operative central and anterior heights were assessed with radiographs and MRI. Sixteen patients underwent this procedure, and a substantial reduction of the endplates could be achieved with the technique. All patients recovered uneventfully, and the neurologic examination revealed no deficits. The post-operative radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone defect without unwarranted bone displacement. The central and anterior height of the vertebral body could be restored to 72 and 82{\%} of the estimated intact height, respectively. Complications were cement leakage in three cases without clinical implications and one superficial wound infection. Posterior short-segment pedicle fixation in conjunction with balloon vertebroplasty seems to be a feasible option in the management of lumbar burst fractures, thereby addressing all the three columns through a single approach. Although cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences or neurological deficit.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three fingers from 21 patients were consecutively investigated. Two musculoskeletal radiologists retrospectively compared all sequences to assess the visibility of normal and abnormal A2 pulleys and the presence of motion or ghost artefacts. RESULTS: Normal and abnormal A2 pulleys were visible in 94{\%} (59/63) and 95{\%} (60/63) on T1WI sequences, in 63{\%} (40/63) and 60{\%} (38/63) on FS T2WI sequences, and in 87{\%} (55/63) and 73{\%} (46/63) on Gd FS T1WI sequences when read by the first and second observer, respectively. Motion and ghost artefacts were higher on FS T2WI sequences. Seven among eight abnormal A2 pulleys were detected, and were best depicted with Gd FS T1WI sequences in 71{\%} (5/7) and 86{\%} (6/7) by the first and the second observer, respectively. CONCLUSION: In 3-T MRI, the comparison between transverse T1WI, FS T2WI, and Gd FS T1WI sequences shows that transverse T1WI allows excellent depiction of the A2 pulley, that FS T2WI suffers from a higher rate of motion and ghost artefacts, and transverse Gd FS T1WI is the best sequence for the depiction of abnormal A2 pulley.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate by MRI whether a vertebral fracture during childhood is a risk factor for degeneration of adjacent discs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies infer that trauma is a major cause of disc degeneration. Only 1 study has by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluated disc degeneration in children with a former thoracic or lumbar vertebral fracture. That study reported a 50{\%} prevalence of degenerative disc changes 4 years after the fracture. However, due to the sparse literature, it is still unclear whether a vertebral fracture in childhood represents a risk factor for disc degeneration in a long-term perspective. METHOD: Nine boys and 11 girls with a mean age of 12 years (range, 7-16 years) when sustaining a lumbar or thoracic vertebral fracture without neurologic deficits were examined at a mean of 40 years (range, 33-53 years) after the injury. Eighteen of the subjects had 1-column compression fractures, and 2 had Denis Type B burst fractures. All were mobilized without brace or surgery directly after being injured. A favorable long-term clinical and plain radiographic outcome has previously been reported for this cohort. In the present study, the intervertebral discs were evaluated with MRI by applying the Oner classification scheme. Degenerative disc changes were defined as loss of signal intensity on T2-weighted images with or without disc height reduction. RESULTS: Degenerative changes were not more prevalent in discs adjacent to the previously fractured vertebrae than in discs at a distance from those segments. However, there were more Schmorl's nodes at the disc levels adjacent to the earlier fractures. CONCLUSION: Stable vertebral fractures in childhood with no neurologic deficits at injury do not render more degenerative changes than can be expected according to age, but they are associated with more Schmorl's nodes at adjacent disc levels.},

METHODS: Fifteen upper limbs specimen from fresh adult corpse were made shoulder joint-bone ligament specimen and divided in 5 groups (n=3). The load-shift curve of the following specimen was measured respectively at the shoulder joint in abductive angles of 0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90 degrees, influenced by 50 N posterior-anterior load to evaluate anterior stability of shoulder joint. According to different selective-cutting test, 5 groups were divided subgroups: group A (A1-A4), respectively normal group, superior GHL (SGHL) injury group; SGHL/middle GHL (MGHL) injury group and SGHL/MGHL/inferior GHL (IGHL) injury group; group B (B1-B3), respectively normal group, MGHL injury group, MGHL/IGHL injury group; group C (C1-C2), respectively normal group, IGHL-anterior band (IGHL-AB) injury group; group D D1-D2), respectively normal group, IGHL-posterior band (IGHL-PB) injury group; and group E (E1-E2), respectively normal group, IGHL injury group. RESULTS: For complete shoulder joint (A1 group), there was very small average shift (15.00+/-4.99 mm), for A4 group, there was the worst stability of shoulder joint, the average shift was 22.34+/-5.70 mm. For B2 group, the stability of shoulder joint had no obvious decrease. For B3 group, the stability of shoulder joint was worst at abduction angle of 45 degrees and 90 degrees. For C2 group, the stability of shoulder joint at abduction angle of 45 degrees (23.19+/-4.58 mm) and 90 degrees (15.32+/-1.30 mm) was worse than that of A1 group (P{\textless}0.05); half-dislocation or dislocation could be seen. For D2 group (17.30+/-4.93 mm), there was less effect on anterior stability of shoulder joint than that of A1 group (P{\textless}0.05). For E2 group (20.26+/-4.75 mm), the effect on anterior stability was similar to C2 group. CONCLUSION: GHL is a key static stabilizing structure of shoulder joint. SGHL has no obvious effect on anterior stability of shoulder joint. MGHL and IGHL together holds anterior stability of shoulder joint, and IGHL plays the most important role.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Balloon kyphoplasty is a not widely used method for the treatment of vertebral burst fractures with displacement of the posterior wall. The purpose of this study was to measure the posterior height of the vertebral body and the posttraumatic canal surface area before and after balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of burst fractures (Magerl A3). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This anatomic study was conducted on ten experimental burst fractures of the thoracolumar junction prepared on cadaver specimens. The surface area of the canal and the height of the posterior wall were measured by computed tomography before and after balloon kyphoplasty. These two variables were then compared with search for correlation. RESULTS: The posttraumatic canal surface area increased significantly after kyphoplasty (p=0.02). Gain in posterior height was not significant and there was no correlation between the two variables. Cement leakage into the canal was not observed. DISCUSSION: It is known that balloon kyphoplasty can re-establish anterior height and correct for the posttraumatic kyphosis in patients with compression fractures of osteoporotic vertebrae. The present cadaver study shows that when the posterior wall is displaced posteriorly, balloon expansion does not exaggerate the wall displacement. On the contrary, the posttraumatic canal surface area is increased due to the ligamentotaxis effect. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty could be an alternative to posterior instrumentation for burst fractures without associated neurological deficit, even if the posterior wall is damaged. This technique can be used to reduce and stabilize the fracture while sparing the adjacent levels and limiting the risk inherent with an extensive surgical approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional open anterior approaches to the TL spine were reported with a significant morbidity from a large wound field; therefore, "minimally invasive" thoracoscopic and laparoscopic anterior approaches have been recently introduced. However, these endoscopic techniques require a long and steep learning curve, require expensive disposable endoscopy material, and may be little suited for complication management. Alternatively, "mini-open" anterior approaches with table-mounted retractor systems have also been recently introduced. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients underwent a single-level thoracic or lumbar corpectomy and cage reconstruction for an unstable traumatic burst fracture or vertebral body tumor. A transthoracic (n = 6), transthoracic transdiaphragmatic (n = 23), or retroperitoneal (n = 8) mini-open approach was conducted with the SynFrame (Stratec Medical, Oberdorf, Switzerland) table-mounted retractor. Prior posterior pedicle screw fixation was performed in 35 of 37 patients. RESULTS: The mean surgical duration of the anterior approach was 181 minutes, and the average blood loss was 632 mL. There was no neurological worsening. On a VAS from 0 to 10, the mean local pain from the anterior approach was 1.7 at 6 months postoperatively, 1.4 at 12 months, and 1.0 at 24 months. Construct stability was found in all patients at 6 months after surgery. Six transient complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The mini-open anterior approach for corpectomy in the TL spine is safe, reliable, and economical. The table-mounted SynFrame retractor provides a stable operating field through which a familiar direct 3-dimensional view of the anterior TL spine is obtained with limited approach morbidity. This technique is an excellent alternative to thoracoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, avoiding the steep learning curve, technical difficulties, and equipment costs of endoscopic procedures.},

A hematoma was detected from the T12 to L2 area in a 36-year-old male patient with a T12 burst fracture. On the same day, the patient underwent in situ posterior pedicle instrumentation on T10-L3 with no additional laminectomy. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient suddenly developed weakness and sensory changes in both extremities, together with a sharp pain. A MRI showed that the hematoma had definitely increased in size. A partial laminectomy was performed 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Two days after surgery, recovery of neurological function was noted. This case shows that spinal surgeons need to be aware of the possible occurrence of a delayed aggravated SEH and neurological deterioration after a spinal fracture.},

METHODS: A total of 48 cases (31 males and 17 females, aged from 18-72 years, mean: 41.3 years) with thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture were treated by pedicle screw system since January 2004. According to the AO classification of thoracolumbar vertebrae fracture, there are 36 cases of Type A, 9 of Type B and 3 of Type C. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 6-25 months (average 12 months), no secondary nerve root injury, spinal cord injury, loosening or breakage of pedicle screw were observed. The nerve function of 29 patients with cauda equina nerve injury was restored to different degrees. The vertebral body height returned to normal level and posterior process angle was rectified after operation. CONCLUSIONS: The vertebral pedicle screw internal fixation was technologically applicable, which can efficiently reposition and stabilize the bursting fractured vertebrae, indirectly decompress canalis spinalis, maintain spine stability, scatter stress of screw system, reduce the risk of loosening or breakage of screw and loss of vertebral height, and prevent the formation of posterior convex after operation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Several studies report a favorable short-term outcome after nonoperatively treated two-column thoracic or lumbar burst fractures in patients without neurological deficits. Few reports have described the long-term clinical and radiological outcome after these fractures, and none have, to our knowledge, specifically evaluated the long-term outcome of the discs adjacent to the fractured vertebra, often damaged at injury and possibly at an increased risk of height reduction and degeneration with subsequent chronic back pain. PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term clinical and radiological outcome after nonoperatively treated thoracic or lumbar burst fractures in adults, with special attention to posttraumatic radiological disc height reduction. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Sixteen men with a mean age of 31 years (range, 19-44) and 11 women with a mean age of 40 years (range, 23-61) had sustained a thoracic or lumbar burst fracture during the years 1965 to 1973. Four had sustained a burst fracture Denis type A, 18 a Denis type B, 1 a Denis type C, and 4 a Denis type E. Seven of these patients had neurological deficits at injury, all retrospectively classified as Frankel D. OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical outcome was evaluated subjectively with Oswestry score and questions regarding work capacity and objectively with the Frankel scale. The radiological outcome was evaluated with measurements of local kyphosis over the fractured segment, ratios of anterior and posterior vertebral body heights, adjacent disc heights, pedicle widths, sagittal width of the spinal canal, and lateral and anteroposterior displacement. METHODS: From the radiographical archives of an emergency hospital, all patients with a nonoperatively treated thoracic or lumbar burst fracture during the years 1965 to 1973 were registered. The fracture type, localization, primary treatment, and outcome were evaluated from the old radiographs, referrals, and reports. Twenty-seven individuals were clinically and radiologically evaluated a mean of 27 years (range, 23-41) after the injury. RESULTS: At follow-up, 21 former patients reported no or minimal back pain or disability (Oswestry Score mean 4; range, 0-16), whereas 6 former patients (of whom 3 were classified as Frankel D at baseline) reported moderate or severe disability (Oswestry Score mean 39; range, 26-54). Six former patients were classified as Frankel D, and the rest as Frankel E. Local kyphosis had increased by a mean of 3 degrees (p{\textless}.05), whereas the discs adjacent to the fractured vertebrae remained unchanged in height during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperatively treated burst fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine in adults with or without minor neurological deficits have a predominantly favorable long-term outcome, and there seems to be no increased risk for subsequent disc height reduction in the adjacent discs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of intrafocal pinning  (IFP) and volar locking plating (VLP) of dorsally angulated, unstable distal radius fractures in elderly patients. METHODS: The subjects were 62 consecutive patients over 60 years of age with dorsally angulated, unstable distal radius fractures treated with IFP or VLP. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at first examination. The range of motion and grip strength were measured at follow-up examinations, and ulnar variance (UV) was measured on radiographs at baseline and follow-up postoperative examinations. RESULTS: There were no notable differences in gender, age, follow-up period, baseline UV, BMD, and AO classification between IFP and VLP groups. There was no difference between the UV in VLP immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up examination; however, IFP showed a significant loss of reduction as measured by UV. In patients with UV more than 5 mm or BMD less than 70{\%} of young adult mean (YAM) at first examination, UV increased again at the final follow-up examination in IFP, while surgically corrected UV was maintained in VLP, independent of the degree of baseline UV and BMD. VLP resulted in earlier recovery of postoperative range of motion and grip strength compared with IFP. The range of flexion and the grip strength value were significantly larger in VLP at final examination. CONCLUSIONS: VLP, but not IFP, can maintain surgically corrected UV in distal radius fractures, independent of the degrees of initial UV and BMD. VLP enhances earlier recovery in range of motion and grip strength than IFP. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.},

METHODS: Thirteen patients (8 males, 5 females; age, 16-65 years; weight, 50-75 kg) who had undergone major spine operations were enrolled in this study. Eleven of them had undergone anterior decompression, who were given the grafting and the internal fixation for their thoraco-lumber spinal burst fractures; the other 2 patients were given the correction operation for their scoliosis. The baselines of the haematocrit (Hct) were 0.363-0.481 before operation. The patients had no cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal dysfunction or coagulation abnormality. The hemodynamic status and the haematocrit were observed during operation. The parameters of thromboelastography (TEG), arterial blood gas, and electrolytes were measured and observed at the following time points: before AEHH, after AEHH, 60 minutes after AEHH, 120 minutes after AEHH, and the end of the operation. The total fluid volume was recorded. RESULTS: The autologous blood volume was 1 050-1 575 ml (average, 1 419 +/- 198 ml), plasma substitute 2 100-3 150 ml (average, 2 838 +/- 397 ml), blood loss 1 000-3 130 ml (average, 1 747 +/- 743 ml), urine 450-1 270 ml (average, 871 +/- 374 ml), and the net blood transfusion 1 206-2 661 ml (1 863 +/- 598 ml). The homogenous blood of 400 ml was transfused in 1 patient for making up the blood loss of 3 130 ml. There were no statistically significant differences in the hemodynamic measurements, arterial blood gas, and electrolyte variables when compared with the baseline values before the hemodilution (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The reaction time of TEG was longer 60 minutes after AEHH than before AEHH (P {\textless} 0.05); the other parameters of TEG had no differences when compared with the baseline values (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The AEHH is safe and efficient in reduction of the perioperative homogenous blood transfusion in spine surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore an improved surgical approach to the superior posterior partial resection of the fractured vertebral body followed by the single segmental fusion to treat lumbar burst fracture and to evaluate its preliminary clinical application. METHODS: From June to October 2006, 4 patients (2 males, 2 females; age, 17-39 years ) with Denis B type lumbar burst fracture underwent the superior posterior partial resection of the fractured vertebral body followed by the single segmental fusion. The fracture occurred in 2 patients at L1 and 2 at L2. According to the Frankel scales assessment, before operation, 2 patients were at Grade B and the other 2 at Grade C, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) was 7.00 +/- 0.82. Radiological evaluation was performed, which revealed the kyphosis Cobb angel of 22.94 +/- 11.21 degrees, the adjacent superior and the inferior intervertebal disc heights of 12.78 +/- 1.52 mm and 11.68 +/- 1.04 mm, respectively, and the vertebral canal sagittal diameter of 9.56 +/- 2.27 mm on the computer tomography (CT) scan. The neurological and the radiological evaluations were also made immediately and 3 months after operation. RESULTS: The anterior single segmental decompression and fusion operations were performed successfully in all the patients. The average operating time was 166 +/- 29 min and the average amount of blood loss was 395 +/- 54 ml. The Frankel scales assessment showed that at the time immediately after operation, one of the 2 Grade B patients had an improvement to Grade C, but the other patient had no improvement. One of the 2 Grade C patients had an improvement to Grade D, but the other patient had no improvement. Three months after operation, the 2 Grade B patients had an improvement to Grade C. The 2 grade C patients had an improvement to Grade D or E. The VAS score was significantly decreased to 3.50 +/- 1.29 after operation and to 1.25 +/- 0.50 3 months later (P {\textless} 0.05). The vertebral canal sagittal diameter was significantly increased to 19.76 +/- 3.82 mm (P {\textless} 0.01), but it was maintained to 19.27 + 3.41 mm 3 months later, with no significant difference( P {\textgreater} 0.05). The patients' kyphosis Cobb angle was significantly improved to 8.71 +/- 5.41 degrees (P {\textless} 0.05) , but it was maintained to 9.52 +/- 5. 66 degrees 3 months later, with no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The heights of the adjacent discs remained unchanged. No complication was observed during and after operation, and the radiological and the CT scanning evaluations 3 months later showed no failure of the internal fixation. CONCLUSION: The superior and posterior partial resection of the fractured vertebral body followed by the single segmental fusion can effectively decompress the vertebral canal and maintain the spine stability in treatment of the Denis B type fracture though the long-term effectiveness requires a further follow-up.},

abstract = {AIM: Even today, different opinions can be found concerning realignment loss of the adjoining intervertebral disc after fracture followed by dorsal fusion. There is still disagreement on intervertebral disc excision and the subsequent necessity of intercorporal fusion. METHOD: In this context, fractures of the thoracolumbar transition and its operative repair via instrumented bisegmental dorsal fusion at T11 - L1 and T12 - L2, respectively, have been examined. Immediately after the accident and after removal of the implant, sagittal MR images (T1-, TE-, T2-weighted) with a standard 4 mm slice thickness were made. Eighteen patients with fractures of the thoracolumbar transition (A3 and B1 according to the AO classification) could be included in this study. All fractures were of traumatic genesis. The implant was removed after an average of ten months. RESULTS: Allowing for planimetric measuring errors, our analysis generated a 14 {\%} volume decrease of the upper and a 15 {\%} volume decrease of the lower intervertebral disc. A volume change of 3 {\%} in the bridged or fractured vertebral body was found to be without any verifiable significance. Tendentially, a slight volume loss of both adjacent intervertebral discs could be observed. CONCLUSION: In our opinion, the realignment loss after a mean ten months cannot be explained by the volume changes of the discs alone. The creeping of the intervertebral disc into the adjacent vertebral body accounts for the post-traumatic malalignment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Various percent canal occlusion measurement methods have been used to assess the spinal canal stenosis following a thoracolumbar burst fracture. However, there are no studies performed comparing these techniques. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of three techniques used to measure the spinal canal stenosis in thoracolumbar burst fractures on lateral radiograph and CT scans, and to identify the most reliable and practical method of assessment. METHODS: Fifty preoperative lateral radiographs and axial computed tomography (CT) scans of thoracolumbar burst fractures were analyzed by five observers in two sessions. The three measurement techniques were tested: the ratio of sagittal diameter of spinal canal at the injury level to that at the adjacent level on lateral plain radiographs (Ratio 1) and on axial CT scans (Ratio 2); and the ratio of cross-sectional area of spinal canal at the injury level to that at the adjacent level on axial CT scans (Ratio 3). Interobserver and intraobserver reliability for each measure was assessed. RESULTS: Greater coefficient of variation (CV) of measurement was founded for the Ratio 1 obtained from lateral plain radiographs than the other two ratios (Ratio 2 and 3) from CT scans (P{\textless}0.05), while no differences of CV were noted between the Ratio 2 and Ratio 3 with CT scans (P{\textgreater}0.05). There was no significant improvement (P{\textgreater}0.05) of the interobserver agreement after a 3-month interval for all three methods. A high significant positive correlation was observed between Ratio 1 and Ratio 2, Ratio 1 and Ratio 3, and Ratio 2 and Ratio 3 (P{\textless}0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: CT scans are more reliable than plain radiographs in the evaluation of spinal canal occlusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures although the agreement might be acceptable for the latter. Measurement of sagittal diameter of spinal canal using CT scan might be a more reasonable choice than of cross-sectional area of spinal canal because of its simplicity and comparable measurement reliability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The major problem after posterior correction and instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures is failure to support the anterior spinal column leading to loss of correction of kyphosis and hardware breakage. We conducted a prospective consecutive series to evaluate the outcome of the management of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures by transpedicular hydroxyapatite (HA) grafting following indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients who had thoracolumbar burst fractures and associated incomplete neurological deficit were operatively treated within four days of admission. Following indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation, transpedicular intracorporeal HA grafting to the fractured vertebrae was performed. Mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 150 ml. Their implants were removed within one year and were prospectively followed for at least two years. RESULTS: The neurological function of all 18 patients improved by at least one ASIA grade, with nine (50{\%}) patients demonstrating complete neurological recovery. Sagittal alignment was improved from a mean preoperative kyphosis of 17 degrees to -2 degrees (lordosis) by operation, but was found to have slightly deteriorated to 1 degrees at final followup observation. The CT images demonstrated a mean spinal canal narrowing preoperatively, immediate postoperative and at final followup of 60{\%}, 22{\%} and 11{\%}, respectively. There were no instances of hardware failure. No patient reported severe pain or needed daily dosages of analgesics at the final followup. The two-year postoperative MRI demonstrated an increase of one grade in disc degeneration (n = 17) at the disc above and in 11 patients below the fractured vertebra. At the final followup, flexion-extension radiographs revealed that a median range of motion was 4, 6 and 34 degrees at the cranial segment of the fractured vertebra, caudal segment and L1-S1, respectively. Bone formation by osteoconduction in HA granules was unclear, but final radiographs showed healed fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior indirect reduction, transpedicular HA grafting and pedicle screw fixation could prevent the development of kyphosis and should lead to reliable neurological improvement in patients with incomplete neurological deficit. This technique does not require fusion to a segment, thereby preserves thoracolumbar motion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-segment fixation alone to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures is common but it has a 20-50{\%} incidence of implant failure and rekyphosis. A transpedicle body augmenter (TpBA) to reinforce the vertebral body via posterior approach has been reported to prevent implant failure and increase the clinical success rate in treating burst fracture. This article is to evaluate the longterm results of short-segment fixation with TpBA for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients included in the study had a single-level burst fracture involving T11-L2 and no distraction or rotation element with limited neurological deficit. Patients in the control group (n = 42) were treated with short-segment posterior instrumentation alone, whereas patients in the augmented group (n = 90) were treated with a titanium spacer designed for transpedicle body reconstruction. The followup was 48-101 months. The radiographic and clinical results were evaluated and compared by Student's t test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The blood loss, operation time and hospitalization were similar in both the groups. The immediate postoperative anterior vertebral restoration rate of the augmented group was similar to that of the control group (97.6{\%} +/- 2.4{\%} vs. 96.6{\%} +/- 3.2{\%}). The final anterior vertebral restoration was greater in the augmented group than in the control group (93.3{\%} +/- 3.4{\%} vs. 62.5{\%} +/- 11.2{\%}). Immediate postoperative kyphotic angles were not significantly different between the groups (3.0 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees vs. 5.1 degrees +/- 2.3 degrees ). The final kyphotic angles were less in the augmented group than the control group (7.3 degrees +/- 3.5 degrees vs. 20.1 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees ). The augmented group had less (P {\textless} 0.001) implant failure [0{\%} (n=0) vs. 23.8{\%} (n=10)] for the control group) and more patients (P {\textless} 0.001) with no pain or minimal or occasional pain (Grade P1 or P2) than the control group [90.0{\%} (n=81) vs. 66.7{\%} (n=28)]. All patients in the augmented group and 39 (92.8{\%}) patients in the control group experienced neurological recovery to Frankel Grade E. Three patients in the control group had improvement to Frankel Grade D from Frankel Grade C, but later had deterioration to Frankel Grade C because of loosening and dislodgement of the implant. CONCLUSION: Posterior body reconstruction with TpBA can maintain kyphosis correction and vertebral restoration, prevent implant failure and lead to better clinical results.},

On admission six (26{\%}) out of 23 patients had neurological deficit (five incomplete, one complete). Bilateral transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty with liquid calcium phosphate to reduce segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height and short (three vertebrae) pedicle screw instrumentation with posterolateral fusion was performed. Gardner kyphosis angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height ratio and spinal canal encroachment were calculated pre- to postoperatively. RESULTS: All 23 patients were operated within two days after admission and were followed for at least 12 months after index surgery. Operating time and blood loss averaged 45 min and 60 cc respectively. The five patients with incomplete neurological lesions improved by at least one ASIA grade, while no neurological deterioration was observed in any case. The VAS and SF-36 (Role physical and Bodily pain domains) were significantly improved postoperatively. Overall sagittal alignment was improved from an average preoperative 16 degrees to one degree kyphosis at final followup observation. The anterior vertebral body height ratio improved from 0.6 preoperatively to 0.9 (P{\textless}0.001) postoperatively, while posterior vertebral body height improved from 0.95 to 1 (P{\textless}0.01). Spinal canal encroachment was reduced from an average 32{\%} preoperatively to 20{\%} postoperatively. Cement leakage was observed in four cases (three anterior to vertebral body and one into the disc without sequalae). In the last CT evaluation, there was a continuity between calcium phosphate and cancellous vertebral body bone. Posterolateral radiological fusion was achieved within six months after index operation. There was no instrumentation failure or measurable loss of sagittal curve and vertebral height correction in any group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement secured with posterior short fixation in the thoracolumbar spine provided excellent immediate reduction of posttraumatic segmental kyphosis and significant spinal canal clearance and restored vertebral body height in the fracture level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy continues regarding the best treatment for compression and burst fractures. The axial distraction reduction utilizing the technique employing the long straight rod or curved short rod without derotation to reduce fracture are practised together with short segment posterolateral fusion (PLF). Effects of the early postoperative mobilization without posterolateral fusion on reduction maintenance and fracture consolidation were not evaluated so far. The present prospective study is designed to assess the effectiveness of i) reduction and restoration of sagittal alignment, ii) no posterolateral fusion on the reduced, fractured vertebral body and injured disc, iii) fracture consolidation and iv) the fate of the unfused cephalad and caudal injured motion segments of the fractured vertebra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study includes 15 Denis burst and two Denis type D compression fractures between T(12) and L(3). The lordotic distraction technique was used for ligamentotaxis utilizing the contoured short rods and pedicle screw fixator. Three vertebrae including the fractured one were fixed. The patients after surgery were braced for ten weeks with activity restriction for 2-4 weeks. The patients were evaluated for change in vertebral body height, sagittal curve, reduction of retropulsion, improvement in neural deficit. The unfused motion segments, residual postoperative pain and bone and metal failure were also evaluated. RESULTS: The preoperative and postreduction percentile vertebral heights at, zero (immediate postoperative), at three, six and 12 months followup were 62.4, 94.8, 94.6, 94.5 and 94.5{\%}, respectively. The percentages of the intracanal fragment retropulsion at preoperative, and postoperative at zero, 3, 6 and 12 months followup were 59.0, 36.2,, 36.0, 32.3, and 13.6{\%} respectively. The preoperative and postreduction percentile loss of the canal dimension and at zero, three, six and 12 months were 52.1, 45.0, 44.0, 41.0 and 29{\%} respectively suggesting that the under-reduced fragment was being resorbed gradually by a remodeling process. The mean initial kyphosis of 33 degrees became mean 2 degrees immediately after reduction and mean 3 degrees at the final followup. The fractured vertebral bodies consolidated in an average period of ten weeks (range 8-14 weeks). The restored disc heights were relatively well maintained throughout the observation period. All paraparetic patients recovered neurologically. There were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Instrument-aided ligamentotaxis for compression and burst fractures utilizing the short contoured rod derotation technique and the instrumented stabilization of the fractured spine are found to be effective procedures which contribute to the fractured vertebral body consolidation without recollapse and maintain the motion segment function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced diagnostic tools, classification systems and accordingly selected surgical approaches are essential requirements for the prevention of failure of surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The present study is designed to evaluate the contribution of classification to the choice of a surgical approach using the current fracture classification systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied prospectively a group of 64 patients (22 females, 42 males) of an average age of 43 years, all operated on for thoracolumbar fractures during the year 2001. The AO-ASIF classification was used preoperatively with all imaging studies (X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). When the damage was detected only in the anterior column (A type), an isolated anterior stabilization (n = 22) was preferred. If the MRI study disclosed an injury in the posterior column, a posterior approach (n = 20) using the internal fixator was chosen. Injuries involving the posterior column (B or C type) were classified additionally according to the load-sharing classification (LSC). If LSC gave six or more points, treatment was completed with an anterior fusion. The combined postero-anterior procedure was carried out 22 times. The minimum followup period was 22 months. RESULTS: Neither implant failure and nor significant loss of correction were observed in patients treated with anterior or combined procedures. The average loss of correction (increase of kyphosis) in simple posterior stabilization was 3.1 degree. CONCLUSION: Complex fracture classification helps in the selection of the surgical approach and helps to decrease the chances of treatment failure.},

abstract = {The most common site of injury to the spine is the thoracolumbar junction which is the mechanical transition junction between the rigid thoracic and the more flexible lumbar spine. The lumbar spine is another site which is more prone to injury. Absence of stabilizing articulations with the ribs, lordotic posture and more sagitally oriented facet joints are the most obvious explanations. Burst fractures of the spine account for 14{\%} of all spinal injuries. Though common, thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures present a number of important treatment challenges. There has been substantial controversy related to the indications for nonoperative or operative management of these fractures. Disagreement also exists regarding the choice of the surgical approach. A large number of thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures can be treated conservatively while some fractures require surgery. Selecting an appropriate surgical option requires an in-depth understanding of the different methods of decompression, stabilization and/or fusion. Anterior surgery has the advantage of the greatest degree of canal decompression and offers the benefit of limiting the number of motion segments fused. These advantages come at the added cost of increased time for the surgery and the related morbidity of the surgical approach. Posterior surgery enjoys the advantage of being more familiar to the operating surgeons and can be an effective approach. However, the limitations of this approach include inadequate decompression, recurrence of the deformity and implant failure. Though many of the principles are the same, the treatment of low lumbar burst fractures requires some additional consideration due to the difficulty of approaching this region anteriorly. Avoiding complications of these surgeries are another important aspect and can be achieved by following an algorithmic approach to patient assessment, proper radiological examination and precision in decision-making regarding management. A detailed understanding of the mechanism of injury and their unique biomechanical propensities following various forms of treatment can help the spinal surgeon manage such patients effectively and prevent devastating complications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current literature implies that the use of short-segment pedicle screw fixation for spinal fractures is dangerous and inappropriate because of its high failure rate, but favorable results have been reported. The purpose of this study is to report the short term results of thoracolumbar burst and compression fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation. METHODS: A retrospective review of all surgically managed thoracolumbar fractures during six years were performed. The 19 surgically managed patients were instrumented by the short-segment technique. Patients' charts, operation notes, preoperative and postoperative radiographs (sagittal index, sagittal plane kyphosis, anterior body compression, vertebral kyphosis, regional kyphosis), computed tomography scans, neurological findings (Frankel functional classification), and follow-up records up to 12-month follow-up were reviewed. RESULTS: No patients showed an increase in neurological deficit. A statistically significant difference existed between the patients preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, sagittal plane kyphosis, anterior body compression, vertebral kyphosis and regional kyphosis. One screw pullout resulted in kyphotic angulation, one screw was misplaced and one patient suffered angulation of the proximal segment on follow-up, but these findings were not related to the radiographic findings. Significant bending of screws or hardware breakage were not encountered. CONCLUSION: Although long term follow-up evaluation needs to verified, the short term follow-up results suggest a favorable outcome for short-segment instrumentation. When applied to patients with isolated spinal fractures who were cooperative with 3-4 months of spinal bracing, short-segment pedicle screw fixation using the posterior approach seems to provide satisfactory result.},

abstract = {Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs have traditionally been required to clear the thoracolumbar spine (TLS) after blunt trauma. The routine use of CT scans led to a pilot trial to determine if CT scout images can accurately evaluate the TLS after blunt trauma. The purpose of the study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CT scout images for the evaluation of the TLS. Patients admitted to our level II trauma center requiring CT evaluation of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were considered for this study. Patients with blunt trauma, without neurologic deficits, or other evidence of spinal trauma on physical examination were included. Charts were reviewed for demographics, scout CT image findings, and full CT scan findings. Scout CT images were compared with reconstructed spine CT scans from chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans. Injuries to the TLS were defined as compression fractures, burst fractures, and subluxation. One hundred seventeen patients were included. Average Injury Severity Score was 25.1 (+/-9.4) and average age was 42.5 years. Twenty-three patients had diffuse back tenderness, three had ecchymosis, and 64 had distracting injuries. Twelve injuries to the TLS were present; 11 were seen on scout images. Sensitivity was 92 per cent, specificity 100 per cent, positive predictive value 100 per cent, and negative predictive value 99 per cent. Scout CT images provide an accurate assessment of the TLS after blunt trauma. We are encouraged by the results and will continue to investigate to identify the criteria that allow scout CT images to safely replace anteroposterior and lateral radiographs in the evaluation of the TLS in blunt trauma.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Motor vehicle collision (MVC) is one of the most common causes of thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) injury. Although there is little doubt that the use of seat belts reduces the incidence and severity of TLJ injury after MVC, the mechanism by which this is protective against TLJ injury for drivers and passengers is relatively unknown. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with TLJ (T11-L2) injury who were front seat occupants of a four-wheeled vehicle at the time of MVC (frontal crash) were admitted between 2000 and 2004. The 39 patients were divided into two groups: 18 who had been restrained and 21 who had not been restrained at the time of the MVC. Patient demographics, including the mean Injury Severity Scale score, incidence of neurological deficit, level of TLJ injury, and type of TLJ injury according to the Denis classification were compared. RESULTS: The incidence of neurological deficit in the restrained group was significantly lower compared with the nonrestrained group (5.6{\%} compared with 33.3{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). The incidence of flexion-distraction/fracture-dislocation injuries in the restrained group was also significantly lower (0.0{\%} compared with 33.3{\%} in the nonrestrained group, p {\textless} 0.01). The restrained group was significantly older (37.4 +/- 3.6 years compared with 28.0 +/- 2.5 years in the nonrestrained group, p {\textless} 0.05), but otherwise there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' demographic data. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the high incidence of neurological deficit in the nonrestrained front seat motor vehicle occupants who had a TLJ injury was mostly due to the high incidence of flexion-distraction/fracture-dislocation injuries. This retrospective study indirectly shows the efficacy of three-point seat belt systems in reducing the severity of a TLJ injury after an MVC. Compression/burst fractures still occur in restrained front seat occupants, however, and elucidation of the injury mechanism of such axial loading fractures may be important to improve safety further for automobile occupants.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of short-segment posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures and investigated correlations between radiographic and functional results as well as factors that affected correction losses. METHODS: We reviewed 48 patients (30 males, 18 females; mean age 40+/-14 years; range 18 to 67 years) who underwent short-segment posterior instrumentation with pedicle screws and fusion. The most common involvement was at L1 in 18 patients (37.5{\%}), followed by T12 in 11 patients (22.9{\%}). According to the Frankel grading system, six patients had complete, 14 patients had incomplete neurologic deficits. The Cobb angles were measured, and canal remodeling was assessed by computed tomography. Modified functional results were derived using the Denis pain and work scales. The mean follow-up was 21.7+/-9.1 months (range 12 to 48 months). RESULTS: The mean correction in the Cobb angle was 18.2+/-8.6 degrees (p{\textless}0.01), the mean correction loss was 7.4+/-5.7 degrees (p{\textless}0.01), and the mean canal remodeling was 51.3+/-9.3{\%} (p{\textless}0.001). There was a significant correlation between Cobb angle correction and correction loss (r=0.38, p{\textless}0.01). An intraoperative correction of greater than 15 degrees was significantly associated with a greater correction loss (p{\textless}0.05). Patients with a correction loss of more than 10 degrees had a significantly poorer Denis pain score and modified functional result (p{\textless}0.05). Modified functional results were excellent in 16 patients (33.3{\%}), good in 23 patients (47.9{\%}), fair in seven patients (14.6{\%}), and poor in two patients (4.2{\%}). At final follow-ups, the Cobb angle was not correlated with functional results (p{\textgreater}0.05). All the patients having incomplete neurologic deficits improved by at least 1 Frankel grade. CONCLUSION: An intraoperative correction exceeding 15 degrees is significantly associated with a greater correction loss, which in turn has a significantly adverse effect on functional results.},

RESULTS: Pain status of all patients improved after surgery: 4 had severe and 3 had mild pain preoperatively; in 3 pain became minimal and 4 had none postoperatively. All patients except one had Frankel/American Spinal Injury Association scores of E after surgery indicating complete recovery of sensory and motor function. There were no complications related to surgery or instrumentation construct. At the time of review, one patient had died of old age 8.6 years after surgery and another from local recurrence and lung metastasis 5.7 years after surgery. All other patients were living.

abstract = {Mechanical constraints to spine motion can arise in a variety of real-world situations such as when shoulder belts prevent anterior translation of the thorax during automotive collisions. The effect of such constraint on spinal column-spinal cord interaction during injury remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to compare maximal dynamic spinal canal occlusion, measured via a specialized transducer, in cadaveric upper thoracic spine specimens under a variety of anterior-posterior constraint conditions. Four injury models were produced using 24 cadaveric spine specimens (T1-T4). Incremental compressive trauma was applied under constrained (i.e. blocked anterior-posterior translation) flexion-compression, pure-compression and extension-compression, and under unconstrained (i.e. free anterior-posterior translation) flexion-compression. All displacements were applied at 500 mm/s. For all three constrained trauma groups, complete transducer occlusion occurred between 20 and 30 mm of compressive displacement. The extension-compression caused transducer occlusion significantly less than the other constrained models (p {\textless} 0.022) at 20 mm compression. For unconstrained flexion-compression, a compression of up to 50 mm resulted in a mean of 26{\%} transducer occlusion. The constrained pure-compression tests led to burst fracture with significant body height loss at T2. The constrained flexion-compression and extension-compression tests caused fracture-dislocation injury at the T2-T3 level. Constrained trauma clearly led to more spinal canal occlusion than the unconstrained in these models, and more severe injury to the spinal column. The results add to our understanding of the effect of column injury pattern on spinal cord injury. This information has clear implications for the design of injury prevention devices.},

abstract = {AIM: The authors assessed options for vertebral body replacements with the Synex  telescopic expansion cage. Autologic or homologic bone grafts, a titanium "Harm's" cage or a polymethylmetacrylate filling reinforced by Kirschner wires, may be used for vertebral body replacements. The cement filling is indicated in oncological patients, the Harm's cage requires filling with a quantity of bone grafts and, with massive bone grafts, the collection place or the graft availability may be a problem. The telescopic expansion implant is fairly easy to implant, is stable and requires to be filled with a minimum of spongious grafts. MATERIAL: From May 2001 to November 2005, 20 telescopic Synex cages were implanted in 18 patients. Vertebral body replacements were performed 14x for acute fractures, 4x for posttraumatic kyphosis and 2x for metastatic skeletal disorder in breast and prostate tumors. METHODS: Vertebral body replacement was completed with posterior transpedicular stabilization in 14 subjects, in 5 subjects, additional anterior Ventrofix stabilization was performed. Vertebral body replacements down to the L1 level were conducted through thoracotomy or video-assissted minithoracotomy, L2-L4 replacements from lumbotomy or anterior retroperitoneal approach. RESULTS: The most requently affected and operated vertebrae included the L1 (4 patients), Th12 (4 patients), Th6 (3 patients). The minimal interval between the procedure and a follow- up was 12 months. No fatal outcome has been recorded. In one patient with a vertebral body metastasis, the disorder has generalized and in a second one, no further metastatic spread has been reported. In one subject, the left-sided L4 root injury was recorded postoperatively, a cauda equina syndrome, diagnosed after the injury, persits in one subject. No signs of deep infection have been recorded. There are no records of the Synex release or displacement. Correction loss (kyphotisation) of up to 2 degrees was recorded in patients with transpedicular stabilization, in Ventrofix patients the loss was up to 5 degrees, except one case, where the loss reached 10 degrees. DISCUSSION: One of the commonest indications for the anterior approach surgical stabilization of the spine, is the vertebral body destruction in burst fractures or posstraumatic kyphotizations of the spinal column. Unhealed or poorly healed type A and B (AO classification) pincer vertebral body fractures are other common indications for partial corpectomy and vertebral body replacements. Such fractures can be managed using posterior transpedicular stabilization. However, provided the procedure results in insufficient fracture repositioning, the anterior procedure and the anterior column reconstruction must be performed. A vertebral body can be replaced by a bone graft, a cement filling with Kirschner wiring, a traditional Harm's cage or an expansion implant. The bone graft may be autologic, which involves a disadvantage of the "donor site pain", or homologic, although a potential for reconstruction is not fully evidenced here. Implant migration into the vertebral body has been recorded in the classical titanium Harm's cage with a sharp edge without an additional endplate. Furthermore, it is a rather complicated implantation, requiring an exact implant size, which is considered another disadvantage. The expansion implant may be expanded telescopically in the very place, which is considered its biggest advantage. Furthermore, it need not be filled with bone grafts, but is applied only ventrally or laterally to the cage. CONCLUSION: The Synex titanium expansion implant has been designed for vertebral body implantations in any indication. It requires additional stabilization, either by an anterior fixator or a cast, or a posterior transpedicular fixation. It is primarily indicated in traumatic vertebral body destructions or in reconstructions of maltreated fractures. Considering its higher price and the expected shorter patient survival period in oncological patients, its use in oncological indications is controversial.},

abstract = {The inflammatory response after severe blunt chest trauma often leads to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome which are associated with high mortality rates. Whereas the role of innate immunity in acute lung injury has been broadly investigated, the immune response after blunt chest trauma is still poorly understood. Therefore, the role of complement and neutrophils was determined in bilateral lung injury induced by a single blast wave. The following time-points were investigated posttrauma: sham, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. There was a time-dependent systemic activation of complement as determined by CH-50 and presence of C5a-dependent chemotactic plasma activity. Moreover, factor H, a complement regulatory protein, was increased systemically and locally after injury. Anti-C5a treatment immediately after trauma ameliorated these peaks. After an initial systemic leukopenic phase, a marked leukocytosis occurred. The latter was normalized by C5a blockade. In parallel, white blood cell count in bronchioalveolar lavage fluids was increased as a function of time and was significantly decreased by anti-C5a treatment. Trauma-induced lung injury was also associated with dramatic changes in neutrophil function, namely early enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis, followed by prolonged functional defects-all of which were ameliorated by anti-C5a treatment. Furthermore, blockade of C5a ameliorated the buildup of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, diminished the increase of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1, and altered the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data suggest that blunt chest trauma leads to systemic activation of complement and robust C5a generation, which causes perturbations in defensive functions of neutrophils. Thus, C5a might represent a potential target for therapeutic immunomodulation to prevent immune dysfunctions post-trauma and thereby, perhaps, the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Controlled in vitro trial. OBJECTIVE: To study vertebral strength in relation to cement augmentation technique after vertebroplasty and to assess the influence of the biomechanical compression model on postoperative results. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, the role of vertebroplasty has been well established. Biomechanical compression models thus far used, compressing vertebrae by only 25{\%} of their initial height, did not show a correlation between cement augmentation volumes and postoperative compression strength. In these studies, even very small volumes of cement seem effective. However, these models may not realistically simulate clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures. We hypothesize that, in clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures, postoperative vertebral body strength is strongly dependent on endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation. METHODS: Twenty-five intact osteoporotic cadaver vertebrae were obtained (10 lumbar, 15 thoracic). In 21 vertebrae, anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created by controlled external force, with preset height reduction by 35{\%}. After height reconstruction, 9 vertebrae were augmented endplate-to-endplate and 12 vertebrae were partially augmented with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Another 4 vertebrae were compressed by only 25{\%}. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. RESULTS: In the 35{\%} compression group, posttreatment strength was significantly decreased in vertebrae that were partially augmented with cement compared with the endplate-to-endplate augmented group (767 +/- 257 N vs. 1141 +/- 325 N, P {\textless} 0.01). Postoperative strength amounted 106{\%} +/- 27{\%} of preoperative strength values in the endplate-to-endplate augmented vertebrae, compared with 65{\%} +/- 18{\%} in the partially augmented vertebrae (P {\textless} 0.001). In the 25{\%} compression group, results in height restored and augmented vertebrae were similar to the nontreated vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: Endplate-to-endplate PMMA augmentation restores the biomechanical properties of vertebrae in clinically relevant anterior wedge fractures. Our preliminary data suggest that biomechanical models with only 25{\%} compressive deformation unlikely form a good model to assess the mechanical effects of cement augmentation in osteoporotic fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric biomechanical study and retrospective chart review. OBJECTIVE: Biomechanical comparison of segmental versus nonsegmental fixation of lumbar burst fractures and clinical analysis of short-term radiographic outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional short nonsegmental posterior fixation of thoracolumbar burst fractures suffers from high rates of failure. Construct stability may be improved by inserting additional screws at the fracture level. METHODS: Six intact human spines (L1-L3) were biomechanically tested in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial torsion. The inferior half of the L2 vertebral bodies and L2-L3 discs were resected to mimic an unstable L2 burst fracture with loss of anterior column support. Pedicle screws were inserted in L1 and L3 for the control group (nonsegmental fixation). Screws were inserted at all levels for the experimental group (segmental fixation). Construct stiffness and L1-L2 disc pressure were analyzed. Twelve patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with this type of segmental fixation were reviewed. RESULTS: Construct stiffness during axial torsion was significantly higher for segmental constructs compared with nonsegmental constructs (P {\textless} 0.02) with no differences between flexion-extension and lateral bending. Disc pressure fluctuations during flexion-extension were significantly higher for segmental compared with nonsegmental constructs (P {\textless} 0.02), with no differences in lateral bending and torsion. Mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 9 degrees and improved by 15 degrees after surgery. Follow-up films on 9 patients showed 5 degrees of kyphosis correction loss. Mean anterior vertebral body height was 58{\%} of normal before surgery. After surgery height was 89{\%} of normal and at final follow-up, 78{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Segmental fixation of burst fractures with screws at the level of the fracture offers improved biomechanical stability. Theoretically, segmental fixation provides for additional fixation points that may aid in fracture reduction and kyphosis correction. This specific parameter is not evaluated in this study but will be an important outcome measure for a planned randomized controlled trial.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcome and potential advantages of a percutaneous posterior approach to burst fractures of the thoraco-lumbar junction without neurological complications by means of a technique combining balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous pedicule screw fixation. METHODS: In this preliminary study patients who suffered traumatic of the thoraco-lumbar junction presented a Magerl type A3 fracture. The mean age of the patients was 64 years (54-78 years). All had a normal neurological examination. A combined technique using balloon kyphoplasty, that allows restoration of the vertebral height and fixation by means of cement injection with percutaneous osteosynthesis was performed as a minimal invasive alternative treatment. Mean follow-up (plain radiograph and CT scan, pain assessment) was 12 months (range 5-14 months). RESULTS: All patients experienced an early pain relief, successfully mobilized on day 1 after surgery and discharged after a mean stay of 4.5 days. Immediately postoperatively the mean vertebral height restoration was 11.5{\%} and the reduction of the kyphotic angle was 9 degrees. Those results were maintained over the complete follow-up period. Only one patient required analgesic treatment with weak opioids (step II of the WHO pain ladder) 3 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of burst fractures of the thoraco-lumbar junction with no neurological complication by associating minimally invasive techniques results in good fracture reduction and stabilisation. The main advantage of this approach is to shorten the hospital stay.},

abstract = {Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (type A3 in the classification of Magerl et al.) were studied prospectively for the evaluation of clinical, radiographic and functional results. The patients were submitted to surgical treatment by posterior arthrodesis, posterior fixation and autologous transpedicular graft. The patients were followed up for 2 years after surgery and assessed on the basis of clinical (pain, neurologic deficit, postoperative infection), radiographic (load sharing classification, Farcy s sagittal index of the fractured segment, relation between traumatic vertebral body height and the adjacent vertebrae (compression percentage), height of the intervertebral disk proximal and distal to the fractured vertebra, rupture or loosening of the implants) and functional (return to work, SF-36) criteria. Two patients presented a marked loss of correction and required the placement of an anterior support graft. Pain assessment revealed that eight patients (44{\%}) had no pain; four (22{\%}) had occasional pain, three (17{\%}) moderate pain, and three (17{\%}) severe pain. According to the classification of Frankel et al., 17 patients persisted as Frankel E and one patient presented improvement of one degree, becoming Frankel D. The mean value of Farcy s sagittal index of the injured vertebral segment was 20.67 degrees +/- 6.15 degrees (range 8 degrees -32 degrees ) during the preoperative period, 11.22 degrees +/- 8.09 degrees (range -5 degrees to 21 degrees ) during the immediate postoperative period, and 14.22 degrees +/- 7.37 degrees (range 3 degrees -25 degrees ) at late evaluation. There was a statistically significant difference between the immediate postoperative values and the preoperative and late postoperative values. The compression percentage of the fractured vertebral body ranged from 9.1 to 60 (mean 28.81 +/- 11.51) during the preoperative period, from 0 to 60 (mean: 15.59 +/- 14.49) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 8 to 60 (mean: 25.9 +/- 13.02) at late evaluation. There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative values and between the postoperative and late postoperative values. The height of the proximal intervertebral disk ranged from 6 to 14 mm (mean 8.44 +/- 2.66) during the preoperative period, from 6 to 15 mm (mean 10 +/- 2.30) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 0 to 11 mm (mean 7.22 +/- 2.55) during the late postoperative period. A significant difference was observed between the immediate postoperative values and the preoperative and late postoperative values. The height of the intervertebral disk distal to the fractured vertebra ranged from 7 to 16 mm (mean 9.94 +/- 2.64) during the preoperative period, from 5 to 18 mm (mean 11.61 +/- 3.29) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 2 to 14 mm (mean 9.72 +/- 3.17) during the late postoperative period. There was a significant difference between the immediate postoperative values and the preoperative and late postoperative values. Except for the height of the intervertebral disk proximal to the fractured vertebra, no correlation was detected between the clinical, functional and radiologic results. The results observed in the present study indicate that other, still incompletely defined parameters influence the functional result of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

Within 24 months, we treated 28 patients (average age, 41 years; range, 22-64 years; 14 women, 14 men) with acute unstable burst fractures without osteoporosis of the thoracolumbar region (n=16) and the thoracic (n=3) as well as the lumbar (n=9) spine in two stages (primary dorsal transpedicular stabilization and secondary vertebral body replacement). The complications were analyzed and the postoperative follow-up result was evaluated regarding stability, bone fusion, correction loss, pain and neurological status. One patient showed a transient irritation of the lumbosacral plexus and one patient had a superficial wound infection (complication rate, 7.1{\%}). At the follow-up examination (mean follow-up, 13 months) only in two cases a minimal loss of correction ({\textless}5 degrees ) was measured. Radiologically, 27 patients showed secure bone fusions and all patients had stability of the osteosynthesis. Most of the patients stated no or just slight pain at follow-up. Only two patients with pain to a medium degree had to take painkillers. The vertebral body replacement system Synex seems to be a good alternative for vertebral body replacement in unstable burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine since at present follow-up it shows a high rate of bone fusion and minimal loss of correction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Burst fractures generally occur due to trauma to the thoracolumbar spine. Surgery is indicated for unstable fractures. Posterior instrumentation with pedicular screws is generally proposed. In certain circumstances, hooks may be preferred due to excessive risk of insertion of the pedicular screw. The purpose of this study was to compare two posterior instrumentations, one using pedicular screws on either side of the fracture each protected by hoods and a second composed of the same pedicular screws inserted under the fracture hooks above. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve spinal specimens from human cadavers composed of segments T10 to L2 were used. Range of flexion, extension, lateral inclination, and rotation were noted on T10 up to application of 7 Nm. Spinal segments were tested first intact, then in four configurations: 1) instrumented without lesion, 2) lesion simulating burst fracture of L1 without section of the interspinous ligament, 3) and with section of the interspinous ligament, and 4) with L1 corporectomy. Finally a test to rupture was performed by applying a flexion moment up to fracture. RESULTS: Mean flexion-extension of the instrumented spine was limited compared with the intact spine for both instrumentation configurations and irrespective of the lesion. The same behavior was observed for lateral inclination with less pronounced motion with the first instrumentation. For rotation, the range of motion increased clearly with the second instrumentation and this with the first lesion while with the first instrumentation, rotation amplitude remained below that of the intact spine. There was however an increase in the vertical displacement during flexion-extension for both instrumentations. For the rupture test, the mean flexion moment at rupture was 14.4 Nm (10.6-22 Nm) with no difference between the two instrumentations. DISCUSSION: This mode simulating burst fractures of the spine appears to be reproducible and more realistic than corporectomy. Attention should be taken concerning the limits of this type of study since fractures can occur for forces as small as 10.6 Nm. Thus we observed that pedicle screw configurations and also fractures produced mean ranges of motion greater than intact segments irrespective of the type of lesion simulated. However, the net increase in motion was observed during rotation movements when hooks were used, even when they were placed only below the fracture. Putting pressure on the hooks does not prevent them from slipping along the lamina. But neither of these two configurations controls the fracture gap. A vertebral reinforcement might be necessary.},

abstract = {Anterior column reconstruction of the thoracolumbar spine by structural allograft has an increased potential for biological fusion when compared to synthetic reconstructive options. Estimation of cortical union and trabecular in-growth is, however, traditionally based on plain radiography, a technique lacking in sensitivity. A new assessment method of bony union using high-speed spiral CT imaging is proposed which reflects the gradually increasing biological stability of the construct. Grade I (complete fusion) implies cortical union of the allograft and central trabecular continuity. Grade II (partial fusion) implies cortical union of the structural allograft with partial trabecular incorporation. Grade III (unipolar pseudarthrosis) denotes superior or inferior cortical non-union of the central allograft with partial trabecular discontinuity centrally and Grade IV (bipolar pseudarthrosis) suggests both superior and inferior cortical non-union with a complete lack of central trabecular continuity. Twenty-five patients underwent anterior spinal reconstruction for a single level burst fracture between T4 and L5. At a minimum of two years follow up the subjects underwent high-speed spiral CT scanning through the reconstructed region of the thoracolumbar spine. The classification showed satisfactory interobserver (kappa score = 0.91) and intraobserver (kappa score = 0.95) reliability. The use of high-speed CT imaging in the assessment of structural allograft union may allow a more accurate assessment of union. The classification system presented allows a reproducible categorization of allograft incorporation with implications for treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that kyphoplasty is an effective treatment in painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, even with involvement of the posterior cortical wall. METHODS: Between December 2001 and May 2004, 74 consecutive patients were treated with kyphoplasty for 118 painful osteoporotic compression (38{\%}) or burst (62{\%}) fractures. Additional decompression of the spinal canal was performed in six patients, internal fixation in three. Data were collected in a prospective observational design until May 2005. The preoperative workup included neuroimaging (plain x-ray films, densitometry, short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scanning) and clinical parameters (general and neurological examinations, visual analog scale [VAS], Karnofsky Performance Scale [KPS], and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF]-36). At predefined time intervals (at discharge and 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months posttherapy) the patients were evaluated (x-ray films, neurological status, VAS, KPS, and SF-36). Kyphoplasty led to a significant reduction in kyphotic deformity (mean +/- standard error of the mean, sagittal index: preoperative 10 +/- 1 degrees, postoperative 5 +/- 1 degrees), and an improvement in pain (VAS: preoperative 70 +/- 3, postoperative 23 +/- 2), activity (KPS score: preoperative 51 +/- 3, postoperative 71 +/- 2), and mental and physical health (SF-36, mental status: preoperative 43, postoperative 58; SF-36, physical status: preoperative 24, postoperative 35). No secondary narrowing of the spinal canal by the retropulsed posterior wall was observed after the procedure. Clinical improvement was durable (mean follow up 15 +/- 1.1 months), although the VAS score secondarily increased slightly. All patients, who suffered from a compression-induced motor deficit, recovered completely during the follow-up interval. The main procedural complications consisted of one symptomatic extravertebral cement leakage (permanent monoparesis) requiring open revision, two nerve root contusions (transient radiculopathy), and one wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty is effective in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression and burst fractures, at least under medium-term conditions. The potential complication of procedure-related secondary narrowing of the spinal canal by the retropulsed posterior wall in burst fractures appears to be more of a theoretical than an actual risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between neurologic recovery and initial compromise of spinal canal and sagittal alignment has been rarely documented. This study was performed to better understand whether the degree of neurologic recovery from thoracolumbar burst fractures is affected and predicted by initial compromise of spinal canal and sagittal alignment. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients who underwent conservative or surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures between 1993 and 2001 were prospectively followed up for 3 to 10 years (average, 5.5 years). They were assessed for neurologic deficit and improvement as defined by the scoring system of ASIA, the stenotic ratio of spinal canal and kyphosis angle. RESULTS: The ASIA score in 52 patients with neurologic deficit averaged 34.0 (range, 0-50) on admission and 46.1 (range, 27-50) at final follow-up. All these patients except 2 with neurologic deficit experienced improvement with an average recovery rate of 72.7{\%} (range, 0{\%}-100{\%}). No statistically significant difference (P {\textgreater} .05) in the stenotic ratio of spinal canal or kyphotic deformity was demonstrated among the patients with no neurologic deficit, with incomplete lesions, and with complete lesions. The stenotic ratio of spinal canal or kyphosis angle was not significantly correlated with initial and final ASIA score and recovery rate (P {\textgreater} .05). CONCLUSIONS: The neurologic recovery from thoracolumbar burst fractures is not predicted by the amount of initial canal encroachment and kyphotic deformity. When deciding on the treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, both neurologic function and spinal stability should be taken into account.},

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures of L5 represent a very small proportion of all spinal injuries. The unique anatomic and biomechanical characteristics of this region protect it from traumatic injury. METHODS: Fourteen patients (n = 14) were managed for isolated burst fractures of L5 at the NSIU over a 10-year period. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry System and the NSIU Database identified our study cohort. A retrospective analysis of the medical records, radiographs, and CT scans of all patients identified was performed. Loss of anterior vertebral height, degree of kyphotic deformity, and percentage retropulsion were recorded at several phases of treatment. Follow-up clinical evaluation was performed with respect to pain status, work and recreational restrictions, along with overall patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the study cohort (n = 14), 10 patients were managed nonoperatively and 4 patients operatively. The nonoperative group showed a superior radiographic outcome at follow-up, with the nonoperative group showing a mean loss of anterior vertebral height of 15.7{\%} and a mean kyphotic deformity of 10.4 degrees. The operative group, in contrast, had a mean loss of anterior vertebral height of 19{\%} and mean kyphotic deformity of 11 degrees at follow-up. The nonoperative group additionally exhibited superior results at clinical follow-up regarding pain status, work and recreational restrictions, and overall satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series to date of isolated burst fractures of L5, we strongly advocate the nonoperative management of these injuries, particularly in cases of moderate bony deformity, minimal canal compromise, and no neurologic deficit.},

abstract = {The treatment of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial. A review of the literature showed that short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) alone led to a high incidence of implant failure and correction loss. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the outcomes of the SS- and long-segment posterior fixation (LSPF) in unstable thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12-L2) in Magerl Type A fractures. The patients were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group I included 32 patients treated by SSPF (four screws: one level above and below the fracture), and Group II included 31 patients treated by LSPF (eight screws: two levels above and below the fracture). Clinical outcomes and radiological parameters (sagittal index, SI; and canal compromise, CC) were compared according to demographic features, localizations, load-sharing classification (LSC) and Magerl subgroups, statistically. The fractures with more than 10 degrees correction loss at sagittal plane were analyzed in each group. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, LSC, SI, and CC preoperatively. The mean follow-ups were similar for both groups, 36 and 33 months, respectively. In Group II, the correction values of SI, and CC were more significant than in Group I. More than 10 degrees correction loss occurred in six of the 32 fractures in Group I and in two of the 31 patients in Group II. SSPF was found inadequate in patients with high load sharing scores. Although radiological outcomes (SI and CC remodeling) were better in Group II for all fracture types and localizations, the clinical outcomes (according to Denis functional scores) were similar except Magerl type A33 fractures. We recommend that, especially in patients, who need more mobility, with LSC point 7 or less with Magerl Type A31 and A32 fractures (LSC point 6 or less in Magerl Type A3.3) without neurological deficit, SSPF achieves adequate fixation, without implant failure and correction loss. In Magerl Type A33 fractures with LSC point 7 or more (LSC points 8-9 in Magerl Type A31 and A32) without severe neurologic deficit, LSPF is more beneficial.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature on operative and nonoperative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and no neurological deficit. METHODS: In their search of the literature, the authors identified all possible relevant studies concerning thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit. Two independent observers performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction in a blinded and objective manner for all papers identified during the search. In a synthesis of the literature, the authors obtained evidence for both operative and nonoperative treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the superiority of one approach over the other as measured using generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life scales. There is no scientific evidence linking posttraumatic kyphosis to clinical outcomes. The authors found that there is a strong need for improved clinical research methodology to be applied to this patient population.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The complexity of the vascular anatomy pertinent to the L4-5 intervertebral disc space has led to difficulties when performing the anterior approach to the lumbar spine. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the variations of the great vessels to match the imaging-documented axial anatomy with the surgical exposure. METHODS: The authors analyzed data obtained in 223 patients who had undergone mini-open anterior lumbar surgery involving the L4-5 disc. The preoperative magnetic resonance images or computed tomography scans were evaluated by examiners blinded to the surgical approach to determine the vascular configuration. All complications of the procedures were described. Two major variations of the vascular configuration were delineated according to the location of the bifurcation of the inferior vena cava. On images showing the lower margin of the L-4 vertebra, the anatomy in 182 patients (81{\%}) was classified as Type A because the inferior vena cava (IVC) was not bifurcated; in 38 patients (17{\%}) it was classified as Type B because the IVC was bifurcated. Type A could be subdivided into Types A1 and A2 according to whether the aorta was bifurcated (A2) or not (A1) on the same image. The surgical exposure used was above the bifurcations (in Type A) and below the bifurcations (in Type B). The major complications were three venous injuries, and the leading complication was sympathetic dysfunction in 14 patients, which in most cases resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Careful preoperative evaluation of the vascular anatomy is essential to conducting successful anterior lumbar surgery. The determination of an appropriate approach can contribute to a reduction of unnecessary vascular retraction and a consequent decrease in vascular complications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spinal metastatic disease occurs in up to one-third of all cancer patients. Metastasis can lead to vertebral burst fracture and consequent neurologic compromise. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at restoring vertebral stability by augmentation of weakened vertebrae with bone cement. PV is associated with a complication rate of 10{\%} in treating vertebral metastases. Tumor ablation before cement injection has been suggested to improve PV outcome in the metastatic spine. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of volumetric tumor reduction and cement augmentation in the metastatic spine and to develop a protocol for recommended cement volume to achieve sufficient restoration of intact (nonpathologic) vertebral body stability. METHODS: A biphasic parametric finite element model of an L1 spinal motion segment was developed and validated against previously collected experimental data. Using this model, 12 scenarios were simulated to represent tumor volume reductions of up to 60{\%} and cement augmentation from 1 to 8 mL. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of intact vertebral stability is possible in metastatic vertebrae after 30{\%} tumor ablation and 1 to 2 mL bone cement augmentation. A protocol was developed on the basis of the findings of this study suggesting recommended cement volume for injection as a function of remaining tumor volume after ablation. These findings may motivate refined methods of prophylactic treatment of metastatic vertebrae.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an open prospective investigation of the efficacy  of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of intravertebral pseudarthrosis. Several described intravertebral radiolucent lines-the so-called vacuum phenomenon-originated from degenerative diseases. Pain arose from intravertebral dynamic mobility and local kyphosis. METHODS: We reduced and stabilized 24 intravertebral pseudarthroses with the balloon kyphoplasty. Pain and disability showed a rapid and distinct decrease. Radiologic features and life quality were compared with respect to the different shapes of fractures type A1, A3.1, and A3.3. The follow up was 2 years. RESULTS: The patients with fractures type A3.3 were older than those of type A1 and A3.1. In pseudarthrosis of type A3.1 fractures, the kyphotic wedge could be reduced to 13 degrees and the height could be increased to 85{\%} with balloon kyphoplasty. In the A3.3 group, the wedge could be reduced to 8 degrees but the height could be increased only to 75{\%}. No restoration of deformity was achieved in fractures type A1. A long-lasting effect on pain and disability was seen only after balloon kyphoplasty of fractures type A3.1. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of intravertebral dynamic mobility with balloon kyphoplasty is useful in fractures type A3.1. In pseudarthroses type A1, the negligible reduction and only short-lasting reduction of pain stands against the costs. In pseudarthroses type A3.3, the lack of a long-lasting benefit could be the consequence of the disadvantageous shape of the vertebral body, the higher age of patients or the primary diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and significance of posterolateral fusion in  preventing failure of short-segment stabilization for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Sixty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in the study. The patients were classified into two groups (n equal to 30 in each group). In Group A, patients were treated in our hospital with short-segment instrumentation via posterolateral fusion with iliac bone. In Group B, patients were treated in other hospital with short-segment fixation without fusion. All cases came to our hospital for reexamination. There were 18 males and 12 females in Group A with a mean age of 42.3 years (range, 24 to 52 years) and 16 males and 14 females in Group B with a mean age of 41.5 years (range, 19 to 54 years). Radiographic (Cobb angle, kyphosis of the vertebral body, and sagittal index) and clinical outcomes (Low Back Outcome Score ) were analyzed after an average follow-up of 16 months. RESULTS: After operation, Cobb angle was reduced from 19.3 degrees to 3.1 degrees in Group A and from 19.1 degrees to 3.3 degrees in Group B (P{\textgreater}0.05). It was 5.9 degrees in Group A and 11. 9 degrees in Group B at the final follow-up (P{\textless}0.01). Its average loss of correction was 2.8 degree in Group A and 8.6 degrees in Group B. Average kyphosis of the vertebral body was reduced from 21.3 degrees to 6.2 degrees in Group A and from 21.7 degrees to 7.4 degrees in Group B (P{\textgreater}0.05). It was decreased to 7.9 degrees in Group A and 13.5 degrees in Group B at the final follow-up (P{\textless}0.01). Its average loss of correction was 1.7 degrees in Group A and 6.1 degrees in Group B. Sagittal index was reduced from 21.3 degrees to 3.6 degrees in Group A and from 20.5 degrees to 3.8 degrees in Group B (P{\textless}0.05). It was decreased to 5.1 degrees in Group A and 9.8 degrees in Group B at the final follow-up (P{\textless}0.01). Its average loss was 1.5 degrees in Group A and 6.0 degrees in Group B. In Group A, 73.3{\%} of patients had an excellent result based on Low Back Outcome Score system, while that in Group B was only 43.3{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Posterolateral fusion is an effective measure to prevent implant failure, and decrease loss of correction, posttraumatic kyphosis and neurological deficit during the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Short-segment fixation of thoracolumbar burst fractures without fusion obviously increases failure rate and it is not an optional procedure.},

abstract = {While a number of experiments have reported injury thresholds for the adult cervical spine in compression, the compressive failure tolerance of the child spine has not been characterized. In order to develop useful safety measures for children, the biomechanical effects of maturation must be evaluated. Hence, this study examined the effects of spinal development on the compressive mechanics of the cervical spine. An animal model was used due to the lack of human tissues in the pediatric age range. Twenty-two fresh cadaveric baboon cervical spines (all male) were dissected into two functional spinal unit segments: Occiput-C2, C3-C5, C6-T1. The specimens ranged in age from 1 to 30-human equivalent years based upon radiographic assessment of their skeletal maturity. Dynamic (1.0-m/sec) haversine displacement inputs up to 70{\%} strain were imparted on each specimen and the resulting loads were recorded. Significant increases in the compressive failure load were observed with increased maturation of the spinal tissues (ANOVA, p = 0.003). Differences were also observed between the spinal levels examined. The lower cervical spine, C6-T1, had the smallest failure load for specimens greater than 8-human-equivalent years, while the upper cervical spine was the most susceptible to injury at less than 8-human-equivalent years. The compressive failures generated are consistent with those observed clinically, consisting of primarily burst fractures and physis (growth plate) failures. These data clearly suggest that spinal compressive tolerance is directly related to maturation. Therefore, through scaling, these data may provide tolerance values applicable to anthropomorphic test dummies and computational models aimed at injury prevention for the pediatric occupant.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-one intact human lumbar vertebral bodies (L3 and L4) were used to determine the changes in measured intraosseous pressure for 2 volumetric flow rates and to calculate hydraulic resistance in both cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in hydraulic resistance in intact vertebral bodies under different rates of flow. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Hydraulic resistance has been implicated in the creation of high-speed vertebral injuries, such as burst fracture, but no previous study has measured hydraulic resistance under high-speed loading conditions. Previous work in whole bone preparations showed that hydraulic resistance was constant under low-speed conditions. The authors hypothesized that: (1) measured pressure would increase with increasing input flow rates, and (2) hydraulic resistance would remain constant at increased input flow rates. METHODS: Using 2 input velocity conditions (10 mm/s and 2500 mm/s), resultant pressures were measured and hydraulic resistance calculated. Trabecular architecture was determined using micro-computerized tomography after testing. RESULTS: Measured pressure increased with increasing input flow rates. However, average hydraulic resistance decreased significantly when comparing low-speed (3.40 +/- 1.58kPa*s/mL) and high-speed (0.16 +/- 0.08kPa*s/mL) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Current hydraulic resistance results contradict previous findings. The observed decrease in hydraulic resistance suggests that, during high-speed injury events, marrow flow may damage the trabeculae and thereby weaken the vertebra.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The decision on the surgical approach in the operative treatment of the fractures of thoracolumbar spine is possible only by following a detailed classification. However, the application of the classification systems is not reliable without a complex imagination of the bony and fibrous structures involved into the fracture. Pre-op investigation should include x-rays, CT-scans and MRI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patient series consists of 21 females and 43 males treated surgically for the unstable thoracolumbar fracture during 2001. The average age was 43 years. Patients suffering form osteoporosis, fresh spinal cord injury and multiple spine fractures were excluded. All fractures were examined by plain x-rays, CT-scans and MRI and classified according the AO-ASIF classification system. In patients with A-type fractures the single anterior approach was used. Patients with B- or C-type of fracture were operated by the posterior approach. These fractures were complementary classified according to the Load-sharing classification and those with 6 or more points were additionally operated also from the front. Patients were divided into the three groups: the anterior approach (22 pts), the combined procedure (22 pts) and the posterior approach (20 pts). In the third group, the hardware was removed after 15 months on average. No posterolateral fusion was carried out. Minimum follow-up was 22 months. RESULTS: No implant failure was found in any patient. No significant loss of correction was found in the first and the second group. The loss of correction in the third group was 3.1 degree on average. CONCLUSION: Overall graphical imagination of the thoracolumbar fractures (including MRI) is essential for their classification. The classification helps to choose the optimum surgical approach. The approach related to the fracture classification prevents the treatment failure.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Computed tomography aided evaluation of spinal decompression by ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning, ligamentotaxis, and remodeling after thoracolumbar burst fractures. OBJECTIVES: To determine the necessity of spinal canal widening by ultrasound-guided fracture repositioning for fractures with and without neurologic deficit. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning is an alternative new approach. Reports have varied concerning ligamentotaxis and remodeling. METHODS: Computed tomography aided planimetry of the spinal canal (64 consecutive burst fractures) and neurologic evaluation by Frankel grades. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided spinal fracture repositioning (n = 37) reduced the stenosis of the spinal canal area from 45{\%} before surgery to 20{\%} after surgery of the estimated original area. Fifteen patients had a primary neurologic deficit, which improved markedly in 11 cases after treatment. Patients with neurologic symptoms had a greater preoperative spinal stenosis than those without. No correlation was seen between the degree of pretreatment spinal stenosis, fracture type, and severity of the neurologic deficit. Ligamentotaxis (n = 27) reduced the stenosis from 30{\%} before surgery to 18{\%} after surgery and remodeling (n = 11) from 25{\%} after surgery to 13{\%} after metal removal. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided fracture repositioning is an efficient method for spinal canal decompression of burst fractures with neurologic symptoms. The marked degree of widening of the spinal canal due to the effects of ligamentotaxis and remodeling may render the reposition of retropulsed fragments unnecessary in cases of fractures without a neurologic deficit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chance-type fractures are subtle unstable injuries that are often associated with intraabdominal injuries. CT-based observations made during routine interpretations revealed involvement of a burst component to this fracture pattern and a clue on the transaxial images to its presence. The purpose of this review was to determine how often these features occurred in a retrospective study of a large sample because these findings influence diagnosis and management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients identified from the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center trauma registry and IDXRad system diagnosed with flexion-distraction injuries of the thoracolumbar spine over an 8-year period was performed. Three trauma radiologists assessed the admission spinal radiographs, CT studies with multiplanar images, and available MRI examinations. Imaging findings were confirmed by consensus. Abdominopelvic CT studies and surgical reports were reviewed for evidence and type of intraabdominal injury. A literature review of previous similar series was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were identified for inclusion in the study. Associated intraabdominal injury occurred in 40{\%} and most commonly involved the bowel and mesentery. A close examination of the fracture patterns on CT revealed that a burst-type fracture with posterior cortex buckling or retropulsion was a common finding (48{\%}). Also, serial transaxial CT images often (76{\%}) showed a gradual loss of definition of the pedicles that we refer to as the "dissolving pedicle" sign. The study showed that the horizontally oriented fracture planes through the posterior elements can often be recognized radiographically, but these fractures can be very subtle. CONCLUSION: Intraabdominal injuries occurred in 40{\%} of flexion-distraction thoracolumbar fractures in our study cohort, which is slightly lower than previously reported. About half of the patients with this injury displayed a burst-type component that could have a significant influence on surgical management. The dissolving pedicle sign can assist in recognition of this often subtle injury on transaxial CT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to report experience gained over three years of the use of a protocol for patient selection and timing of operation for acute thoracic and lumbar fractures. METHOD: At admission, all patients underwent neurological and imaging exams. All patients with a spinal cord lesion scored as ASIA A at any level inferior to T10 and as ASIA B, C or D at any level, were categorized as emergency and operated on within eight hours from trauma. ASIA A cases in the T1-T10 tract and ASIA E cases at any level were treated in the ordinary operative work schedule. FINDINGS: Ninety-four patients with surgically treated lumbar or thoracic fractures took part in this study. On the imaging studies, 12 patients were classified as A, 50 as B and 32 as C following the AO classification. At the neurological exam, 39 patients were scored as ASIA A, nine as B, six as C, two as D and 38 as E. At follow-up, of the 39 patients scored as ASIA A, 13 (33{\%}) improved at least one grade and of the 17 scored as ASIA B, C or D, 11 (64.7{\%}) improved. None of the 38 patients scored as ASIA E deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that the strategy in the protocol was safe and followed by satisfactory rates of neurological outcome. Larger prospective studies, preferably randomized, are needed to establish definitively its place in the management of patients with spinal injury.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Plexin A2 (PLXNA2) is a receptor that recognizes secreted or membrane-bound semaphorin 3A, which is implicated in neural regulation of bone metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we identified 48 genetic polymorphisms in PLXNA2 by resequencing, and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for further investigation into their potential involvement in osteoporosis in a postmenopausal population (n=560). RESULTS: Two SNPs, +14G{\textgreater}A (Gln5Arg) and +183429C{\textgreater}T (Tyr1621Tyr), and Block1-ht2 were associated with risk of vertebral fracture (p=0.01-0.05), and three SNPs, +799G{\textgreater}A (Ala267Thr), +135391G{\textgreater}A, and +190531G{\textgreater}C, were associated with bone mineral density at various femur sites (p=0.003-0.03). Particularly, the minor allele of +14G{\textgreater}A was associated with a protective effect on vertebral fracture and higher lumbar bone mineral density, suggesting that +14G{\textgreater}A may be a useful marker for osteoporosis and its related fracture. CONCLUSION: These results provide, for the first time, evidence supporting the association of PLXNA2 with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors undertook a retrospective cohort study of patients with T11-L2 thoracolumbar burst fractures who underwent decompression and the placement of instrumentation via the anterolateral or posterior approach. METHODS: There were 63 thoracolumbar burst fractures in 45 male and 18 female patients. The instrumentation was placed posteriorly in 25 patients and anterolaterally in 38. The mean follow-up duration after discharge from the hospital was 1.8 years (range 6 months-8 years). The mean preoperative Frankel scores in the anterolateral and posterior groups were 3.7 +/- 1.1 and 3.5 +/- 1.4, respectively (p = 0.4155). Preoperative angular deformity in the anterolateral and posterior groups measured 11.9 +/- 9.7 and 4.1 +/- 7.1 degrees, respectively (p = 0.0007). Postoperatively, angular deformity had been corrected to 2.0 +/- 7.9 and 3.4 +/- 7.5 degrees in both groups, respectively (p = 0.565). The follow-up Frankel scores had improved to 4.2 +/- 0.8 and 4.0 +/- 1.4 (p = 0.461). At the latest follow-up examination, angular deformity had progressed to 4.5 +/- 9.3 degrees in the anterolateral group and to 9.8 +/- 9.4 degrees in the posterior group (p = 0.024). dollar 18,270 +/- 6980), there was no intergroup difference in total cost of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Rigid guidelines for the selection of anterior or posterior approaches are lacking. Evaluation of the authors' results and those of others shows that angular deformity is more successfully corrected and maintained when the anterior approach is used.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the safety, efficacy, and complication rate associated with the anterior approach in the use of a new titanium mesh interbody fusion cage for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. The experience with this technique is compared with the senior authors' (C.S., R.W., and M.S.) previously published results in the management of patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Between 1996 and 1999, 21 patients with unstable thoracolumbar (T12-L3) burst fractures underwent an anterolateral decompressive procedure in which a titanium cage and Kaneda device were used. Eleven of the 21 patients had sustained a neurological deficit, and all patients improved at least one Frankel grade (average 1.2 grades). There was improvement in outcome in terms of blood loss, correction of kyphosis, and pain, as measured on the Denis Pain and Work Scale, in our current group of patients treated via an anterior approach when compared with the results in those who underwent a posterior approach. In our current study the anterior approach was demonstrated to be a safe and effective technique for the management of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. It offers superior results compared with the posterior approach. The addition of the new titanium mesh interbody cage to our previous anterior technique allows the patient's own bone to be harvested from the corpectomy site and used as a substrate for fusion, thereby obviating the need for iliac crest harvest. The use of the cage in association with the Kaneda device allows for improved correction of kyphosis and restoration of normal sagittal alignment in addition to improved functional outcomes.},

abstract = {The authors report their experience with 42 patients in whom anterior lumbar fusion was performed using titanium cages as a versatile adjunct to treat a wide variety of spinal deformity and pathological conditions. These conditions included congenital, degenerative, iatrogenic, infectious, traumatic, and malignant disorders of the thoracolumbar spine. Fusion rates and complications are compared with data previously reported in the literature. Between July 1996 and July 1999 the senior authors (C.I.S., R.P.N., and M.J.R.) treated 42 patients by means of a transabdominal extraperitoneal (13 cases) or an anterolateral extraperitoneal approach (29 cases), 51 vertebral levels were fused using titanium cages packed with autologous bone. All vertebrectomies (27 cases) were reconstructed using a Miami Moss titanium mesh cage and Kaneda instrumentation. Interbody fusion (15 cases) was performed with either the BAK titanium threaded interbody cage (in 13 patients) or a Miami Moss titanium mesh cage (in two patients). The average follow-up period was 14.3 months. Seventeen patients had sustained a thoracolumbar burst fracture, 12 patients presented with degenerative spinal disorders, six with metastatic tumor, four with spinal deformity (one congenital and three iatrogenic), and three patients presented with spinal infections. In five patients anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) was supplemented with posterior segmental fixation at the time of the initial procedure. Of the 51 vertebral levels treated, solid arthrodesis was achieved in 49, a 96{\%} fusion rate. One case of pseudarthrosis occurred in the group treated with BAK cages; the diagnosis was made based on the patient's continued mechanical back pain after undergoing L4-5 ALIF. The patient was treated with supplemental posterior fixation, and successful fusion occurred uneventfully with resolution of her back pain. In the group in which vertebrectomy was performed there was one case of fusion failure in a patient with metastatic breast cancer who had undergone an L-3 corpectomy with placement of a mesh cage. Although her back pain was immediately resolved, she died of systemic disease 3 months after surgery and before fusion could occur. Complications related to the anterior approach included two vascular injuries (two left common iliac vein lacerations); one injury to the sympathetic plexus; one case of superficial phlebitis; two cases of prolonged ileus (greater than 48 hours postoperatively); one anterior femoral cutaneous nerve palsy; and one superficial wound infection. No deaths were directly related to the surgical procedure. There were no cases of dural laceration and no nerve root injury. There were no cases of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, retrograde ejaculation, abdominal hernia, bowel or ureteral injury, or deep wound infection. Fusion-related complications included an iliac crest hematoma and prolonged donor-site pain in one patient. There were no complications related to placement or migration of the cages, but there was one case of screw fracture of the Kaneda device that did not require revision. The authors conclude that anterior lumbar fusion performed using titanium interbody or mesh cages, packed with autologous bone, is an effective, safe method to achieve fusion in a wide variety of pathological conditions of the thoracolumbar spine. The fusion rate of 96{\%} compares favorably with results reported in the literature. The complication rate mirrors the low morbidity rate associated with the anterior approach. A detailed study of clinical outcomes is in progress. Patient selection and strategies for avoiding complication are discussed.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Review the association between injury severity, narrowing of the spinal canal, and neurologic deficit in thoracolumbar burst fractures. OBJECTIVE: To determine which variable has a stronger association with neurologic deficit: spinal canal compromise or injury severity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Literature has not reached a consensus regarding the cause of neurologic deficits in these fractures. Some believe it to be the spinal canal compromise and others the energy of trauma. METHODS: A review of the clinical data and axial computerized tomography of 184 patients was performed. The injury severity was determined by subtracting neurologic data from the Injury Severity Score and New Injury Severity Score (ISSM and NISSM) to avoid the bias of overestimating neurologic lesions. RESULTS: Patients with neurologic deficit presented higher canal compromise (52{\%} vs. 34{\%}), higher Injury Severity Score (24 vs. 11), New Injury Severity Score (26 vs. 13), ISSM (10 vs. 7), and NISSM (11 vs. 8, respectively). A positive correlation was found among these scores and the spinal canal compromise (P {\textless} 0.005; r {\textless} 0.35). In the current methodology, logistic regression proved narrowing of the spinal canal to be the only independent variable associated with neurologic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Narrowing of the spinal canal has a stronger association with neurologic deficit than injury severity in thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

Generally, the anterior approaches are best used at the thoracolumbar junction, posterior approaches are ideal for low lumbar injuries and lumbar injuries that result in complete spinal cord injuries,and anteroposterior surgeries typically are reserved for highly unstable fracture subluxations.

The mean computed tomography-measured preoperative spinal canal compromise was 48.3{\%} (range 8-92{\%}), and the mean vertebral body height loss was 39.4{\%}. The mean preoperative kyphotic deformity of 14.9 degrees improved to 4.6 degrees at the final follow-up examination. Although this angulation had increased a mean of 1.8 degrees during the follow-up period, the extent of correction was still significant compared with the preoperative angulation (p {\textless} 0.01).

abstract = {Operative management of a thoracolumbar burst fracture varies according to many factors. Fracture morphology, neurologic status, and surgeon preference play major roles in deciding upon anterior, posterior, or combined approaches. Optimizing neural decompression while providing stable internal fixation over the least number of spinal segments is the goal. Short-segment constructs via a single-stage approach (anterior versus posterior) have become viable options with advances in instrumentation and techniques. This study compares anterior-only fixation utilizing a corpectomy strut graft and a modern thoracolumbar plating system with a posterior-only construct using pedicle screws and load sharing hooks for the treatment of unstable burst fractures. Functional outcome and sagittal plane restoration and maintenance of sagittal plane alignment were evaluated. Fifty-three patients with unstable burst fractures were assessed with 40 undergoing an anterior-only construct and 13 having a short-segment posterior-only construct. The posterior-only group had no hardware failures; however, the loss of sagittal plane correction averaged 8.1 degrees, whereas the anterior-only group averaged only a 1.8-degree increase in sagittal plane kyphosis. Both techniques resulted in statistically significant initial improvement in sagittal alignment; however, the posterior short-segment group lost this statistical significance at follow-up whereas the anterior-only group continued to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in sagittal alignment at follow-up compared to preoperative measurements.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vertebrae with lytic metastases have an elevated risk of burst fracture and resultant neurologic compromise. Prophylactic vertebroplasty has the potential to reduce pain and the risk of burst fracture in the metastatic spine. The purpose of this study was to quantify the ability of vertebroplasty to stabilize metastatically involved vertebrae against the risk of burst fracture initiation with a standardized model of vertebral metastases. METHODS: Metastases were simulated in eight fresh-frozen cadaveric thoracolumbar spinal motion segments by removing a central core of trabecular bone and filling the defect with tumor tissue. Specimens were tested under a physiologic level of axial compression, intact, with a simulated tumor and post-vertebroplasty, and ultimately tested to failure. Axial load induced canal narrowing (CN) was used as a measure of the risk of burst fracture initiation. Following testing, vertebrae were axially sectioned to visualize cement fill. RESULTS: Vertebrae with simulated metastases exhibited significantly higher CN than intact specimens (227{\%}+/-109{\%}; P{\textless}0.05). Post vertebroplasty, three vertebrae exhibited reduced CN compared with the simulated tumor configuration, whereas the other five had increased CN. Specimens with reduced CN were found to have cement posterior to the tumor, whereas specimens with an increase in CN had cement anterior and lateral to the tumor only. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective in decreasing CN if tumor is surrounded posteriorly with cement. However, injecting cement into the posterior third of the vertebral body is risky due to potential extravasation into the canal. CONCLUSION: Future work aimed at improving cement fill is necessary for safe and consistent stabilization of the metastatic spine with vertebroplasty.},

abstract = {The most common pattern among thoracolumbar burst fractures involves failure of the superior vertebra end-plate. There have been many biomechanical studies of thoracolumbar burst fractures, but the biomechanics related to the internal architecture of thoracolumbar vertebrae has been rarely documented. The objective of this study was to test the hypotheses that distribution of the bone mineral density (BMD) of the thoracolumbar spine is related to the stress concentration in this region and therefore, supports the pattern of burst fractures that occur most commonly. We measured spinal BMD of the first lumbar vertebra in 22 individuals using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) in three levels. At each level, the BMD for the trabecular compartment was determined from each of six sites and from one site within each pedicle. Thus the trabecular density was measured at a total of 20 sites for each person. The highest average QCT BMD was in the pedicle (sites 13 and 14), whereas the BMD was abruptly decreased at the posterior part of the vertebral body near the pedicles. The results of the study indicate that stress concentration of the spine related to the regional variation in vertebral bone density may be implicated in the biomechanical mechanism underlying thoracolumbar burst fractures. This finding may be correlated with the injury mechanism of thoracolumbar burst fractures and of clinical significance.},

abstract = {Thirty-six consecutive patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine and with a fractured posterior vertebral surface dislocated into the spinal canal without neurological symptoms were treated with the AO internal fixator. Computed tomography-aided planimetry of the spinal canal was undertaken preoperatively and within 1 week postoperatively to elucidate the effect of kyphosis correction and distraction on spinal canal widening (ligamentotaxis). The stenosis of the spinal canal area (SCA) was reduced from 29{\%} preoperatively to 19{\%} postoperatively (+10{\%}) of the estimated original area, and the stenosis of the mid-sagittal diameter (MSD) reduced from 31 to 23{\%} (+8{\%}). The widening of the SCA was greater at the level of L1/L2 (+13{\%}) than at L3/L4 (+6{\%}). High preoperative canal compromise was associated with greater absolute spinal canal widening. Large trapezoid-shaped fragments resisted reduction by ligamentotaxis. Even though the effect of ligamentotaxis after operative treatment with the internal fixator was proven, a certain stenosis of the spinal canal remains in most cases. Especially for patients with fracture-related neurological symptoms, ligamentotaxis alone does not seem sufficient for the requested spinal decompression. Even an exact analysis of preoperative CT scans under consideration of the fracture level will not always allow an exact prognosis of the expected effect of ligamentotaxis.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Review of human cadaveric and in vivo animal studies and clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To develop less invasive surgical techniques for reconstruction of the anterior column in thoracolumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Persistent central endplate depression can cause anterior column insufficiency after posterior surgery for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Reduction of the central endplate followed by intravertebral cement augmentation could restore weight-bearing capacity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In human cadaveric burst fracture models, balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and vertebroplasty techniques have been investigated in terms of their safety and biomechanical properties. The histologic properties of different cement polymers were studied in an animal vertebral body and endplate defect model. In addition, the clinical outcome of percutaneous cement augmentation in the setting of a burst fracture examining the BAER technique and vertebroplasty with adjunctive posterior pedicle screw fixation is reviewed. RESULTS: These techniques have proven to be safe and effective, although cement leakage outside the confines of the vertebral body may occur. Calcium phosphate cements are preferable over methylmethacrylate because of their in vivo histologic properties. Using the BAER technique and posterior pedicular fixation, anterior vertebral height restoration is possible. Following balloon removal, some loss of fracture height restoration is observed. Further loss of vertebral height reduction was not observed following cement curing clinically. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that less invasive anterior vertebral reconstruction using percutaneous cement augmentation techniques is feasible following traumatic vertebral fractures.},

abstract = {Complications of transpedicular stabilizations of thoraco-lumbar burst fractures  are presented on the basis of literature review and own experiences. Unstable thoraco-lumbar burst fractures create the most difficult biomechanical conditions for a stabilizer. A literature review was done to estimate the effectiveness of vertebral body height restoration and its maintenance, the effectiveness of transpedicular grafting, the fusion rate and the implant-related complications rate. Transpedicular stabilization systems demonstrate a marked stiffness in all directions which is greater than in the case of other posterior stabilization systems. During the postero-lateral spondylodesis the transpedicular stabilizer is gradually unburdened but it is still loaded even after the completion of the bone fusion. A support of the anterior spinal column markedly diminishes the loads of the stabilizer and improves the segmental stability. Long-term follow-up studies of transpedicularly stabilized burst fractures reveal a deterioration of primarily good corrections. In some cases the correction returns to the level from before the operation in spite of transpedicular bone grafting. The implant-related complications rate (screw or rod breakages and a loss of interconnections) reaches up to 28 {\%} of cases. In order to improve the anterior column stability and limit late kyphotization, as well as avoid implant-related complications, some authors additionally recommend performing a posterior interbody fusion (PLIF) or an anterior corpectomy with stabilization. Posterior transpedicular stabilization of thoraco-lumbar burst fractures does not provide a complete stabilization of the anterior spinal column, which results in a recurrence of spine kyphotization and implant-related complications. In selected cases, the application of an additional anterior column support markedly relieves the transpedicular fixator and reduces the pseudoarthrosis rate, late kyphotization and implant-related complications simultaneously.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Although poor paraspinal muscle endurance has been associated with less  quadriceps activation (QA) in persons with a history of low back pain, no authors have addressed the acute neuromuscular response after lumbar paraspinal fatiguing exercise. OBJECTIVE: To compare QA after lumbar paraspinal fatiguing exercise in healthy individuals and those with a history of low back pain. DESIGN: A 2 x 4 repeated-measures, time-series design. SETTING: Exercise and Sport Injury Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen volunteers participated (9 males, 7 females; 8 controls and 8 with a history of low back pain; age = 24.1 +/- 3.1 years, height = 173.4 +/- 7.1 cm, mass = 72.4 +/- 12.1 kg). INTERVENTION(S): Subjects performed 3 sets of isometric lumbar paraspinal fatiguing muscle contractions. Exercise sets continued until the desired shift in lumbar paraspinal electromyographic median power frequency was observed. Baseline QA was compared with QA after each exercise set. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): An electric burst was superimposed while subjects performed a maximal quadriceps contraction. We used the central activation ratio to calculate QA = (F(MVIC)/[F(MVIC) + F(Burst)])* 100, where F = force and MVIC = maximal voluntary isometric contractions. Quadriceps electromyographic activity was collected at the same time as QA measurements to permit calculation of median frequency during MVIC. RESULTS: Average QA decreased from baseline (87.4{\%} +/- 8.2{\%}) after the first (84.5{\%} +/- 10.5{\%}), second (81.4{\%} +/- 11.0{\%}), and third (78.2{\%} +/- 12.7{\%}) fatiguing exercise sets. On average, the group with a history of low back pain showed significantly more QA than controls. No significant change in quadriceps median frequency was noted during the quadriceps MVICs. CONCLUSIONS: The quadriceps muscle group was inhibited after lumbar paraspinal fatiguing exercise in the absence of quadriceps fatigue. This effect may be different for people with a history of low back pain compared with healthy controls.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of the treatment of acute thoracolumbar burst fractures by transpedicular hydroxyapatite grafting following indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, the major problem after posterior correction and instrumentation is failure to support the anterior spinal column, leading to the loss of correction of kyphosis and instrumentation breakage. METHODS: There were 15 consecutive patients who had thoracolumbar burst fractures and associated incomplete neurologic deficit. They underwent surgery within 4 days of admission, had their implants removed within 1 year, and were prospectively followed for at least 2 years. Following indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation, transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite grafting to the fractured vertebrae was performed. Median operating time was 130 minutes, and median blood loss was 155 g. RESULTS: The neurologic function of all 15 patients improved by at least 1 American Spine Injury Association grade, with 9 (60{\%}) having complete neurologic recovery. Sagittal alignment was improved from a median preoperative kyphosis of 20 degrees to -1 degrees (lordosis) by surgery but was found to have slightly deteriorated to 1 degrees at final follow-up observation. Computerized tomography showed a median spinal canal narrowing of 64{\%}, 22{\%}, and 11{\%}, respectively. There were no instances of instrumentation failure. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior indirect reduction, transpedicular hydroxyapatite grafting, and pedicle screw fixation could provide reliable neurologic improvement in patients with incomplete neurologic deficit, and could prevent the development of kyphosis. This technique does not require fusion to a segment, thereby preserves thoracolumbar motion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracoscopic Nuss operation of funnel chest is increasingly performed. However, it has a high rate of complications. This study developed some modifications to facilitate Nuss operations with the intention of reducing several major complications. METHODS: Patients who presented for surgical repair of pectus excavatum from July 2003 through June 2004 had a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan, pulmonary function tests, and cardiac echo before and two months after the modified Nuss operation. The following modifications of the standard Nuss procedure were implemented: (1) One small subxyphoid incision was made to guide the plate implantation and to decrease cardiopulmonary complications. (2) Thoracic muscles were dissected off the ribs to provide muscle pockets. (3) Shorter thick stainless-steel AO bars were selected to avoid thoracic outlet syndrome and restriction. (4) The bars were fixed to adjacent ribs by 4-0 stainless steel wires into the submuscular pockets. (5) No thoracoscope routinely used. (6) No chest tubes were placed to decrease chest pain or for cosmetic purposes. RESULTS: 15 patients aged between 4 and 32 years (mean, 18.6 +/- 7.8) underwent evaluation. Preoperative CT index was 4.14 +/- 0.86. The average operating time was 95.7 +/- 27.0 min. There was no bar dislocation, prolonged pain, or neuralgia. Echocardiography showed no pericarditis and no pneumothorax occurred after placement of the intrathoracic bar. CONCLUSION: A small subxiphoid incision makes bar implantation easier and has reduced the incidence of major complications in this early experience with 15 patients.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 307 acetabulum fracture patients over 5 years, and evaluated this cohort for concomitant spine injuries. Patient and injury demographics, spine and neurologic injury and delay in diagnosis were examined. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 275 (90{\%}) of the cohort, and 55 spine injuries (54 fractures and 1 traumatic disc herniation) were identified in 34 patients. Thus, the incidence of concomitant acetabulum and spine fractures was approximately 13{\%} (34 of 275). Four percent of the patients sustained significant thoracolumbar fractures (burst, flexion-distraction, or dislocation). An average 8.6-day delay in diagnosis occurred in three spine fracture patients. One suffered progressive neurologic injury. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential that the traumatologists have a high index of suspicion for spine injury, particularly thoracolumbar injury in patients who sustain fractures of the acetabulum. We recommend early thoracolumbar computed tomography imaging in patients with fractures of the acetabulum if plain radiographs are not possible or inadequate.},

METHODS: The study included 372 patients (264 men, 108 women; mean age 30.4 years; range 18 to 65 years) who were treated for vertebra fractures from 1988 to 2003. Evaluations included demographic features of patients, trauma mechanisms, fracture levels and types, treatment modalities, and associated injuries. The types of fractures were assessed according to the Denis classification. RESULTS: The types of fractures were classified as follows: compression fractures (n=212, 57.0{\%}), burst fractures (n=146, 39.3{\%}), seat belt-induced fractures (n=8, 2.2{\%}), and fracture-dislocations (n=6, 1.6{\%}). Involvement was at one level in 290 patients (77.9{\%}), two levels in 61 patients (16.4{\%}), three levels in 15 patients (4.0{\%}), and four levels in six patients (1.6{\%}). The most common localization was the thoracolumbar spine (transition zone) with 275 fractures (57.2{\%}). The causes of fractures were fall from height in 211 patients (56.7{\%}), traffic accidents in 145 patients (39.0{\%}), and direct trauma in 16 patients (4.3{\%}). Associated fractures were detected in 110 patients (29.6{\%}), the most common being calcaneus fractures in 35 patients (9.4{\%}). Apart from orthopedic problems, 38 patients (10.2{\%}) had other organ injuries and/or head trauma. Treatment was conservative in 302 patients (81.2{\%}) and surgical in 70 patients (18.8{\%}). CONCLUSION: Every patient presenting after a high-energy trauma should be regarded as having a vertebra fracture until proven otherwise. When a vertebra fracture is detected, investigation should be extended for involvement at other levels and associated injuries.},

abstract = {Although a metabolic role for endothelium in toxic injury has been well established, a similar role has not been as thoroughly explored for the vascular media. In this study two forms of vascular medial involvement in toxic injury are examined. Early atherosclerotic plaques are studied by immunohistochemistry for an a class glutathione-S-transferase (GST) isozyme known as hGSTA4-4, which has preferential metabolic activity for a, ss -unsaturated aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, especially 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. Findings in human plaque indicate that hGST A4-4 is highly upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the plaque and in the medial VSMCs underlying plaque. Endothelial cells, while not expressing hGST A4-4 distant from plaques, were found to express the isozyme in cytoplasm overlying plaque. In a series of second experiments, we illustrate a developmental model of dissecting aortic aneurysm (DAA) obtained by administering semicarbazide, an inhibitor of the little-studied VSMC enzyme semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), to pregnant rats during the last trimester of development. Newborn rats consistently developed DAA which is characterized by splitting of media of ascending thoracic aorta and extensive blood collections surrounding the vessel. These experimental examples emphasize the potential role of the media in toxic insults to blood vessels. Also, the potential importance of toxic injury to developing blood vessels by in utero exposure to xenobiotic substances is illustrated.},

Lamina fractures may be complete or of the greenstick type. Dural tears and nerve root entrapment may accompany these lamina fractures. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of dural tear in patients who had lumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures and the importance of these lamina fractures when choosing the optimum treatment. Twenty-six patients with 28 lumbar burst fractures were treated from 1995 through 2002. The average follow-up was 60 months (range 32-110 months). The male to female ratio was 21:5 and the mean age was 37 years (17-64). Dural tear was detected in seven (25{\%}) out of 28 burst fractures. The functional outcome of the entire study group was assessed using the Smiley-Webster Scale. Good to excellent results were obtained in 24 (92{\%}) of 26 patients. Lumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures occur mostly in the L2-L4 area. In the surgical treatment, any reduction manoeuvre will close the fracture and crush the entrapped neural elements. Therefore, it may be better to explore the greenstick lamina fracture whether there is any neural entrapment or not, before any reduction manoeuvre is attempted.},

abstract = {The mechanical integrity of vertebral bone is compromised when metastatic cancer  cells migrate to the spine, rendering it susceptible to burst fracture under physiologic loading. Risk of burst fracture has been shown to be dependent on the magnitude of the applied load, however limited work has been conducted to determine the effect of load type on the stability of the metastatic spine. The objective of this study was to use biphasic finite element modeling to evaluate the effect of multiple loading conditions on a metastatically-involved thoracic spinal motion segment. Fifteen loading scenarios were analyzed, including axial compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending, torsion, and combined loads. Additional analyses were conducted to assess the impact of the ribcage on the stability of the thoracic spine. Results demonstrate that axial loading is the predominant load type leading to increased risk of burst fracture initiation, while rotational loading led to only moderate increases in risk. Inclusion of the ribcage was found to reduce the potential for burst fracture by 27{\%}. These findings are important in developing a more comprehensive understanding of burst fracture mechanics and in directing future modeling efforts. The results in this study may also be useful in advising less harmful activities for patients affected by lytic spinal metastases.},

abstract = {The vertebral fracture patterns of AO classification have been established historically via radiograph and computed tomography analysis, achieving modest reproducibility values. The authors hypothesize that magnetic resonance imaging may improve reliability because it better indicates posterior ligamentous complex damage. They conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective recruited cohort of patients using radiographs and magnetic resonance images with fat saturation sequences to classify 37 traumatic vertebral fractures. Five spine surgeons, 2 orthopedic residents, 2 musculoskeletal radiologists, and 2 radiodiagnosis residents classified the morphological pattern of each fracture per AO classification in 2 separate sessions that occurred 6 weeks apart. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility for AO classification types A, B, and C were assessed using the kappa test (pairwise method), and standard error was assessed using the jackknife method. Quantitative comparisons were performed using the Student's t test, and the kappas were performed using normal approximation. Mean interobserver agreement was kappa=0.53 and 0.47 for the first and second sessions, respectively, for all evaluators. Greater interobserver agreement was observed between the senior doctors (kappa=0.59 and 0.54 for the first and second sessions, respectively) vs residents (kappa=0.45 and 0.31 for the first and second sessions, respectively) (P=.02) and between orthopedic surgeons vs radiologists (kappa=0.71 vs 0.48, respectively) (P=.008). Mean intraobserver agreement was kappa=0.58 (range, 0.38-0.76). Evaluators more familiar with the classification obtained higher kappas. Magnetic resonance imaging offers moderate reproducibility in assessing vertebral fractures pursuant to AO classification, and results are slightly better than those reported with computed tomography. Reliability increases in the hands of experiened spine surgeons and improves with greater familiarization with the classification.},

We identified 50 patients who underwent revision spinal fusion surgery with a minimum of 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 4 years (range, 3-8.3 years). The diagnosis at index surgery was idiopathic scoliosis in 18 patients, congenital scoliosis in 13, neuromuscular scoliosis in 13, tumor and spinal arteriovenous malformation in 4, burst fracture in thoracic spine in 1, and Scheuermann kyphosis in 1. The primary surgeries were 1 hemi epiphysiodesis, 3 anterior spinal fusions, 4 posterior decompressions, 8 combined anterior and posterior spinal fusions, and 34 posterior spinal fusions. A total of 16 patients had pseudarthrosis, 12 decompensation, 11 progressive kyphosis, 8 crankshaft phenomenon, 2 infections, and 1 junctional degeneration. All 50 reoperations included spinal instrumentation and fusion. The revision surgeries were 2 anterior spinal fusions, 14 posterior fusions, and 34 combined anterior and posterior spinal fusions. Spine arthrodesis was obtained in 98{\%} of patients (49 of 50) and complications occurred in 14{\%} of patients (7 of 50). The Scoliosis Research Society Patient Questionnaire outcomes at the latest follow-up were as follows: total 3.95, function 3.88, pain 3.83, self-image 3.98, and mental health 4.04. CONCLUSION: Pseudarthrosis was the most common indication for revision surgery, and bony union was achieved in 98{\%} with revision surgery. Despite the complications, pediatric revision spine surgery can achieve successful outcomes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Type B3 thoracic and lumbar fractures are often found in spines with previous hyperossification processes such as ankylosing spondylarthritis (AS) or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). They occur most frequently due to high-energy trauma in a healthy spine and as fall-related domestic injury in a spine affected by hyperossification. Generally, they are less frequent than type B3 cervical spine fractures. In this retrospective study involving two centres, the incidence of these fractures, their characterisation, therapy and complications associated with them were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2003 and March 2012, 21 patients with type B3 injuries (Magerl classification) were treated in our centres. The thoracic spine was involved in 14 and the lumbar spine in seven patients. The patients' average age was 61.8 years, with a range of 33 to 87 years. There were three women and 18 men. Six fractures occurred in previously healthy spines, five and 10 were in AS- and DISH-affected spines, respectively. The evaluation included the mechanism of injury, patient's weight and height, neurological findings, type of treatment and its result, outcome after treatment termination, complications and associated diseases and injuries. RESULTS: The mechanism of injury differed between the healthy and disease-affected spines. All five AS patients suffered low-energy fractures while patients with previously healthy spines had high-energy injuries. The DISH patients had both low- and high-energy fractures. Type B3.1.1 fractures were diagnosed in two AS patients and six DISH patients, and in no previously healthy patient. Type B3.1.2 fractures were found in one AS patient, two DISH patients and one previously healthy patient. Type B3.2 fracture occurred in one patient with a previously healthy spine, in two AS and two DISH patients. Type B3.3 fractures were in four patients with previously healthy spines. Neurological deficit was found in five injured patients, four of whom had complete paraplegia (Frankel grade A) which did not improve. One AS patient in whom the spinal fracture was associated with Frankel grade C injury improved to Frankel D after surgery. All patients had an elevated BMI, ranging from 25.1 to 41.9; the average value was 32.2, which is within grade 1 obesity. Associated injuries were found in 11 patients, mostly in those with high-energy trauma. Seventeen patients were treated surgically, four conservatively. Posterior stabilisation was carried out in 10 patients who had either AS or DISH conditions; seven patients had a short spinal stabilisation. Complications included early infection in two patients, cerebrospinal fluid fistula in one, urinary tract infection in one and confused state of mind in two patients. All patients healed well but for one patient who died at 4 months after injury due to multiple complications. DISCUSSION: In the majority of relevant publications these injuries are reported in patients suffering from hyperossification disorders such as AS or DISH. In patients with healthy spines they occur less frequently and the traumatic hyperextension mechanism must have great intensity. Fractures of a hyperossified spine are related to obesity and this was also confirmed by our study in which all patients were overweight or obese. This factor plays an important role in the hyperextension mechanism that produces a sudden overcoming of the resistance of a spinal segment to force, resulting in a type B3 fracture. CONCLUSION: A different approach to these fractures is required in comparison with other spinal fractures. Type B3 fractures have some features common with type C fractures and are frequent in spines affected by spinal disease. In hyperossification disorders, paradoxically associated with advanced osteoporosis, fracture treatment requires long instrumentation. In healthy spines, fractures are treated with short instrumentation. In AS and DISH patients, the diagnosis may be delayed because these patients suffer from chronic spine pain and the pain due to fracture may be attributed to an accelerated chronic condition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of additional (MRI) compared with computed tomography (CT) alone for the classification of traumatic spinal injuries using the Arbeitsgemeinshaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) system and the Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity (TLICS) scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images from 100 consecutive patients with at least one fracture on CT were evaluated retrospectively by three radiologists with regard to the AO and TLICS classification systems in 2 steps. First, all images from the initial CT examination were analyzed. Second, 6 weeks later, CT and MR images were analyzed together. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon tests were performed to identify changes in the number of fractures and ligamentous lesions detected and their corresponding classification. RESULTS: CT and MRI together revealed a total of 196 fractures (CT alone 162 fractures). The AO classification changed in 31 {\%}, the TLICS classification changed in 33 {\%} of the patients compared with CT alone. Based on CT and MRI together, the TLICS value changed from values {\textless}5 (indication for conservative therapy) to values {\textgreater}/= 5 (indication for surgical therapy) in 24 {\%}. CONCLUSION: MRI of patients with thoracolumbar spinal trauma considerably improved the detection of fractures and soft tissue injuries compared with CT alone and significantly changed the overall trauma classification.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to research the effectiveness of customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis treatment for stable burst type thoracolumbar vertebral fractures without neurological deficits. METHODS: The study included 26 patients (14 males, 12 females; mean age: 46.03 years; range: 18 to 64 years) conservatively treated for thoracolumbar (T11-L2) burst type vertebral fractures according to Denis classification between 2002 and 2009. Etiology were a fall from various heights in 12 patients (46.2{\%}), motor vehicle accidents as an occupant in 7 (26.9{\%}) and as a pedestrian in 4 (15.4{\%}), and simple fall in 3 (11.5{\%}). None of the patients had neurologic deficit and no damage was found in the posterior ligamentous complex in MRI evaluations. Denis pain and functional scales were used in the clinical evaluation. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index and height loss percentage were measured in the radiologic evaluation. Post-fracture and follow-up values were compared. Mean follow-up period was 41.30 (range: 14 to 80) months. RESULTS: Mean pain and functional scores were 1.65 and 1.15 points, respectively, at the final follow-up. Twenty patients returned to their pre-trauma work and activities completely and six patients with small limitations. Mean period for returning to work was 3.64 (range: 2 to 6) months. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index and height loss percentage values increased significantly at follow-up (p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION: The conservative treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures is widely accepted. Early mobilization with customized TLSO brace appears to produce effective functional results despite loss of vertebral body height.},

abstract = {The study aim was to develop and apply an experimental technique to determine the biomechanical effect of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate (CaP) cement on the stiffness and strength of augmented vertebrae following traumatic fracture. Twelve burst type fractures were generated in porcine three-vertebra segments. The specimens were randomly split into two groups (n=6), imaged using microCT and tested under axial loading. The two groups of fractured specimens underwent a vertebroplasty procedure, one group was augmented with CaP cement designed and developed at Queen's University Belfast. The other group was augmented with PMMA cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK). The specimens were imaged and re-tested . An intact single vertebra specimen group (n=12) was also imaged and tested under axial loading. A significant decrease (p{\textless}0.01) was found between the stiffness of the fractured and intact groups, demonstrating that the fractures generated were sufficiently severe, to adversely affect mechanical behaviour. Significant increase (p{\textless}0.01) in failure load was found for the specimen group augmented with the PMMA cement compared to the pre-augmentation group, conversely, no significant increase (p{\textless}0.01) was found in the failure load of the specimens augmented with CaP cement, this is attributed to the significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower volume of CaP cement that was successfully injected into the fracture, compared to the PMMA cement. The effect of the percentage of cement fracture fill, cement modulus on the specimen stiffness and ultimate failure load could be investigated further by using the methods developed within this study to test a more injectable CaP cement.},

METHODS: In the study, 35 patients were reviewed,including 20 males and 15 females, with an average age of 34.1 years (18 to 52), and the mean follow-up for 25.8 months (24 to 36). RESULTS: The duration of surgery was (95.8+/-12.3) minutes and intraoperative blood loss was (83.0+/-40.7) mL. There were no major perioperative complications, with the exception of 2 patients who developed a superficial wound infection. LKA and VBH were significantly improved immediately after surgery (P{\textless}0.001). No significant loss of correction was observed in all the patients(P{\textgreater}0.05). Screw misplacement was observed in 9/140 (6.4{\%}) and no patient showed neurological deficit as a result of screw misplacement. CONCLUSION: The minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screw has a good clinical outcome in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with posterior ligamentous complex injury, which could maintain the fracture reduction effectively, and minimize the iatrogenic soft tissue injury.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Rotator cuff (RC) repair-especially in the elderly population-is problematic since the patients suffer to a high extent from bone mineral density loss at the reattachment site. Therefore, the study was primarily driven by the question whether it is possible to reach more or qualitatively better cancellous bone and thus a more stable postoperative result if anchors with greater length are used for RC repair and/or the conventional anchors are screwed deeper into the bone. In anatomical terms, the question is raised whether cancellous bone is of better quality close to or far off the RC enthesis. METHODS: Axial HRqCT scans (X-tremeCT, Scanco Medical) of 36 human cadaveric humeral heads (75 +/- 11 years) were performed to determine the ratio of bone volume to total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Trab Th), number of trabecles (Trab N), trabecular separation (Trab Sp) as well as non-metric indices such as connectivity density (Conn Dens) and structure model index (SMI). Within the greater tuberosity (GT), 6 volumes of interest (VOI) (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2), in the lesser tuberosity (LT) 2 VOIs (D1, D2) and one control VOI in the subchondral bone were set. The analyzed bone cylinder of each VOI was divided into a superficial and a deep portion. RESULTS: The parameters BV/TV, Trab N, Trab Th and Conn Dens in all volumes of the GT and LT revealed higher values in the superficial portion reaching different levels of significance (p {\textless} 0.001/{\textless}0.05). The only parameter presenting a higher value in the deep portion was Trab Sp, but this was the case for all GT and LT regions. Interestingly, the difference between the superficial and deep portion reached significance for the non-metric parameter SMI in no volume of the GT/LT, although the higher values were found superficially. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that cancellous bone presents with decreasing bone quality when analyzing increasingly deeper portions of the bone cylinders of the GT and LT starting at the articular surface. This information seems to be crucial for shoulder surgeons, especially when treating elderly patients. Our results clearly prove that screwing in anchors to a deeper extent will not improve stability, since the deeper bone stock is of worse quality.},

abstract = {Implants currently used for reconstruction of a burst vertebral body are associated with complications, including subsidence, nonunion, and substantial intraoperative blood loss. A new reconstruction device, the U-Cage (Double Engine Medical Material Ltd, Xiamen, Fujian, China), was designed to minimize complications.Six intact adult cadaver thoracolumbar (T11-L3) spines were collected and scanned by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The stiffness of the burst spine was subsequently compared with its previous intact state during flexion/extension, lateral bending, and rotation, and then subjected to a cyclic test to predict cage subsidence and device loosening. Axial load was applied continuously until failure to test the peak load that the specimen could withstand during the cyclic test. The correlation of bone mineral density and peak load was also analyzed. The instrumented specimens were found to be equivalent to intact bone in all directions (P{\textgreater}.05), with the exception of left rotation (P{\textless}.05). All specimens could withstand the cyclic test, and no subsidence or loosening of the device was detected. Average peak load for the instrumented specimens was 4137.5 N, which correlated with the average bone mineral density (r=0.915; P=.011).Thoracolumbar burst fractures instrumented with a U-Cage and anterolateral D-rod fixation achieved a stiffness similar to that of intact spines. This procedure may avoid the subsidence of the cage in vivo and serve as a better option for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A gross anatomic and motion analysis study in cadavers. OBJECTIVE:  Assess spinal motion in a cadaveric spinal fracture model and investigate the ability of external orthoses to control this motion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: External orthoses are frequently prescribed for patients who have experienced burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine. Despite the substantial expense involved, there is little data confirming their value. METHODS: A T12 burst fracture model was created in 5 lightly embalmed cadavers by resecting the anterior and middle columns of the T12 vertebra through a thoracolumbar anterior approach to the spine. An electromagnetic motion tracking and analysis system was used to track angular and linear displacement at the fracture during routine patient maneuvers. Several commonly used orthoses, including an extension brace and both an "off-the-shelf" and custom-molded thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO), were applied to the cadavers and the affect on fracture site motion was assessed. RESULTS: Application of all 3 styles of brace resulted in angular motion of 8 degrees to 12 degrees in flexion-extension, 11 degrees to 20 degrees in axial rotation, and 8 degrees to 10 degrees of lateral bending. Brace application resulted in linear displacement of 29 to 46 mm in the medial-lateral plane, 21 to 23 mm in the axial plane, and 21 to 37 mm in the anterior-posterior plane. During logrolling maneuvers, TLSO style braces diminished angular motion, although residual motion in the range of 5 degrees remained. TLSO style braces had little effect on linear translation. When placed in a seated position in bed, TLSO style braces diminished flexion and extension modestly, but did not influence lateral bending or linear translation. Extension style braces had no effect on fracture motion during any activity tested. CONCLUSION: In a cadaver model of a burst fracture, there is surprising angular and linear motion at the fracture during common hospital activities. TLSO orthoses can decrease angular motion but do not effect translation at the fracture. An extension orthosis had no effect on motion at the spinal fracture site.},

abstract = {There is currently no injury assessment for thoracic or lumbar spine fractures in the motor vehicle crash standards throughout the world. Compression-related thoracolumbar fractures are occurring in frontal impacts and yet the mechanism of injury is poorly understood. The objective of this investigation was to characterize these injuries using real world crash data from the US-DOT-NHTSA NASS-CDS and CIREN databases. Thoracic and lumbar AIS vertebral body fracture codes were searched for in the two databases. The NASS database was used to characterize population trends as a function of crash year and vehicle model year. The CIREN database was used to examine a case series in more detail. From the NASS database there were 2000-4000 occupants in frontal impacts with thoracic and lumbar vertebral body fractures per crash year. There was an increasing trend in incidence rate of thoracolumbar fractures in frontal impact crashes as a function of vehicle model year from 1986 to 2008; this was not the case for other crash types. From the CIREN database, the thoracolumbar spine was most commonly fractured at either the T12 or L1 level. Major, burst type fractures occurred predominantly at T12, L1 or L5; wedge fractures were most common at L1. Most CIREN occupants were belted; there were slightly more females involved; they were almost all in bucket seats; impact location occurred approximately half the time on the road and half off the road. The type of object struck also seemed to have some influence on fractured spine level, suggesting that the crash deceleration pulse may be influential in the type of compression vector that migrates up the spinal column. Future biomechanical studies are required to define mechanistically how these fractures are influenced by these many factors.},

abstract = {Numerous improvements in minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) have been made during the last decade. MISS in thoracolumbar spine trauma management must achieve the same results as conventional treatment but with less morbidity. The increased use of MISS technologies in spine trauma has been correlated to the availability of more versatile instrumentation, which makes the fixation of all thoracic and lumbar levels possible. Balloon-assisted techniques have been used to support the anterior column in a stand-alone manner or in combination with open or percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. Fluoroscopy-assisted pedicle screw insertion is associated with less pedicle wall violation when compared to open surgery, but with increased radiation exposure for the surgeon and patient. Surgeons must be aware of this issue and new technologies are available to decrease irradiation. The advantages of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation relative to open surgery are discussed: preservation of posterior musculature, less blood loss, shorter operative time, lower infection risk, less postoperative pain, shorter rehabilitation time as well as shorter hospital stay. Limitations of percutaneous fixation include the inability to achieve direct spinal canal decompression and not having the option to perform a fusion. Nevertheless, these limitations can be addressed by combining MISS with open techniques. Indications for percutaneous spine fixation alone or in combination with MISS or open techniques are discussed based on the AO classification. The benefits of percutaneous spinal fixation for unstable spine fractures in polytrauma patients are also discussed. Posterior instrumentation can be easily removed after bone union to allow young patients to regain their mobility. Large well-controlled prospective studies are needed to draw up guidelines for less invasive procedures in spine trauma. In the future, development of new technologies can expand the scope of indications and treatment possibilities using MISS techniques in spine trauma.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of bone cement-augmented short segment fixation using percutaneous screws for thoracolumbar burst fractures in a background of severe osteoporosis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with a single-level thoracolumbar burst fracture (T11-L2) accompanying severe osteoporosis treated from January 2008 to November 2009 were prospectively analyzed. Surgical procedures included postural reduction for 3 days and bone cement augmented percutaneous screw fixation at the fracture level and at adjacent levels without bone fusion. Due to the possibility of implant failure, patients underwent implant removal 12 months after screw fixation. Imaging and clinical findings, including involved vertebral levels, local kyphosis, canal encroachment, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, mean pain score (visual analogue scale) was 8.2 and this decreased to a mean of 2.2 at 12 months after screw fixation. None of the patients complained of pain worsening during the 6 months following implant removal. The percentage of canal compromise at the fractured level improved from a mean of 41.0{\%} to 18.4{\%} at 12 months after surgery. Mean kyphotic angle was improved significantly from 19.8 degrees before surgery to 7.8 at 12 months after screw fixation. Canal compromise and kyphotic angle improvements were maintained at 6 months after implant removal. No significant neurological deterioration or complications occurred after screw removal in any patient. CONCLUSION: Bone cement augmented short segment fixation using a percutaneous system can be an alternative to the traditional open technique for the management of selected thoracolumbar burst fractures accompanied by severe osteoporosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We compared the radiological and clinical outcomes between patients who underwent posterior fixation alone and supplemented with fusion following the onset of thoracolumbar burst fractures. In addition, we also evaluated the necessity of posterolateral fusion for patients treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation. METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2009, 46 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture were included in this study. On the basis of posterolateral fusion, we divided our patients into the non-fusion group and the fusion group. The radiological assessment was performed according to the Cobb's method, and results were obtained at immediately, 3, 6, 12 months after surgery. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the modified Mcnab criteria at the final follow-up. RESULTS: The demographic data and the mean follow-up period were similar between the two groups. Patients of both groups achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes. The mean loss of kyphosis correction showed that patients of both groups experienced loss of correction with no respect to whether they underwent the posterolateral fusion. There was no significant difference in the degree of loss of correction at any time points of the follow-up between the two groups. In addition, we also compared the effect of fixed levels (i.e., short versus long segment) on loss of correction between the two groups and there was no significant difference. There were no major complications postoperatively and during follow-up period. CONCLUSION: We suggest that posterolateral fusion may be unnecessary for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures who underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the reasons for the failure of thoracolumbar spine internal fixation after burst fracture, and to discuss the strategy for revision surgery. METHODS: From January 2005 to September 2010, 21 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture received revision surgery after the failure of internal fixation. The etiology included loose of the fixation after anterior surgery in 4 patients, involving malunion with severe kyphosis in 1 patient, pedicle screw malposition in 3, fracture of adjacent segment vertebra in 2, broken of the fixation as non-union of the fracture vertebra in 10 comprising obvious kyphotic deformity in 5, and 2 had developing kyphosis for over distraction of the vertebra followed by pseudarthrosis after removing the internal fixation. After the first operation, symptoms remained in 6 patients, deteriorated in 7, light to moderate improved in 8. Surgical procedures such as anterior corpectomy and reconstruction, replacement of the internal fixation and canal decompression, vertebroplasty, and posterior pedicle subtraction osteotomy were directed based on individual situation. RESULTS: Patients were followed-up for 6-68 (27.0+/-13.2) months, and demonstrated solid fusion 6 to 12 months postoperatively. No failure of the internal fixation reccurred. No major complications or deterioration of neurologic status were noted. At the last follow-up, the improvement of Frankel grade was 0-2 (1.3+/-0.7). The mean visual analog scale (VAS) dropped down from 7.6 to 2.1, and the mean oswestry disability index (ODI) decreased from 48.7 to 10.3. Preoperative angle of 7 kyphotic deformity patients was 10 degree-75 degree (42.5 degree+/-15.3 degree), and was improved to -3 degree-10 degree (2.3 degree+/-3.7 degree). At the last follow-up, the loss of correction was 0 degree-1.3 degree (0.7 degree+/-0.3 degree), with the correction rate of 92.3{\%}. CONCLUSION: Solid reconstruction of the anterior and middle column of the spine is the imperative procedure to prevent failure of internal fixation in thoracolumbar burst fractures. Revision surgery with reasonable strategy is beneficial and rewarding with few complications.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, consecutive case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate which variable has a strong association with neurological damage in thoracolumbar burst fractures (T12 or L1): severity of injury or narrowing of the spinal canal. SETTING: Department of Spine Surgery, the Affiliated Hospital, Luzhou Medical College, Sichuan Province, China. METHODS: This study included 42 patients with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12 or L1), 24 patients with neurological deficit, and 18 patients without deficit. The severity of injury was determined using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), and the narrowing of the spinal canal was measured by axial computed tomography. The statistical comparison of the neurological deficit and the non-neurological deficit was carried out using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney test). The correlation of these scores and narrowing of the spinal canal to the neurological status was determined using a Spearman correlation test. RESULT: Higher ISS (21 vs. 11), NISS (30 vs. 15), Injury Severity Score with modification (ISSM) (13 vs. 11), New Injury Severity Score with modification (NISSM) (21 vs. 15), and canal compromise (48 vs. 25) were found in patients with neurological deficit, which evidently yielded statistical differences between the patients with neurological deficit and those without (P{\textless}0.01), and they also had a positive correlation with the American Spine Injury Association (ASIA) score (r{\textgreater}0.5, P{\textless}0.001). Moreover, there was also a positive correlation (r=0.375, P{\textless}0.05) between ISSM and ASIA scores, although it seemed weak. The correlations between the NISS, NISSM, and neurological deficit (respectively r=0.868, P{\textless}0.001; r=0.676, P{\textless}0.001) were stronger than with the narrowing of the spinal canal (r=0.560, P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NISS have a closer correlation with neurological deficit in thoracolumbar burst fractures; thus, we can put forward a hypothesis that perhaps NISS is able to reflect the dynamic fracture process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The classification and therapeutic strategy for thoracolumbar burst fractures are controversial. The load-sharing classification (LSC) and thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) are both quantitative evaluation systems for thoracolumbar burst fractures. We hypothesized that their combination would be helpful not only for surgical indications but also for deciding on the surgical approach. However, no reports have evaluated the relationship between them. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between the LSC and TLICS and investigate the clinical usefulness of their combination. METHODS: This study included 100 consecutive patients surgically treated for thoracolumbar burst fractures (71 men and 29 women; mean age 36 years). Clinical and radiographical data as well as thoracolumbar injury classification systems were evaluated. RESULTS: LSC and TLICS scores were found to be statistically correlated. The mean LSC score with a TLICS score of 5 or more (surgical treatment recommended) was 7.3 +/- 1.2 points, and the mean LSC score with a TLICS score of 3 or less (conservative treatment recommended) was 6.1 +/- 1.3 points. The mean TLICS score with an LSC score of 7 or more (additional anterior reconstruction recommended) was 6.6 +/- 2.7 points, and the mean TLICS score with an LSC score of 6 or less (expectation of good clinical results with posterior short fusion) was 5.0 +/- 2.5 points. The TLICS score was 3 or less, and the LSC score was 7 or more in 13 patients (13 {\%}). CONCLUSION: Although the TLICS scores correlated with the LSC scores, a single application of TLICS might not be sufficient to identify those patients who have a TLICS score of 3 or less and an LSC score of 7 or more as surgically indicated. However, an additional LSC evaluation avoided deviations as the two classifications complemented each other, and it was useful in determining the best treatment options for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanical response of the spinal cord during burst fracture was  seldom quantitatively addressed and only few studies look into the internal strain of the white and grey matters within the spinal cord during thoracolumbar burst fracture (TLBF). The aim of the study is to investigate the mechanical response of the spinal cord during TLBF and correlate the percent canal compromise (PCC) with the strain in the spinal cord. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model of human T12-L1 spinal cord with visco-elastic property was generated based on the transverse sections images of spinal cord, and the model was validated against published literatures under static uniaxial tension and compression. With the validated model, a TLBF simulation was performed to compute the mechanical strain in the spinal cord with the PCC. Linear regressions between PCC and strain in the spinal cord show that at the initial stage, with the PCC at 20{\%}, and 45{\%}, the corresponding mechanical strains in ventral grey, dorsal grey, ventral white, dorsal white matters were 0.06, 0.04, 0.12, 0.06, and increased to 0.14, 0.12, 0.23, and 0.13, respectively. At the recoiled stage, when the PCC was decreased from 45{\%} to 20{\%}, the corresponding strains were reduced to 0.03, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.03. The strain was correlated well with PCC. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The simulation shows that the strain in the spinal cord correlated well with the PCC, and the mechanical strains in the ventral regions are higher than those in the dorsal regions of spinal cord tissue during burst fracture, suggesting that the ventral regions of the spinal cord may susceptible to injury than the dorsal regions.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes, and safety and efficacy of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with PPSF in a single hospital from 2010 to 2011. Baseline data included patient demographics, mechanism of injuries, fracture level, neurologic status and the number of percutaneous screws inserted. Kyphotic angle correction, vertebral body height restoration and mid-sagittal canal diameter improvement were used to assess radiological outcome. Screw misplacement, operative complications, functional improvement (ASIA score) and pain score on visual analogue scale were used to assess safety and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 21 patients with 25 thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with 134 percutaneous screws. There was significant improvement in kyphotic angle correction (mean difference 6.1 degrees, p = 0.006), restoration of anterior and posterior vertebral height (mean difference 19.7{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01 and mean difference 6.6{\%}, p = 0.007, respectively) and mid-sagittal canal diameter (mean difference 15.6{\%}, p = 0.007) on discharge. These improvements remained statistically significant at six months post operation for restoration of anterior vertebral body height (mean difference 9.8{\%}, p = 0.05) and mid-sagittal diameter (mean difference 30.0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this first local review, we have shown that PPSF is a relatively safe and effective technique for treating selected thoracolumbar burst fractures, and that it yields satisfactory results. However, its long-term outcome and efficacy need to be further evaluated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of selective treatment of senile osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures of Denis type B with kyphoplasty and Jack vertebral dilator. METHODS: Between August 2007 and May 2011, 30 patients (32 vertebra) with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures of Denis type B were treated with kyphoplasty and Jack vertebral dilator. There were 7 males and 23 females, aged 57-85 years (mean, 76.9 years). The injured vertebrae included T11 in 2 vertebrae, T12 in 11 vertebrae, L1 in 7 vertebrae, L2 in 5 vertebrae, L3 in 3 vertebrae, and L4 in 4 vertebrae. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Oswestry disability index (ODI), the anterior and middle height of the vertebral body, and the Cobb angle were assessed before and after operation. RESULTS: The operation was completed smoothly in all cases; no cement leakage or intraoperative complication was found. Obvious back pain relief was achieved in all patients after operation. Thirty patients were followed up at 1 week and 6 months after operation. The VAS score was decreased from 8.2 +/- 1.3 before operation to 1.5 +/- 0.9 at 1 week after operation and 1.9 +/- 0.5 at 6 months after operation; the ODI was decreased from 82.4{\%} +/- 15.0{\%} to 17.8{\%} +/- 9.5{\%} and 23.0{\%} +/- 8.6{\%}; the anterior height of the vertebral body was increased from (19.5 +/- 3.2) mm to (24.8 +/- 3.0) mm and (24.0 +/- 2.6) mm; the middle height of the vertebral body was increased from (18.5 +/- 3.4) mm to (23.7 +/- 3.7) mm and (22.8 +/- 3.5) mm; the Cobb angle was decreased from (14.9 +/- 7.5)degrees to (7.6 +/- 6.0)degrees and (8.3 +/- 6.0)degrees; and there were significant differences in the VAS score, ODI, the anterior and middle height of the vertebral body, and the Cobb angle between at pre- and at post-operation (P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant difference between at 1 week and at 6 months after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty with Jack vertebral dilator for selective treatment of senile osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures of Denis type B can restore the anterior and middle height of the vertebral body, correct the Cobb angle, and relieve pain, and it has good short-term effectiveness and safety.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The diaphragmatic height index (DHI) was developed to measure the difference in diaphragm levels. The purpose of this study was to set definite DHI values and test the accuracy of these values for use as a new diagnostic test for phrenic nerve dysfunction. METHODS: All data for this study were obtained from medical charts and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five patients with brachial plexus injury who had undergone nerve transfers between 2005 and 2008 were divided into Groups A and B. Group A consisted of 40 patients (mean age 28.0 years) who had sustained concomitant injury of the brachial plexus and phrenic nerves. Patients in Group A1 had right phrenic nerve injury and those in Group A2 had left phrenic nerve injury. Intraoperative direct electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve was considered the gold standard in assessing nerve function in all patients with brachial plexus injury. Group B consisted of 125 patients (mean age 28.7 years) with brachial plexus injury and normal phrenic nerve function. Group C, the control group, consisted of 80 patients with nonbrachial plexus injury (mean age 34.0 years) who had undergone other kinds of orthopedic operations between April and June 2009. Standard posteroanterior chest radiographs were blindly interpreted using the Siriraj inhouse picture archiving and communication system in all 245 patients in the study. First, a reference line (R line) was drawn along the inferior endplate of T-10. Then, 2 lines (lines A and B) were drawn through the highest point of each diaphragm and parallel to the R line. The difference between these 2 lines divided by the height of T-10 was defined as the DHI. The cutoff points of the DHI for diagnosing right and left phrenic nerve dysfunction were analyzed with a receiver operating characteristic curve. The accuracy of these DHI values was then evaluated. The DHI in Group C was 0.64 +/- 0.44, slightly higher than the DHI in Group B, with no significant difference. Diaphragmatic height indexes in Groups A1 and A2 were 2.0 +/- 0.99 and -1.04 +/- 0.83, respectively, which were significantly different from those in Groups B and C (p {\textless} 0.05). The cutoff point of the DHI for diagnosing right phrenic nerve dysfunction was {\textgreater} 1.1, and that for left phrenic nerve dysfunction was {\textless} 0.2. The sensitivity and specificity of right and left DHI values were 90.5{\%} and 86.3{\%}, and 94.7 and 88.3{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study show that diaphragm paralysis can be simply and reliably predicted by the DHI. Diaphragmatic height index values {\textgreater} 1.1 and {\textless} 0.2 are proposed as the new diagnostic test for right and left phrenic nerve dysfunction with a high degree of accuracy. This index is applicable in diagnosing phrenic nerve dysfunction that occurs concomitantly with brachial plexus injury or from other etiologies.},

abstract = {OBJECT: External supports serve as a traditional treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs). However, the role of external supports in the treatment of OVF remains inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of a rigid external support in the healing of OVFs by prospectively evaluating union (fracture settling) rates and prognostic variables for patients suffering from an incident OVF. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with acute back pain were enrolled in this study after being diagnosed with an OVF based on MRI findings. Patients were treated using a plastic thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) and underwent follow-up at 2, 3, and 6 months. Vertebrae were referred to as "settled" when there was no dynamic mobility on sitting lateral and supine lateral radiographs. At the time of the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, the patients were divided into 2 groups, the "settled group" and the "unsettled group." Patients in these groups were compared with regard to clinical and radiographic features. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients enrolled, 53 patients were followed up for 6 months. There were 14 men and 39 women with an average age of 75.3 years. Fracture settling of the affected vertebra was defined in 54.7{\%} of the patients at 2 months, in 79.2{\%} at 3 months, and in 88.7{\%} at 6 months. All 5 components of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire improved significantly both at 3 months and 6 months. Patients in the unsettled group exhibited a statistically greater likelihood of having fractures at the thoracolumbar junction, Type A3 fractures, and fractures with a diffuse low-intensity area on T2-weighted MRI studies at 3 months. In contrast, at 6 months, the only statistically significant difference between the groups was patient age. CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical disadvantages of OVFs (location, type, and size) adversely influencing the fracture healing were overcome by the treatment using a TLSO within 6 months. The authors' findings show that a TLSO plays a biomechanical role in the healing of OVFs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of a pedicle screw at the level of fracture, also known as an intermediate screw, has been shown to improve clinical results in managing lumbar fracture, but there is a paucity of biomechanical studies to support the claim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding intermediate pedicle screws at the level of a fracture on the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using monoaxial or polyaxial screws and to compare the strength of monoaxial and polyaxial screws in the calf spine fracture model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flexibility of 12 fresh-frozen calf lumbar spine specimens was evaluated in all planes. An unstable burst fracture model was created at the level of L3 by the pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. The specimens were randomly divided into monoaxial pedicle screw (MPS) and polyaxial pedicle screw (PPS) groups. Flexibility was retested without and with intermediate screws (MPSi and PPSi) placed at the level of fracture in addition to standard screws placed at L2 and L4. RESULTS: The addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the constructs, as measured by a decreased range of motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, and lateral bending in both MPS and PPS groups (P {\textless} 0.05). There was neither any significant difference in the ROM in the spines of the two groups before injury, nor a difference in the ROM between the MPSi and PPSi groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but there was a significant difference between MPS and PPS in flexion and extension in the short-segment fixation group (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stability of short-segment pedicle screw fixation in both the MPS and PPS groups. However, in short-segment fixation group, monoaxial pedicle screw exhibited more stability in flexion and extension than the polyaxial pedicle screw.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, 2-center, observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: Investigate clinical and radiologic outcomes of bracing versus no-bracing in the treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Management of thoracolumbar burst fractures depends upon clinical presentation of neurological deficit and radiographic features of fracture severity. Neurologically intact patients with mild deformity and biomechanical stability may be treated with conservative therapy. METHODS: Patients with stable (AO type A3), single level, thoracolumbar burst fractures between T12 and L2 with no neurological deficit were randomized to nonoperative treatment with a customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) or no-brace. Self-reported clinical outcomes of pain, disability, and health-related quality of life, and radiographic outcomes of kyphotic progression and loss of vertebral height, assessed by 2 independent reviewers blinded to treatment group, were measured at 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-three consecutive eligible patients were included (TLSO: n=12; no-brace: n=11). There were no between-group differences regarding level of injury (P=0.75) and baseline spine geometry including fractional canal compromise (P=0.49), anterior loss of vertebral body height (P=0.28), and sagittal Cobb angle (P=0.13). In-hospital stay was significantly shorter in the no-brace group (mean: 2.8+/-3.0 d) compared with the TLSO group (mean: 6.3+/-2.1 d; P=0.004). At follow-up there were no differences in anterior loss of vertebral body height (TLSO: 12.5{\%}+/-10.2{\%} vs. no-brace: 11.9{\%}+/-8.1{\%}; P=0.88), kyphotic progression (TLSO: 5.3+/-4.4 degrees vs. no-brace 5.2+/-3.6 degrees; P=0.93), adverse events, or self-reported clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologically intact patients with stable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with or without bracing had similar radiographic and clinical outcomes at 6 months follow-up. The no-brace group had shorter in-hospital lengths of stay. Conservative therapy involving early mobilization without brace immobilization may be warranted. Further studies with a larger series of patients and longer follow-up are required for conclusive findings.},

abstract = {In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a surface functionalization delivery platform incorporating heparin onto strontium alginate microbeads surfaces would convert this "naive carriers" into "mini-reservoirs" for localized in vivo delivery of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) that will induce functional bone regeneration. In vitro evaluation confirmed that (1) heparin incorporation could immobilize and prolong rhBMP-2 release for approximately 3 weeks; (2) a significant decrease (p{\textless}0.01) in rhBMP-2 burst release is attainable depending on initial protein load; and (3) rhBMP-2 released from surface functionalized microbeads retained bioactivity and stimulated higher alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured C(2)C(12) cells when compared with daily administration of fresh bolus rhBMP-2. Subsequently, surface functionalized microbeads were used for in vivo delivery of rhBMP-2 at local sites of posterolateral spinal fusion surgery in rats. The microbeads were loaded into the pores of medical-grade polyepsilone caprolactone-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds before implantation. Results revealed robust bone formation and a biomechanically solid fusion after 6 weeks. When compared with a control group consisting of an equivalent amount of rhBMP-2 that was directly adsorbed onto bare-surfaced microbeads with no heparin, a 5.3-fold increase in bone volume fraction and a 2.6-fold increase in bending stiffness (flexion/extension) were observed. When compared with collagen sponge carriers of rhBMP-2, a 1.5-fold and a 1.3-fold increase in bone volume fraction and bending stiffness were observed, respectively. More importantly, 3D micro-computed tomography images enabled the visualization of a well-contained newly formed bone at ipsilateral implant sites with surface functionalized rhBMP-2 delivery. This was absent with collagen sponge carriers where newly formed bone tissue was poorly contained and crossed over the posterior midline to contralateral implants. These findings are important because of complications with current rhBMP-2 delivery method, including excessive, uncontrolled bone formation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine disc degeneration at levels adjacent and next adjacent to the fractured vertebra and to analyses, if the disc degeneration is determined by the endplate fracture. Thoracolumbar burst fracture is one of the most common spinal injuries. The diagnostic (clinical and imaging) approach and treatment of a fractured vertebra is well established; however, some controversy remains. The associated disc degeneration is less well known after 9-12 months of the short segment pedicle screw fixations. There is a major controversy whether spinal trauma with vertebral endplate fractures can result in posttraumatic disc degeneration. No study to date, however, has assessed disc degeneration of the AO type A3 thoracolumbar fractures without neurologic deficits after pedicle screw fixations. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with single-level AO type A3 thoracolumbar fractures and no neurological deficit were treated by using postural reduction and short segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. No laminectomy and fusion were performed. Implants were removed 9-12 months after the first operation. The thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess disc degeneration at levels adjacent and next adjacent to the fractured vertebra before the first operation and after the second operation in a retrospective study. RESULTS: After the instrumentation removal, new disc degeneration was usually found at level adjacent to the cranial endplate of fractured vertebra by MRI examination in 24 patients. The average Pfirrmann grade of degenerative discs adjacent to the cranial fractured endplates deteriorated from 2.1 pre-operatively to 3.4 after the second operation. No change of disc degeneration was seen at the caudal disc space adjacent to the fractured vertebra and the levels next adjacent to the fractured vertebra. The discs next adjacent to the fractured vertebra were showed to be relatively normal without changes of degeneration during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Disc degeneration usually occurs at level adjacent to the fractured endplate of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Endplate fracture is strongly associated with disc degeneration. No correlation between fixation level and disc degeneration is seen in this study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe spinal fracture patterns presenting to deployed medical facilities during recent military operations. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the United Kingdom Centre for Defence Imaging Computed Tomography database, 2005-2009. Fractures are classified, mechanism noted and associated injuries recorded. Statistical analysis is by Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: 128 fractures in 57 casualties are analysed. Ballistic (79{\%}) and non-ballistic mechanisms contribute to vertebral fracture at all regions of the spinal column in patients treated at deployed medical facilities. There is a high incidence of lumbar spine fractures, which are more likely to be due to explosion than gunshot wounding (p {\textless} 0.05). Two thirds of thoracolumbar spine fractures caused by explosive devices are unstable and are mainly burst-fractures in configuration. 60{\%} of spinal fracture patients had concomitant injuries. There is a strong relationship between spinal fractures caused by explosions and lower limb fractures. CONCLUSION: Injuries to the spine caused by explosive devices account for greater numbers, greater associated morbidity and increasing complexity than other means of spinal injury managed in contemporary warfare. With the predominance of explosive injury in current conflict, this work provides the first detail of an evolving injury mechanism with implications for injury mitigation research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of screw fixation without bone fusion for unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fracture. METHODS: Nine patients younger than 40 years underwent screw fixation without bone fusion, following postural reduction using a soft roll at the involved vertebra, in cases of burst fracture. Their motor power was intact in spite of severe canal compromise. The surgical procedure included postural reduction for 3 days and screw fixations at one level above, one level below and at the fractured level itself. The patients underwent removal of implants 12 months after the initial operation, due to possibility of implant failure. Imaging and clinical findings, including canal encroachment, vertebral height, clinical outcome, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, the mean pain score (visual analogue scale) was 8.2, which decreased to 2.2 at 12 months after screw fixation. None of the patients complained of worsening of pain during 6 months after implant removal. All patients were graded as having excellent or good outcomes at 6 months after implant removal. The proportion of canal compromise at the fractured level improved from 55{\%} to 35{\%} at 12 months after surgery. The mean preoperative vertebral height loss was 45.3{\%}, which improved to 20.6{\%} at 6 months after implant removal. There were no neurological deficits related to neural injury. The improved vertebral height and canal compromise were maintained at 6 months after implant removal. CONCLUSION: Short segment pedicle screw fixation, including fractured level itself, without bone fusion following postural reduction can be an effective and safe operative technique in the management of selected young patients suffering from unstable burst fracture.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Autologous bone graft is the gold standard for vertebral body replacement. Currently, after modern implants for vertebral body replacement are available, controversies exist regarding the optimal implant strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2003, 17 patients were included in this study, all suffering from incomplete burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. All of them were treated by ventral monosegmental spondylodesis using iliac crest bone graft. The individual treatment strategy depended on the fracture situation and patient's condition. After an average of 74 months (range 66-84) a clinical and computer tomographic follow-up examination was performed in 14 patients (average age, 35.2 years) including VAS spine score and SF 36 score. Nine patients were treated ventral only five patients dorsoventrally. RESULTS: Complete osseous consolidation was visible in nine, partial consolidation ({\textgreater}30 {\%}) in four, and lysis in one patient, without any significant differences between ventral only or dorsoventral approach. After removal of the fixateur interne the level of consolidation improved in all patients, treated dorsoventrally. There was no significant correlation between percentage of osseous consolidation and the clinical follow-up parameters. After 6 years, 71 {\%} of the patients suffered from persistent pain associated with the approach to the iliac crest. Two revision surgeries have been necessary. CONCLUSION: High rates of osseous consolidation are visible 6 years after ventral spondylodesis by iliac crest bone grafts. A further improvement of consolidation can be expected after dorsal implant removal. But the surgical approach to the iliac crest is accompanied with a relevant complication rate.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) components have an orderly sequence  of rupture. However, it is still unclear how many structures have to be damaged to consider it disrupted. We aim to establish imaging criteria, which can define the complex as competent or incompetent. METHODS: Prospective study of 74 consecutive vertebral acute traumatic fractures, using X-rays and MRI scan (FS-T2-w/STIR sequences). We analyzed the association between MRI signal (intact, edema, disruption) of each PLC component-facet capsules (FC), interspinous ligaments (ISL), supraspinous ligaments (SSL) and ligamentum flavum (LF)-and the variables: AO/TLICS classification, treatment, surgical findings, interspinous diastasis index (IDI), local kyphosis (LVK) and ISS (TLICS) score. chi2 test and U Mann-Whitney were used for statistics. RESULTS: MR images of ISL edema correlated surgically with intact ligaments or laxity, and were associated with 87.5{\%} of facet distraction, LVK: 11.6 masculine, IDI: 1.2. Images of ISL, SSL or LF disruptions showed in all cases ruptures under surgical examination. Images of SSL disruption associated with LVK: 14.5 masculine, IDI: 1.8. Images of ISL disruption associated with SSL/LF rupture, LVK: 16 masculine, and IDI: 2; while LF disruption showed LVK: 18 masculine, IDI: 1.9. When comparing "competent PLC" (images of facet distraction and ISL edema) with "incompetent PLC" (images of SSL disruption +/- ISL or LF disruption) the latest showed more severe scores in every variable (p {\textless} 0.001), except neurologic status. CONCLUSION: Following PLC rupture sequence, ISL edema with facet distraction seems not to be enough to define a posterior tension band incompetence. It is the further step of SSL rupture what gives the key to PLC incompetence.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy and safety  for a posterior-approach circumferential decompression and shortening reconstruction with a titanium mesh cage for lumbar burst fractures. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Surgical decompression and reconstruction for severely unstable lumbar burst fractures requires an anterior or combined anteroposterior approach. Furthermore, anterior instrumentation for the lower lumbar is restricted through the presence of major vessels. METHODS: Three patients with an L1 burst fracture, one with an L3 and three with an L4 (5 men, 2 women; mean age, 65.0 years) who underwent circumferential decompression and shortening reconstruction with a titanium mesh cage through a posterior approach alone and a 4-year follow-up were evaluated regarding the clinical and radiological course. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 277 minutes. Mean blood loss was 471 ml. In 6 patients, the Frankel score improved more than one grade after surgery, and the remaining patient was at Frankel E both before and after surgery. Mean preoperative visual analogue scale was 7.0, improving to 0.7 postoperatively. Local kyphosis improved from 15.7 degrees before surgery to -11.0 degrees after surgery. In 3 cases regarding the mid to lower lumbar patients, local kyphosis increased more than 10 degrees by 3 months following surgery, due to subsidence of the cages. One patient developed severe tilting and subsidence of the cage, requiring additional surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results concerning this small series suggest the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of this treatment for unstable lumbar burst fractures. This technique from a posterior approach alone offers several advantages over traditional anterior or combined anteroposterior approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Universal Clamp (UC) is a novel vertebral anchor consisting of a  sublaminar polyester band connected to fusion rods by a titanium jaw locked with a screw. The authors prospectively studied patients treated for thoracic or lumbar burst fractures with short pedicle screw constructs reinforced with UCs to prevent screw pullout. METHODS: Eleven patients below 18 years of age underwent 2-stage circumferential fusion for complete burst fractures (Magerl A 3.3). Two pedicle screws reinforced by 2 UCs were inserted in the vertebra proximal to the fracture and 2 pedicle screws reinforced by 2 UCs were inserted in the vertebra distal to the fracture. Within 7 days, cages filled with cancellous bone graft were added for anterior column support. T12 was fractured in 3 patients, L1 in 4, L3 in 2, and L4 in 2 patients. Preoperatively, 10 patients were neurologically intact (Frankel E) and 1 patient had an incomplete spinal cord injury (Frankel C). RESULTS: Mean operative duration for the posterior and anterior procedures was 110+/-24 and 120+/-35 minutes, respectively. Average intraoperative blood loss was 355+/-60 mL. Mean hospital stay was 11+/-2 days and follow-up averaged 36.1+/-5 months. Mean kyphotic deformity was corrected from 25+/-9 to 5.3+/-4.5 degrees postoperatively (79{\%}), without subsequent loss of correction (P=0.17). Regional kyphosis improved by 20+/-8 degrees postoperatively, without subsequent loss of correction (P=0.09). No intraoperative complication was observed. There was no neurological deterioration. The patient who had a Frankel C lesion recovered 1 Frankel level (Frankel D) at final follow-up. None of the patients exhibited significant correction loss during follow-up, and there was no pseudarthrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic and lumbar complete burst fractures in skeletally immature patients can be treated using anterior bone graft cages and posterior instrumented fusion augmented with UCs to prevent pedicle screw pullout. With these constructs, which are short to preserve mobile intervertebral segments, kyphosis was corrected, fusion achieved, and correction maintained in all subjects without neurological worsening. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the improved method and effectiveness of posterior pedicle-screw fixation combined with restoring and grafting through the injured vertebrae for treating thoracolumbar burst fracture. METHODS: Between March 2008 and September 2010, 21 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture were treated by posterior pedicle-screw fixation combined with restoring and grafting through the injured vertebrae. Of 21 cases, 15 were male and 6 were female with an age range of 20-61 years (mean, 38.4 years). Affected segments included T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 7 cases, L2 in 5 cases, and T12-L1 in 4 cases. According to Frankel classification for neurological function, 2 cases were rated as grade A, 4 cases as grade B, 6 cases as grade C, 5 cases as grade D, and 4 cases as grade E; based on Denis classification, all 21 cases were burst fractures, including 7 cases of type A, 11 cases of type B, and 3 cases of type C. The X-ray film was taken to measure the relative height of fractured vertebrae and Cobb's angle, and the function of the spinal cord was evaluated at preoperation, postoperation, and last follow-up. RESULTS: All the incisions healed primarily. The 21 patients were followed up 12-30 months (mean, 26 months). No loosening or breakage of screws and rods occurred. X-ray films showed good bone healing with the healing time from 12 to 23 months (mean, 16 months). The Cobb's angles at 1 week and 1 year postoperatively were (3.4 +/- 2.4) degrees and (5.2 +/- 3.2) degrees respectively, showing significant differences when compared with preoperative angle (22.1 +/- 1.2) degrees (P {\textless} 0.05), while no significant difference between 1 week and 1 year after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The anterior height of injured vertebrae recovered from (14.6 +/- 2.1) mm (40.2{\%} +/- 1.5{\%} of the normal) at preoperation to (36.0 +/- 2.0) mm (95.3{\%} +/- 1.3{\%} of the normal) at 1 week, and to (35.0 +/- 2.4) mm (94.4{\%} +/- 2.5{\%} of the normal) at 1 year; significant differences were found between preoperation and postoperation (P {\textless} 0.05), while no significant difference between 1 week and 1 year after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At 1 year after operation, the Frankel neurological function grade was improved in varying degrees, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative grade (chi2 = 11.140, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Improved method of posterior pedicle-screw fixation combined with restoring and grafting through the injured vertebrae in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture can reconstruct the anterior and middle column stability and prevent loss of Cobb's angle and height of vertebrae.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early clinical outcomes of subtotal corpectomy and intervertebral bone grafting through posterior approach alone in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture or thoracolumbar fracture-dislocation. METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2010, 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture or thoracolumbar fracture dislocation were treated with subtotal corpectomy and intervertebral bone grafting through posterior approach alone. There were 14 males and 6 females, with an average age of 36.1 years (range, 19-47 years). Fractures were caused by falling from height in 12 cases, traffic accident in 6 cases, and crushing in 2 cases. According to AO classification, there were 10 cases of A3 type, 8 cases of B2 type, and 2 cases of C2 type. Single segment was involved in 8 cases, double segments in 12 cases. Twelve cases complicated by fracture dislocation and 6 cases by lateral displacement. All patients had bones occupancy in vertebral canal. The preoperative Cobb angle was (30.2 +/- 3.9) degrees. According to Frankel classification for neurological function, there were 4 cases of grade B, 9 cases of grade C, and 7 cases of grade D at preoperation. The mean time between injury and operation was 4.5 days (range, 1-12 days). RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention, and no infection occurred. Twenty patients were followed up 8-16 months (mean, 12 months). The interbody fusion time was 6-9 months (mean, 7 months). Neurological function recovered 1 to 3 grades: 1 case of grade C, 2 cases of grade D, 17 cases of grade E at last follow-up. The Cobb angle was (6.5 +/- 4.2) degrees at last follow-up, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative value (t = 2.39, P = 0.00). No breaking or loosening of screw and implant sinkage occurred. CONCLUSION: A combination of subtotal corpectomy and intervertebral bone grafting through posterior approach alone has the advantages of complete decompression, restoration of spinal stability, restoration of vertebral body height, high bone healing rate, and good recovery of neurological function. However, this surgical technique has a relatively large amount of blood loss and high requirements for surgeons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of spinal fractures varies from 1{\%} to 17{\%} in alpine skiing injuries. Distinctions have been made regarding the differences in the mechanisms of injury and fracture types between skiing and snowboarding. Although fracture patterns have been described, there have not been any detailed descriptions of the specific fracture types and subgroups. PURPOSE: To address the patterns of spinal fractures associated with these sports and to determine the incidence of various fracture groups and subgroups as well as to determine whether the fracture patterns differ between skiing and snowboarding injuries. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures associated with either skiing or snowboarding over a period of 5 years. The injuries were classified according to the AO Comprehensive Classification. In addition, isolated transverse process fractures and isolated spinous process fractures were included. Cervical spine fractures were excluded from this study. RESULTS: There were a total of 119 patients with thoracic and lumbar fractures that were identified after 1,283,348 skiing/snowboarding days. There were a total of 146 fractures, of which 114 were classified according to the AO Comprehensive Classification, with the remaining fractures (n = 32) consisting of isolated transverse or spinous process fractures. The preponderance of these injuries (94.7{\%}) was compression injuries. Burst fractures (A3.1 and A3.2) made up 23{\%}, and simple compression fractures (A1.1, A1.2, and A1.3) made up 71{\%} of the total. Distraction injuries composed only 4.4{\%}, and rotation injuries composed 0.9{\%} of the total. The snowboarders incurred only compression fractures, whereas the 5 distraction injuries and the 1 rotational injury were noted only in the skier population. There were no patients with neurological deficits in this review. Fourteen skiers (14{\%}) and 10 snowboarders (8{\%}) were found to have isolated transverse process fractures. All 6 isolated spinous process fractures (4{\%} of all fractures) were in the thoracic spine. CONCLUSION: Thoracic and lumbar fractures caused by skiing and snowboarding are mainly stable injuries, composed of either compression fractures, mostly simple compression injuries, or isolated transverse and spinous process fractures. Neurological injury was not seen in this study.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Percutaneous in situ contouring is based on bilateral bending of rods on the spine, thus increasing lordosis at the fracture. It was analyzed if this technique would provide a better reduction than prone positioning and how sagittal alignment would behave. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were operated using in situ contouring and selective anterior fusion for non-neurologic A2, A3 or B2 fractures. Clinical results were assessed prospectively using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The radiographic deformity correction was measured by sagittal index and regional kyphosis. Sagittal balance was assessed using kyphosis, lordosis, T9 tilt, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt and sacral slope. Posterior wall fragment reduction was evaluated by computed tomography. RESULTS: After 2 years, VAS and ODI were comparable to the status prior to the accident. The sagittal index was 19.7 degrees preoperatively, 5.3 degrees after prone positioning and -1.1 degrees after in situ contouring (p {\textless} 0.001). The loss of correction was 2.4 degrees , mainly during the first 3 months. Similar observations were made for regional kyphosis. The sagittal spino-pelvic alignment was stable postoperatively. A preoperative canal obstruction {\textgreater}/=50 {\%} was observed in 16 patients, and the fragments migrated anteriorly in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous instrumentation and anterior fusion provides good clinical results. In situ contouring increases lordosis obtained by prone positioning. Anterior column lengthening and ligamentotaxis reduce posterior wall fragments, which decompress the canal without laminectomy. The fusion of anterior defects prevents the loss of correction and provides a stable sagittal profile. The instrumentation may be removed without damaging the paravertebral muscles and loss of correction.},

abstract = {AIM: The purpose of the study was to assess the stability provided by an ilio-iliac dorsal plate fixation technique using an AO narrow DCP on the pelvic brim in vertically and rotationally unstable type-C pelvic ring injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 12 fresh cadaver pelvises in a single limb stance load. A type-C pelvic ring injury (a type I lateral sacral fracture in the classification of Denis with symphysis pubis rupture) was performed on the cadaver specimen and fixed with a four-hole narrow dynamic compression plate to stabilize the symphysis pubis rupture; the sacrum fracture was stabilized either anteriorly with two 3-hole reconstruction plates ("anterior plate osteosynthesis") or with a posterior fixation using a 12-hole narrow DCP. A cyclic load of between 100 and 250 N was applied to the fifth lumbar vertebra of the specimen. An extensometer was attached to both sides of the sacrum fracture to detect movements at the fracture site. RESULTS: We were able to achieve usable measurements in nine specimens. Three measurements were performed on each specimen, and the movements recorded at the fracture gap in trans-sacral plate fixation were higher than or similar to those observed for anterior plate synthesis in 23 out of 27 cases. CONCLUSION: Dorsal ilio-iliac bridge plate fixation provides somewhat reduced stability compared to anterior plate fixation, but the difference is not significant.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical magnetic resonance imaging study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the differences in the position of the aorta relative to the spine in patients with single right thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (RT-AIS) in 2 different body positions (supine and prone). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screws are used widely in scoliosis surgery. With an increase in the incidence of vascular complications that result from misplaced pedicle screws, studies regarding the spatial relationship of the aorta and the vertebral body have also gradually increased and show that the aorta is positioned more posteriorly in patients with RT-AIS than in normal subjects. In these imaging studies, the patients received computed tomographic or magnetic resonance (MR) scans in the supine position. Recent studies of subjects without a spinal deformity found that the aorta moves from a posterolateral to an anteromedial position when the subject changes from a supine position to a prone position. However, no studies investigated aorta shifting with changing body position in patients with AIS. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with single RT-AIS were recruited into this study. Each patient received an axial MR scan from T5 through L3 in both the supine and prone positions. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the left pedicle-aorta (LtP-Ao) angle, LtP-Ao distance, and vertebral rotation angle were measured from T5 through L3 in the axial plane MR images. We also simulated misplacement of the pedicle screw with commonly used length and 20 degrees direction error, and the potential risk of aorta impingement was defined as the virtual pedicle screw crossing the aorta. The paired sample t test was used to compare these parameters between the 2 body positions. RESULTS: The mean LtP-Ao angle and mean LtP-Ao distance differed between the body positions at each level. At the T5-T10 levels, the patients in the prone position exhibited significantly smaller LtP-Ao angles (26.2 degrees vs. 38.8 degrees ; P, 0.01) and distances (27.0 vs. 30.7 mm; P, 0.01) than those in the supine position. The vertebral rotation angle was larger in the prone position than in the supine position at periapical levels, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P . 0.05). The percentage of potential risk of aorta impingement was significantly higher in the prone position than in the supine position at the T5-T10 levels (19.7{\%} vs. 6.6{\%}, respectively; P, 0.05). CONCLUSION.: The aorta shifts more anteromedially and more closely to the spine at the T5-T10 levels when patients with RT-AIS change from the supine to the prone position. Thus, in the prone position, the aorta is potentially at a higher risk for injury from anterior and lateral cortex penetration by the left pedicle screws. The spinal surgeon should be aware of these altered conditions to avoid injury to the aorta during pedicle screw insertion in patients with RT-AIS who are in the prone position.},

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 32 patients with thoracolumbar fractures underwent surgical procedure of pedicle screws fixation at the level of the fracture and monosegment bone graft simultaneously from January 2006 to December 2008. All the patients were followed up more than two years. There were 25 males and 7 females with an average age of 39.1 years (ranged, 25 to 60 years). According to the AO classification, type A1.3 was in 5 cases, type A3.1 in 17, type A3.3 in 8, type C1.1 in 1, and type C1.3 in 1. Load scoring was from 4 to 7 points with average of 5.8 points. The spinal cord function according to Frankel grade, grade A was in 2 cases, grade B in 2, grade C in 5, grade D in 9 and grade E in 14. Cobb angle, the height of anterior border of vertebral body, spinal canal stenosis rate were observed by X-ray films. Meanwhile, pain and work ability were evaluated by Denis scale. RESULTS: All the patients were followed-up from 30 to 48 months (averaged, 39.2 months). No internal fixation loosening or breakage were found. Three cases occurred with floating callus and other obtained well bone fusion. Compared with preoperation, Cobb angle, the height of anterior border of vertebral body, and spinal canal stenosis rate improved obviously (P {\textless} 0.05); but Cobb angle had lost partially at the last follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Meanwhile, anterosuperior part of vertebral body of 25 cases existed cavity phenomenon. The nerve function of all cases recovered for 1-2 grades, except for 2 cases without change whose spinal cord function was degree A preoperatively. According to Denis scale, lower back pain scoring, P1 was in 22 cases, P2 in 7, P3 in 3; state of work scoring, W1 was in 18 cases, W2 in 8, W3 in 3, W5 in 3. CONCLUSION: It can help to correct the kyphosis and improve low back pain in thoracolumbar fractures through pedicle screws fixation at the level of the fracture and monosegment bone graft simultaneously, but it can not improve the cavity phenomenon of injured vertebral body and avoid partially lost of Cobb angle.},

The pathologies, clinical characteristics, preoperative and postoperative radiological findings, surgical techniques, and instrumentation for seven patients operated on between 1998 and 2009 are presented in this article. Biopsies were performed on all patients except those involving trauma. Patients were followed up at three-month intervals in the first year, at 6-month intervals in the second year, and on a regular basis afterward. One patient had a traumatic L5 burst fracture; the other six had tumoral pathologies in the L5 vertebrae. One tumoral lesion was a chordoma, another was a hemangioma, and the remaining four were metastatic lesions. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were performed for the metastatic tumor patients during the postoperative period. Patients with renal cancer and chordoma survived for 3 years; patients with lung cancer and bladder cancer survived for 1 year; and patients with breast cancer survived for 16 months. The lumbosacral region presents significant stabilization problems because of the presence of sacral slope. In our opinion, if the lesion involves only the L5 vertebra, anterior cage-filled bone cement or bone graft should be performed, as dictated by the pathology and posterior transpedicular instrumentation. If the lesion involves the L4 vertebra or the sacrum and the L5 vertebra, the instrumentation can be extended to cover other segments with sacral attachments. The present cases involved only L5 vertebra and treatment with short-segment stabilization covering the anterior and posterior columns.},

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess  the usefulness of posterior instrumentation without fusion in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar and lumbar unstable burst fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 60 patients who received only posterior instrumentation without fusion for thoracolumbar and lumbar unstable burst fracture between September 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009 at our hospital and who were available for longer than 12-month follow-up observation after the implant removal. For clinical evaluation, 12 months after the implant removal, we used the Oswestry Disability Index, the Visual Analog Scale of back pain, and the Smiley-Webster Scale. RESULTS: In comparison with preoperative conditions, the postoperative kyphotic angle and the ratio of anterior vertebra height were significantly increased (P=0.005, 0.007) and they were maintained even after implant removal. The average range of joint motion was 9.47+/-1.85 degrees, 1.77+/-0.99 Visual Analog Scale, and 0.78+/-3.46 Oswestry Disability Index, and scores greater than "good" on the Smiley-Webster Scale were observed in 50 of the 60 patients.

METHODS: From September 2007 to December 2009, 74 cases who underwent posterior short-segment fixation for single level thoracolumbar burst fractures (Denis burst fracture type A, B, C) without spinal injury were analyzed retrospectively. There were 53 male and 21 female, mean age was (39 +/- 15) years. Neither of them treated with direct decompression, grafting or fusion. Changes in the anterior vertebral height ratio, vertebral wedge angle, Cobb angle, regional angle were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, before implant removal, and at final follow-up to find the statistic difference. Pain status and work status were evaluated using Denis criterion. The incidence of incision infection, screw breakage, iatrogenic spinal injury were recorded as well. RESULTS: The time of follow-up was (20 +/- 11) months, no significant change was noted in anterior vertebral height ratio and vertebral wedge angle (P {\textgreater} 0.05). A significant loss was noted in Cobb angle and regional angle, which were 9.8 degrees +/- 5.1 degrees and 9.1 degrees +/- 4.8 degrees respectively (t = 2.48 and 3.41, P {\textless} 0.05). Comparing with the patients with Cobb angle {\textgreater} 20 degrees , the patients with Cobb angle {\textless}/= 20 degrees had better pain scale rate (chi(2) = 4.16, P = 0.04) and work scale rate (chi(2) = 24.34, P {\textless} 0.01). There were incision infection in 1 case, screw breakage in 1, screw loose in 1, and no iatrogenic spinal injury.

RESULTS: The presented method resulted in fracture morphology, found in clinical classification systems like the Magerl classification. In the calf spine samples, 70{\%} displayed incomplete burst fractures corresponding to type A3.1 and A3.2 fractures. In all human samples, superior incomplete burst fractures (Magerl A3.1) were identified by an independent radiologist and spine surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: The presented set up enables the first experimental means to reliably model and study distinct incomplete burst fracture patterns in an in vitro setting. Thus, we envisage this protocol to facilitate further studies on spine fracture treatment of incomplete burst fractures.},

The surgical results using this technique are reviewed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six patients suffering thoracolumbar and lumbar fracture using a crescent-shaped PMMA strut combined with fixation for reconstruction of the anterior spinal column. Postoperative radiographic, included plain x-ray and 3-D computed tomography (CT) imaging, evaluated fusion status postoperatively. Pain relief and neurological status was assessed by comparing Frankel Score and Vision Analogue Score (VAS) pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: All six patients achieved immediate stabilization. No patient needs additional posterior instrumentation stabilization due to loss of sagittal alignment and kyphosis deformity. All patients achieved significant relief of back pain, improvement of neurological function, correction of preoperative deformity and excellent bone fusion results documented on plain x-rays and 3-D CT reconstruction imaging. There were no complications of neurological worsening, wound infection, subsidence and dislodgement of PMMA strut, or anterior instrumentation failure during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: The crescent-shaped PMMA strut is an alternative for anterior spinal reconstruction and fusion in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture.

A solid bony fusion was seen on CT scans on the AB side in all patients and on the BAG side in five patients, and a partial fusion in five patients, resulting in a total fusion-rate of 71{\%} of all fused segments in the BAG group. CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term results show that BAG-S54P4 bone graft material is safe to be used as a bone graft extender in spine surgery.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Minimizing the number of vertebral levels involved in fusion of a spine fracture is a common goal of internal fixation. This is achievable by utilizing traditional short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF). However, in SSPF there is reported up to a 54{\%} incidence of instrument failure or unfavorable clinical outcome. Short-segment posterior fixation with pedicle fixation at the level of the fracture (short same-segment fixation) suggests biomechanical advantages toward maintenance of kyphosis correction and reducing failure rates. However its clinical efficacy is largely unknown. METHODS: The team conducted a retrospective review of 25 thoracolumbar burst fracture patients who were treated with short same-segment fixation between September 2005 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was incidence of reoperation and loss of kyphosis correction within the follow-up period. Long-term functional status and pain was also assessed. RESULTS: Average duration of the most recent follow-up was 21.64 months (range 3 to 42 months). Two patients (8{\%}) required reoperation due to either hardware failure or pseudoarthrosis. Mean pre-operative kyphosis was 14.49 degrees . Average post-operative kyphosis was -0.74 degrees (lordosis). Average follow-up kyphosis of all cases was 10.78 degrees . Excluding failures, average follow-up kyphosis was 8.67 degrees . A mean of 15.23 degrees of kyphosis correction was attained from pre-operation to post-operation (P {\textless} 0.0001). Average loss of kyphosis correction from immediate post-operation to most recent follow-up was -11.51 degrees and -9.51 excluding the two failures (P {\textless} 0.0001). Average pre-operative to most-recent follow-up kyphosis correction was 3.72 degrees (P = 0.067) and 5.51 degrees excluding failures (P = 0.0024). At initial one-month follow-up, average disability score was 52.63{\%} (range 16{\%} to 84{\%}). At most recent follow-up, average disability score was 5.5{\%} (range 0{\%} to 16{\%}). One patient was lost to long-term follow-up. Mean difference from one-month follow-up to most recent follow-up (excluding failures) was 47.27{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Short same-segment fixation decreases implantation failure rate and reoperation rate compared to traditional SSPF, however long-term kyphosis correction was not maintained. Despite this loss of kyphosis correction, clinical pain and disability improved at long-term follow-up.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We report our experience and literature review concerning surgical treatment of neurological burst fractures of the fifth lumbar vertebra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with L5 neurological burst fractures were consecutively enrolled; 6 patients had complete motor deficits, and 12 had sphincter dysfunction. We performed 18 posterior and one combined approaches. To avoid kyphosis, posterior internal fixation was achieved by positioning patients on the operating table with hips and knees fully extended. At the latest follow-up (mean 22 months, range 10-66), neurological recovery, canal remodeling and L4-S1 angle were evaluated. RESULTS: Vertebral body replacement was difficult, which therefore resulted in an oblique position of the cage. Vertebral bodies still remained deformed, even though fixation allowed for an acceptable profile (22 degrees , range 20-35). We observed three cases of paralysis, five complete, and three incomplete recoveries. In the remaining eight patients, sphincter impairment was the only finding. In 15 patients, pain was absent or occasional; in four individuals, it was continuous but not invalidating. Remodeling was visible by X-ray and/or CT, without significant secondary stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The L5 burst fractures are rare and mostly due to axial compression. Cauda and/or nerve root injuries are absolute indications for surgery. If an anterior approach is technically difficult, laminectomy can allow for decompression, and it can be easily combined with transpedicular screw fixation. Posterior instrumented fusion, also performed with the aim to restore sagittal profile, when associated with an accurate spinal canal exploration and decompression, may be looked at as an optimal treatment for neurological L5 burst fractures.},

abstract = {The clinical use of niacin to treat dyslipidemic conditions is limited by noxious side effects, most commonly facial flushing. In mice, niacin-induced flushing results from COX-1-dependent formation of PGD(2) and PGE(2) followed by COX-2-dependent production of PGE(2). Consistent with this, niacin-induced flushing in humans is attenuated when niacin is combined with an antagonist of the PGD(2) receptor DP1. NSAID-mediated suppression of COX-2-derived PGI(2) has negative cardiovascular consequences, yet little is known about the cardiovascular biology of PGD(2). Here, we show that PGD(2) biosynthesis is augmented during platelet activation in humans and, although vascular expression of DP1 is conserved between humans and mice, platelet DP1 is not present in mice. Despite this, DP1 deletion in mice augmented aneurysm formation and the hypertensive response to Ang II and accelerated atherogenesis and thrombogenesis. Furthermore, COX inhibitors in humans, as well as platelet depletion, COX-1 knockdown, and COX-2 deletion in mice, revealed that niacin evoked platelet COX-1-derived PGD(2) biosynthesis. Finally, ADP-induced spreading on fibrinogen was augmented by niacin in washed human platelets, coincident with increased thromboxane (Tx) formation. However, in platelet-rich plasma, where formation of both Tx and PGD(2) was increased, spreading was not as pronounced and was inhibited by DP1 activation. Thus, PGD(2), like PGI(2), may function as a homeostatic response to thrombogenic and hypertensive stimuli and may have particular relevance as a constraint on platelets during niacin therapy.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate long-term stabilizing healing effectiveness and influence on adjacent intact vertebral bodies of a new injectable partly resorbable calcium sulfate (60 wt.{\%})/hydroxyapatite (40 wt.{\%}) bone substitute employed in vertebral augmentation of osteoporotic collapses. METHODS: From April 2009 to April 2011, 80 patients underwent vertebral augmentation. Patient enrolment criteria are as follows: age more than 20 years; symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture from low energy trauma encompassing level T5 to L1 and classified as A1.1 to A1.2 according to the AO classification system; vertebral height compression within 0-75{\%} compared to the posterior (dorsal) wall; client history confirming the age of the compression fracture to be within at least 4 weeks; and patients who are able to understand the procedure and participate in the study. Preoperative and postoperative imaging studies consisted of computed tomography, plain X-ray, dual X-ray absorptiometry scanning, and magnetic resonance. Pain intensity has been evaluated by an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS), and physical and quality of life compromise assessments have been evaluated by Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI). All procedures have been performed fluoroscopically guided by left unilateral approach under local anesthesia and mild sedation. RESULTS: VAS-based pain trend over 12-month follow-up has shown a statistical significant (p {\textless} 0.001) decrease, starting from 7.68 (SD 1.83) preoperatively with an immediate first day decrease at 3.51 (SD 2.16) and 0.96 (SD 0.93) at 12 months. The ODI score dropped significantly from 54.78{\%} to 20.12{\%} at 6 months. None device-related complication has been reported. In no case, a new incidental adjacent fracture has been reported. CONCLUSION: Data show how this injectable partly resorbable ceramic cement could be a nontoxic and lower stiffness alternative to polymethylmethacrylate for immediate and long-term stabilization of osteoporotic collapsed vertebral bodies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are common, and can occur concomitantly in patients with symptomatic degenerative stenosis. Less commonly, complicated vertebral body fractures may involve retropulsion of bone into the spinal canal, resulting in stenosis with myelopathy and/or radiculopathy. Decompression of the neural elements can lead to destabilization and progressive kyphotic deformity. Laminectomy combined with open vertebroplasty provides a way to decompress the neural elements and stabilize the anterior columns in patients who cannot tolerate extended surgical time or complications associated with instrumentation and fusion. The authors describe the combination of decompressive laminectomy and open transpedicular vertebroplasty as a means to decompress neural elements and simultaneously stabilize the anterior vertebral column. METHODS: Forty-one patients with a total of 51 thoracolumbar fractures were included in this retrospective case review. A decompressive laminectomy was performed first, followed by vertebroplasty using an open transpedicular approach. For subjective assessment of outcome, the patients were assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire and additional questions pertaining to the patient's condition. RESULTS: Out of 51 fractures, there were 15 burst fractures and 36 compression fractures. Fracture levels ranged from T12 to S1. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 0.5-60 months). The mean post-operative Oswestry score was 16 (range, 0-39), and all patients except for one were subjectively pleased with the results of the procedure and said they would recommend it to others. All patients were able to return to all routine activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' cases indicate combining open decompressive laminectomies with vertebroplasty can be an effective treatment for patients with complicated thoracic and lumbar fractures without involving bone fusion or spinal instrumentation and with good long-term outcomes.},

@article{Prasarn2012,
abstract = {OBJECT: The proper prehospital and inpatient management of patients with unstable spinal injuries is critical for prevention of secondary neurological compromise. The authors sought to analyze the amount of motion generated in the unstable thoracolumbar spine during various maneuvers and transfers that a trauma patient would typically be subjected to prior to definitive fixation. METHODS: Five fresh cadavers with surgically created unstable L-1 burst fractures were tested. The amount of angular motion between the T-12 and L-2 vertebral segments was measured using a 3D electromagnetic motion analysis device. A complete sequence of maneuvers and transfers was then performed that a patient would be expected to go through from the time of injury until surgical fixation. These maneuvers and transfers included spine board placement and removal, bed transfers, lateral therapy, and turning the patient prone onto the operating table. During each of these, the authors performed what they believed to be the most commonly used versus the best techniques for preventing undesirable motion at the injury level. RESULTS: When placing a spine board there was more motion in all 3 planes with the log-roll technique, and this difference reached statistical significance for axial rotation (p = 0.018) and lateral bending (p = 0.003). Using logrolling for spine board removal resulted in increased motion again, and this was statistically significant for flexion-extension (p = 0.014). During the bed transfer and lateral therapy, the log-roll technique resulted in more motion in all 3 planes (p {\textless}/= 0.05). When turning the cadavers prone for surgery there was statistically more angular motion in each plane for manually turning the patient versus the Jackson table turn (p {\textless}/= 0.01). The total motion was decreased by almost 50{\%} in each plane when using an alternative to the log-roll techniques during the complete sequence (p {\textless}/= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Although it is unknown how much motion in the unstable spine is necessary to cause secondary neurological injury, the accepted tenet is to minimize motion as much as possible. This study has demonstrated the angular motion incurred by the unstable thoracolumbar spine as experienced by the typical trauma patient from the field to positioning in the operating room using the best and most commonly used techniques. As previously reported, using the log-roll technique consistently results in unwanted motion at the injured spinal segment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of transpedicular screw fixation in neurological recovery and pain control in thoracolumbar junction injuries. METHOD: This audit was carried out in the Neurosurgery Department of Postgraduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar from November 2008 to April 2010. Written informed consent was taken from all patients. Detail history, clinical examination, x-ray dorsolumbar spine (or CT scan dorsolumbar spine) and MRI dorsolumbar spine were done in all cases. Neurological status was assessed using the Frankel grading for spinal cord injury. Post traumatic unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures were included in this study. Open fractures, fractures with significant kyphotic deformity, fractures with anterior retropulsed fragments, multiple level fractures requiring long segment fixation, pedicles fractures and pathological fractures were excluded from study. The short-segment transpedicular fixation was performed in all patients. Effect of transpedicular screw fixation on pain relief was measured by improvement in Dennis pain scale. History of pain relief and neurological assessments of patients were done on each follow up visit. The data was analyzed in SPSS 16.0. RESULTS: Transpedicular screw fixation was performed in 80 patients including 55 males and 25 females. Mean age was 35 +/- 6.75 years (range 15-61 years). The level of injuries were D11 = 6 (7{\%}) cases, D12 = 13 (16{\%}) cases, L1 = 40 (50{\%}) cases, L2 = 15 (19{\%}) cases, D12 {\&} L1 = 6 (8{\%}) cases. There were 43 (54{\%}) Wedge fractures, 9 (11{\%}) fracture subluxations, burst fracture in 14 (17{\%}), translational injuries in 8 (10{\%}) while distraction injuries in 6 (8{\%}) cases. Pre operative neurological status according to Frankel grading was: grade A, 48 (60{\%}) cases, grade B 12 (15{\%}) cases, grade C 6 (7{\%}) cases, grade D 4 (5{\%}) cases and grade E 10 (13{\%}) cases. Six months post operatively, there were 16 (20{\%}) cases in grade A, grade B 34 (42.5{\%}) cases, grade C 16 (20{\%}) cases, grade D 4 (5{\%}) cases and grade E 10 (12.5{\%}) cases. Pain control was assessed by improvement in Dennis pain scale. Pre operatively there was no patient in P1, 4 (5{\%}) patients in P2, 16 (20{\%}) in P3, 24 (30{\%}) in P4 and 36 (45{\%}) in P5. Six months later there were 56 (70{\%}) patients in P1,16 (20{\%}) in P2, 4 (5{\%}) in P3 and 4 (5{\%}) patients in P4.There was no patient in P5. CONCLUSION: Thoracolumbar junction injuries are common in young male patients. Transpedicular screw fixation is useful choice for achieving better neurological recovery and good pain control in traumatic thoracolumbar fractures.},

OBJECTIVE: To correlate the Interpedicular distance (IPD) to the percentage of narrowing of the spinal canal and to the presence of neurological deficit and laminar fracture in thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several reports use radiographic findings such as severity of vertebrae collapse, comminution of the vertebral body, and grade of localized kyphosis to determine the severity of spinal traumas and establish appropriate management. However, the importance of the IPD in burst fractures has rarely been mentioned, and no report specifically describes the correlation between an increased IPD and the severity of the lesion or a higher occurrence of lamina fractures. METHODS: Plain radiographs of 260 patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures were studied. The percentage of widening between the pedicles of the fractured vertebra (IPD) was established by comparing this distance with that of the vertebrae immediately above and below. Data concerning neurological status, percentage of narrowing of the spinal canal, and the presence of laminar fracture were correlated to the IPD. RESULTS: A significant correlation between IPD and the percentage of narrowing of the spinal canal was found (r = 0.39; t = 6.78; P = 0.00). IPD was significantly increased in patients with neurological deficit (24.7{\%} +/- 12.6{\%}) and in patients with lamina fractures (24.6{\%} +/- 16.2{\%}). CONCLUSION: IPD measured from plain radiographs proved to be a reliable instrument to assess narrowing of the spinal canal, neurological deficits, and laminar fractures.},

Cement augmentation of the pedicle screws in order to improve the screw's holding power in osteoporotic bone and to reduce postoperative loss of reduction. Quick and painless postoperative mobilization without further bracing. INDICATIONS: Burst fractures (type A3 according to Magerl). Posttraumatic kyphosis following osteoporotic vertebral body fractures. Revision surgery after screw loosening. Type B and C fractures according to Magerl. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Osteoporotic fractures which are suitable for nonoperative treatment or percutaneous cement augmentation techniques (vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty). Vertebral body fractures in patients with good bone quality. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Insertion of pedicle screws in a typical manner. If perforated screws are used, cement application under fluoroscopic control via the central perforation of the screws. If pedicle screws without perforation are used, application of the cement using a Kyphoplasty technique and insertion of the screws. After hardening of the cement, completion of the instrumentation. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Mobilization starting on the first day after surgery. Avoidance of heavy lifting and manual labor for 3 months. Implant removal only if it is necessary due to complications. RESULTS: Between July 2008 and December 2009, 10 patients with osteoporotic vertebral body fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine were treated with cement-augmented posterior instrumentation. The mean age was 65.8 years (range 35-94 years). There were six type A (2 A1 and 4 A3 lesions) and four type B lesions (1 B1, 1 B2, and 2 B3 lesions) according to Magerl. Indications for cement augmentation of the pedicle screws were the patients' age (4 patients), osteoporosis with t scores {\textless} - 2.5 (2 patients), poor intraoperative screw hold (2 patients), and revision surgery after loosening of pedicle screws (2 patients). Cement leakage was observed in 5 patients with no further clinical relevance. Loosening of cement augmented pedicle screws occurred in 1 patient with a consecutive loss of reduction of 10 degrees . There was no need to remove any of the cement-augmented screws in the first 24 months.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the efficacy of lateral anterior decompression, internal fixation with Ventrofix and bone graft with titanic mesh in the treatment of severe thoracolumbar burst fracture. METHODS: From January 2008 to January 2010, 21 patients with severe thoracolumbar burst fracture were treated with lateral anterior decompression, internal fixation with Ventrofix, bone graft with titanic mesh. There were 15 males and 6 females, ranging in age from 21 to 46 years with an average of 32.2 years. Segment of fracture: 3 cases were in T11, 6 cases in T12, 7 cases in L1, 5 cases in L2. The mean kyphosis angle was 20.1 degrees and loading of fracture was 7.8 scores. Twenty-one cases accompany with incomplete paralysis. Nerves functions were observed according to Frankel grade; correction and maintain of kyphosis angle were observed by X-rays and CT. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up from 12 to 34 months with an average of 18.5 years. Postoperative complication including injury of pleura in 1 case, dynamic ileus in 2 cases, ilioinguinal nerve injury in 1 case, faulty union of wound in 1 case. All the above complications got recovery after symptomatic treatment. The mean kyphosis angle in fusional segment were 4.2 degrees and the rate of correction was 79{\%}. Nerves functions of all patients got improvement and no internal fixation fail, kyphosis angle obviously lost, titanium mesh shifting, loosening and breakage of screw were found at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Lateral anterior decompression, bone graft with titanic mesh, internal fixation with Ventrofix is an idea technique for severe thoracolumber burst fracture, but the method can not be used for patient with severity osteoporosis.},

abstract = {The roles of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in disc degeneration have not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in the endplate cells isolated from patients with degenerative disc disease and to see whether they are associated with the pathological change of endplate. Sixty-four degenerated lumbar endplate specimens were obtained from the patients with degenerative disc disease categorized as type Modic I or II in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 12 nondegenerative specimens as control (vertebra burst fracture patients without degenerative change in MRI) during surgical procedures. The expression of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 was examined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. A statistically significant increase in mRNA expression of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 was observed in the endplate cells in degenerative discs compared with nondegenerative discs. The corresponding protein levels of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 had the same expression patterns. Moreover, ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 down-regulated the expression of Col II, Sox9, and Col X the marker genes for chondrogenesis. Our results indicate that ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 appear to be potent negative regulators of endplate cartilage development.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics, classification, and treatment of thoracic fracture accompanied with sternum fracture. METHODS: Data of 32 patients with thoracic fractures accompanied with sternum fracture were reviewed. Patients information such as age, gender, cause of injury, site of sternum fracture, level and type of thoracic vertebral fracture, spinal cord injury and associated injuries was included in the analysis. Of the 32 patients, 13 had compressed fractures, 13 had fracture-dislocations, 5 had burst fracture and 1 had burst-dislocation. Six patients had a complete lesion of the spinal cord, 13 sustained a neurologically incomplete injury, and the other 13 were neurologically intact. Ten patients were treated nonoperatively and the other 22 surgically. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 10-103 months. Road traffic accidents and falling dominated among the causes. All patients were accompanied with other injuries. None of the 6 patients with a complete paralitic lesion regained any significant function. Of the 13 neurologically intact patients, 5 had local pain although 12 of them remained normal function. One patient showed tardive paralysis. Three of the 13 patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal, 5 regained some function and 5 did not recover. CONCLUSION: Thoracic fractures accompanied with sternum fracture are marked by violent force, severe fracture of the spine, severe injuries of the spinal cord, and high incidence of other injuries. The new classification method is more suitable to thoracic fractures accompanied with sternum fracture,and confirms the existence and clinical relevance of the 4th column of the thoracic spine and its role in providing spinal stability in patients with thoracic fracture.},

The hollow, porous, cylindrical nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 (n-HA/PA66) cage is a new nonmetallic cage device made by combining nanohydroxyapatite with polyamide 66. Few studies have examined its effectiveness and outcomes over a follow-up {\textgreater}2 years.We retrospectively studied 51 consecutive patients with acute traumatic thoracic or lumbar burst fracture who underwent anterior reconstruction with the n-HA/PA66 cage following single-level corpectomy. Radiologic parameters (radiographs and 3-dimensional computed tomography scans) preoperatively and at 1 week and {\textgreater}2 years postoperatively, as well as clinical outcome parameters (SF-36 scores), were analyzed. Mean kyphosis correction in the segment within the cage was 11.8 degrees +/-7.1 degrees , and mean loss of correction at last follow-up was 1.9 degrees +/-2.1 degrees . Osseous fusion was achieved in 90.2{\%} of patients, and severe cage subsidence (settling {\textgreater}2 mm) was observed in 19.6{\%} of patients at final follow-up. Significant differences were found in 7 of 8 health dimensions of the SF-36 between neurologically intact patients and neurologically injured patients. Our clinical results indicate that the n-HA/PA66 cage is an effective device for reconstruction after anterior thoracic and lumbar vertebral resection, resulting in a high rate of successful osseous fusion and a low proportion of severe cage subsidence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posterior fixation alone may not be adequate to achieve and maintain  burst fracture reduction. Adding screws in the fractured body may improve construct stiffness. This in vitro study evaluates the biomechanical effect of inserting pedicle screws in the fractured body compared with conventional short- and long-segment posterior fixation. METHODS: Stable and unstable L2 burst fractures were created in 8 calf spines (aged 18 weeks). Constructs were tested at 8 Nm in the intact state and then with instrumentation consisting of long- and short-segment posterior fixation with and without screws in the fractured L2 vertebral body after (1) stable burst fracture and (2) unstable burst fracture. Range of motion was recorded at L1-3 for flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated-measures analysis of variance, with significance set at P {\textless} .05. The data were normalized to the intact state (100{\%}). RESULTS: Both long- and short-segment constructs with screws in the fractured body significantly reduced motion compared with the stable and unstable burst fracture in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Fracture screws enhanced construct stability by 68{\%} (on average) relative to conventional short-segment posterior fixation and were comparable to long-segment posterior fixation. CONCLUSIONS: Screws at the fracture level improve construct stiffness. Short-segment constructs may suffice for stable burst fractures. More severe injuries may benefit from fracture screws and can be considered as an alternative treatment to long-segment constructs.},

abstract = {Lipoxins are formed by leukocytes during cell-cell interactions with epithelial or endothelial cells. Native lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) binds to the G protein-coupled lipoxin receptors formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2)/ALX and CysLT1. Furthermore, LXA(4) inhibits recruitment of neutrophils, by attenuating chemotaxis, adhesion, and transmigration across vascular endothelial cells. LXA(4) thus appears to serve as an endogenous "stop signal" for immune cell-mediated tissue injury (Serhan CN; Annu Rev Immunol 25: 101-137, 2007). The role of LXA(4) has not been addressed in salivary epithelium, and little is known about its effects on vascular endothelium. Here, we determined that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor activation in vascular endothelium and salivary epithelium upregulated the expression of adhesion molecules that facilitates the binding of immune cells. We hypothesize that the activation of the ALX/FPR2 and/or CysLT1 receptors by LXA(4) decreases this cytokine-mediated upregulation of cell adhesion molecules that enhance lymphocyte binding to both the vascular endothelium and salivary epithelium. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that nanomolar concentrations of LXA(4) blocked IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-mediated upregulation of E-selectin and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Binding of Jurkat cells to stimulated HUVECs was abrogated by LXA(4). Furthermore, LXA(4) preincubation with human submandibular gland cell line (HSG) also blocked TNF-alpha-mediated upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in these cells, and it reduced lymphocyte adhesion. These findings suggest that ALX/FPR2 and/or CysLT1 receptor activation in endothelial and epithelial cells blocks cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression and consequent binding of lymphocytes, a critical event in the pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome (SS).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: To evaluate the effect of critical time periods in vehicle protection on spine injuries in the Global War on Terror. PURPOSE: To characterize the effect of method of movement on and around the battlefield during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2001 to 2009 in terms of its impact on the incidence and severity of spinal fractures sustained in combat. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Mounted and dismounted American servicemembers who were injured during combat. METHODS: Extracted medical records of servicemembers identified in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry from October 2001 to December 2009. Methods of movement were defined as mounted or dismounted. Two time periods were compared. Cohorts were created for 2x2 analysis based on method of movement and the time period in which the injury occurred. Time period 1 and 2 were separated by April 1, 2007, which correlates with the initial fielding of the modern class of uparmored fighting vehicles with thickened underbelly armor and a V-shaped hull. Our four comparison groups were Dismounted in Time Period 1 (D1), Dismounted in Time Period 2 (D2), Mounted in Time Period 1 (M1), and Mounted in Time Period 2 (M2). RESULTS: In total, 1,819 spine fractures occurred over the entire study period. Four hundred seventy-two fractures (26{\%}) were sustained in 145 servicemembers who were mounted at the time of injury, and 1,347 (74{\%}) were sustained by 404 servicemembers who were dismounted (p{\textless}.0005). The incidence of fractures in the dismounted cohort (D1+D2) was significantly higher than in the mounted cohort (M1+M2) in both time periods (D1 vs. M1, 13.75 vs. 3.95/10,000 warrior-years [p{\textless}.001] and D2 vs. M2, 11.15 vs. 4.89/10,000 warrior-years [p{\textless}.0001]). In both the mounted and dismounted groups, the thoracolumbar (TL) junction was the most common site of injury (36.1{\%}). Fractures to the TL junction (T10-L3) increased significantly from Time Period 1 to 2 (34{\%} vs. 40{\%} of all fractures, respectively, p=.03). Thoracolumbar fractures were significantly more severe in that there were more Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Magerl Type A injuries versus all TL fractures, 1.75 versus 2.68/10,000 or 27{\%} of all spine fractures in Time Period 1 versus 40{\%} in Time Period 2 (p=.007). Furthermore, there were significantly fewer minor fractures (spinous process and transverse process fractures) (p{\textless}.0001). In Time Period 2, significantly more TL spine fractures were classified as major fractures, according to the Denis classification system, in both the mounted and dismounted groups; M1 group, 61 of 226 (27{\%}) versus the M2 group, 86 of 246 (34{\%}) (p{\textless}.0005) and 173 of 786 (22{\%}) in the D1 group versus 193 of 561 (34{\%}) in the D2 group. The spinal cord injury (SCI) incidence did not change in the mounted groups in Time Period 1 (7 of 71, 9.9{\%}) versus Time Period 2 (7 of 74, 9.5{\%}) (p=.935). In the dismounted groups, SCI actually decreased from D1 (55 of 228, 24{\%}) to D2 (28 of 176, 16{\%}) (p=.0428). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of spine fractures and SCI is significantly higher in dismounted operations. The data suggest that current uparmored vehicles convey greater protection against spinal fracture compared with dismounted operations in which servicemembers are engaged on foot, outside their vehicles. The TL junction is at greatest risk for spine fractures sustained in mounted and dismounted combat operations. Recently, the incidence of TL fractures, especially severe fractures, has significantly increased in mounted operations. Although there has been an increased incidence of TL spine fractures, in context of the number of servicemembers deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom, these severe fractures still represent a relatively rare event.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Internal fixation of unstable thoracolumbar spine fractures requires  correction of the lacking anterior column support. This usually entails insertion of a vertebral body replacement strut through an anterior approach, or a long posterior construct spanning at least two vertebrae above and two vertebrae below the fracture. Posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI)--one vertebra above and below--is suitable for approximately 40{\%} of fractures, but not for all. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures meeting our inclusion criteria were instrumented using a novel approach, combining percutaneous SSPI, pedicle screw augmentation with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fractured vertebra kyphoplasty. We retrospectively reviewed patient and fracture data, operative results and 1 year radiographic follow-up postoperatively in 40 of the patients. We reviewed operative complications of all 52 patients. RESULTS: Most fractures were AO/Magerl type A3.1, A3.2 and A3.3. They were instrumented within 72 h and ambulated without additional external bracing. Operative time averaged 2 h and blood loss was less than 50 cc in most cases. Complications were mostly related to PMMA leakage. On average, 3.3 degrees (0-13) of correction was lost after 3 months, but remained constant afterward. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous augmented short-segment pedicle instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar fractures can be done with short operative times, minimal blood loss and a low complication rate. The radiographical results at 1 year are equal to anterior stabilization and are better than other posterior-only techniques.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To study whether there is a sequential pattern in the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) rupture caused by deforming traumatic forces by analyzing magnetic resonance (MR) images in a consecutive prospective cohort of patients with traumatic vertebral fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PLC plays an important role in vertebral stability. However, the sequence in which the different components of the PLC tear, in the face of traumatic forces, has not been yet described. METHODS: Prospective study of 74 consecutive vertebral acute traumatic fractures analyzed using radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (FS-T2-w/short-tau inversion-recovery [STIR] sequences). Fracture morphology was classified according to the AO classification. Integrity of each PLC component-facet capsules, interspinous ligament (ISL), supraspinous ligament (SSL), and ligamentum flavum (LF)-was assessed and classified as intact, edema, or disruption. ISL edema was further subdivided depending on the extension ({\textgreater}50{\%}/{\textless}50{\%}). We analyzed the association between MRI signal and the AO progressive scale of morphological damage. RESULTS: AO type A1/A2 fractures associated with only facet distraction. A3 fractures showed additional ISL edema, usually less than 50{\%}, with neither SSL nor LF disruption. Type B1 fractures associated with facet distraction, ISL edema or disruption, and low rate of SSL/LF disruptions; B2 fractures increased SS/LF disruption rates. Type C fractures associated with facet fracture or dislocation and ISL, SSL, or LF complete rupture. We found high association (P {\textless} 0.001) between AO progressive scale and MRI signal. MRI analysis showed that posterior distraction forces begin in the facets and extend throughout the ISL, starting at its posterosuperior margin (finally disinserting the SSL superiorly) and traveling diagonally toward anteroinferior border, finally tearing the LF. CONCLUSION: MR images correlated with AO progressive scale of morphological damage, which showed a progressive orderly rupture sequence among the different PLC components as traumatic forces increased.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if thoracolumbar vertebral body collapse, translation, or canal compromise (CC) is associated with injury to the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) or neurological elements. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Radiographical parameters, including loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), vertebral body translation, local kyphosis (LK), and CC, are often used as indicators of spinal instability. The hypothesis of this study was that LOVBH greater than 50{\%}, LK greater than 20 degrees , translation greater than 3.5 mm, or CC greater than 50{\%} is associated with ligamentous and neurological injury. METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected spinal cord injury database was performed. Inclusion criteria include consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. Exclusion criteria include flexion-distraction injuries and pathological fractures. Computed tomographic scan measurements of the spine were performed by 2 experienced spine surgeons blinded to magnetic resonance imaging results. On magnetic resonance imaging, the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, facet joints, and disc were graded as intact, indeterminate, or disrupted. American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score and Frankel Scale score were recorded. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate relationships between vertebral body measurements, ligamentous injury, and neurological injury. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included in the study. Ten patients had kyphosis greater than 20 degrees , 1 patient had kyphosis greater than 30 degrees , and 9 patients had LOVBH greater than 50{\%}. There were 34 patients with vertebral body translation greater than 3.5 mm and 15 patients with CC greater than 50{\%}. Sixteen patients had ligamentous injury. There was a significant correlation between subjacent segment translation greater than 3.5 mm and ligamentous injury (R = 0.323, P = 0.029) and ASIA motor score (R = -0.379, P = 0.009). There was no significant correlation between ligamentous injury or neurological injury and the following threshold parameters: LOVBH greater than 50{\%}, vertebral body kyphosis greater than 20 degrees , caudal or cephalad interspinous widening greater than 7 mm, CC greater than 50{\%}, and sagittal transverse ratio less than 0.48. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that LOVBH greater than 50{\%} and LK greater than 20 degrees are not predictive of PLC injury in thoracolumbar burst fractures. Translation greater than 3.5 mm was associated with PLC injury. The PLC and neural elements should be directly assessed with magnetic resonance imaging if there is clinical concern.},

We retrospectively reviewed the patient's first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found that some unusual findings, indicative of psoas abscess had been overlooked. As a result, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous psoas abscess and spondylitis were considerably delayed. Despite the critical condition of patients in a similar emergency, surgeons should always pay close attention to the radiological findings and clinical symptoms of the patient before considering a surgical intervention or biopsy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show the possibility of neural canal enlargement and restoration of bony fragments through laminectomy and minimal facetectomy without pediculectomy or an anterior approach, and also to prove the adequacy of posterior stabilization of vertebral deformities after thoracolumbar bursting fracture. METHODS: From January 2003 to June 2009, we experienced 45 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. All patients enrolled were presented with either a neural canal compromise of more than 40{\%} with a Benzel-Larson Grade of VI, or more than 30{\%} compromise with less than a Benzel-Larson Grade of V. Most important characteristic of our surgical procedure was repositioning retropulsed bone fragments using custom-designed instruments via laminectomy and minimal facetectomy without removing the fractured bone fragments. Beneath the dural sac, these custom-designed instruments could push the retropulsed bone fragments within the neural canal after the decompression and bone fragment repositioning. RESULTS: The mean kyphotic deformities measured preoperatively and at follow-up within 12 months were 17.7 degrees (+/-6.4 degrees) and 9.6 degrees (+/-5.2 degrees), respectively. The mean midsagittal diameter improved from 8.8 mm (+/-2.8 mm) before surgery to 14.2 mm (+/-1.6 mm) at follow-up. The mean traumatic vertebral body height before surgery was 41.3{\%} (+/-12.6{\%}). At follow-up assessment within 12 months, this score showed a statistically significant increase to 68.3{\%} (+/-12.8{\%}). Neurological improvement occurred in all patients. CONCLUSION: Though controversy exists in the treatment of severe thoracolumbar burst fracture, we achieved effective radiological and clinical results in the cases of burst fractures causing severe canal compromise and spinal deformity by using this novel custom-designed instruments, via posterior approach alone.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and effect of percutanuous cannulated pedicle screw AF system fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fracture without neurologic impairment. METHODS: From June 2008 to June 2010,21 patients with thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fracture were treated with percutanuous cannulated pedicle screw fixation. There were 16 males and 5 females with the mean age of 32.7 years ranging from 23 to 55 years. Injured levels 5 cases was in T12, 13 was in L1, 3 was in L2. According to classification of AO, B1 was in 13 cases, B2 was in 8 cases. ASIA grade of all the patients were grade E. The mean operative time, bleeding volume, lengths of stay were evaluated. All the patients took the X-ray and three-dimensional CT reconstruction to observe the fracture healing and to measure the height of the anterior border of fracture vertebral body and the Cobb angle of kyphosis. The visual analogue scales (VAS) were compared preoperation and postoperation. The clinical effects were analyzed according to Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) from 10 aspects, including pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, traveling. RESULTS: All the operations were successful and the mean time was (109.0+/-16.0) min, blood loss was (90.0+/-15.0) ml, lengths of stay was (7.7+/-2.3) d. No postoperative neurological deficits or wound infection occured. One case occurred subcutaneous fluid of incision and 1 case occurred delayed healing of incision. Fifteen patients were followed up with an average of 16.7 months (12-33 months). The VAS score improved from preoperative 8.3+/-1.7 to 1.8+/-1.2 at final follow up (P{\textless}0.05). The ODI of last follow-up was (10.0+/-1.2){\%}. Three-dimensional CT reconstructions and X-rays showed the height of vertebral body increased from preoperative (54.0+/-17.1){\%} to (82.7 - 3.5){\%} at 12 months after operation (P{\textless}0.05). Cobb angle of kyphosis changed from preoperative (23.0+/-13.1) to (6.9+/-5.1) degrees at 12 months after operation (P{\textless}0.05). The healing time of fracture was (4.7+/-0.3) months. There were no significant loss of vertebral height or kyphosis correction between postoperative 1 months and last follow-up (P{\textgreater}0.05). There were satisfactory fracture reduction and good position of internal fixation,and no loss of reduction within 12 months and no fixation failure in follow-up. CONCLUSION: The minimally invasive percutaneous cannulated pedicle screw fixation technique is feasible in treatment of thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fracture without neurologic impairment. This technique can avoid re -injury of posterior ligaments and bone structure, and may rebuild posterior tension band structure with the advantages of less trauma, less bleeding,shorter operative time, rapid postoperative recovery and so on.},

METHODS: The CT (computed tomography) scan images of healthy adult T(11)-L(3) segments were imported into software Simpleware 2.0 to generate a triangular mesh model. Using software Geomagic 8 for model repair and optimization, a solid model was generated into the finite element software Abaqus 6.9. The reasonable element C3D8 was selected for bone structures. Created between bony endplates, the intervertebral disc was subdivided into nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus (44{\%} nucleus, 56{\%} annulus). The nucleus was filled with 5 layers of 8-node solid elements and annulus reinforced by 8 crisscross collagenous fiber layers. The nucleus and annulus were meshed by C3D8RH while the collagen fibers meshed by two node-truss elements. The anterior (ALL) and posterior (PLL) longitudinal ligaments, flavum (FL), supraspinous (SSL), interspinous (ISL) and intertransverse (ITL) ligaments were modeled with S4R shell elements while capsular ligament (CL) was modeled with 3-node shell element. All surrounding ligaments were represented by envelope of 1 mm uniform thickness. The discs and bone structures were modeled with hyper-elastic and elasto-plastic material laws respectively while the ligaments governed by visco-elastic material law. The nonlinear three-dimensional finite-element model of T(11)-L(3) segments was generated and its efficacy verified through validating the geometric similarity and disc load-displacement and stress distribution under the impact of violence. Using ABAQUS/ EXPLICIT 6.9 the explicit dynamic finite element solver, the impact test was simulated in vitro. RESULTS: In this study, a 3-dimensional, nonlinear FE model including 5 vertebrae, 4 intervertebral discs and 7 ligaments consisted of 78 887 elements and 71 939 nodes. The model had good geometric similarity under the same conditions. The results of FEM intervertebral disc load-displacement curve were similar to those of in vitro test. The stress distribution results of vertebral cortical bone, posterior complex and cancellous bone were similar to those of other static experiments in a dynamic impact test under the observation of stress cloud. CONCLUSION: With the advantages of high geometric and mechanical similarity and complete thoracolumbar, hexahedral meshes, nonlinear finite element model may facilitate the impact loading test for a further dynamic analysis of injury mechanism for thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome of posterior stabilization without decompression for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Thirty-one consecutive cases of thoracolumbar fractures involving T11-L2 stabilized by a pedicle screw system were reviewed. Neither reduction of the height of a fractured body nor any decompression procedure was added during surgery. Twenty-two patients had incomplete paraplegia; one patient had complete paraplegia. Neurological recovery and remodeling of the spinal canal were evaluated. Neurological status was evaluated at the time of injury, just before and after surgery, and at final follow-up. The degree of spinal canal compromise was assessed using axial CT scan images. The duration of follow-up averaged 39.6 months. The mean spinal canal compromise at the time of injury was 41.6{\%}, and no significant correlation was observed between the degree of canal compromise and the severity of the neurological deficit. Within 2-3 weeks, spinal canal remodeling had started in all patients whose spinal canal compromise was more than 30{\%}, and canal compromise had decreased significantly 3-4 weeks after injury. Seventeen of 22 patients with incomplete paraplegia had already shown partial neurological recovery even before surgery. At the final follow-up, all patients with incomplete paraplegia had improved by at least one modified Frankel grade. This study suggests that the effect of decompressing thoracolumbar fractures with neurological deficits remains unclear and questions the need to operate simply to remove retropulsed bone fragments. Posterior stabilization without decompression should constitute appropriate surgical treatment for these fractures.},

METHODS: Between July 2005 and January 2008, a total of 45 patients who had been diagnosed as having thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were treated with pedicle screw instrumentation plus vertebroplasty using calcium sulfate in our unit. The Cobb angles and loss rates of anterior-middle columns height at different time intervals were measured on lateral radiographs, and the preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). RESULTS: The Cobb angles and loss rates of anterior-middle columns height postoperatively period were restored significantly compared with those noted preoperatively. The angles and heights were well maintained for at least two years using this technique. The mean postoperative VAS (back pain) score was 2.1 +/- 0.8, which was significantly better (P {\textless} 0.001) than the mean preoperative VAS score 7.9 +/- 1.1. The average preoperative ODI was 66.6 +/- 8.1{\%} and this had improved significantly to 15.5 +/- 4.5{\%} by the latest follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001). No instrumentation failure was detected in this study. The calcium sulfate had been absorbed completely by 3-6 months postoperatively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The most common location for burst fractures occurs at the thoracolumbar junction, where the stiff thoracic spine meets the more flexible lumbar spine. With our current military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have seen a disproportionate number of low lumbar burst fractures. PURPOSE: To report our institutional experience in the management of low lumbar burst fractures. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical records and radiographs for all patients treated at our institution with combat-related injuries and thoracolumbar fractures. We included all patients who had sustained a burst fracture from T12 to L5 and had at least 1-year clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients sustained burst fractures. Nineteen patients (59.4{\%}) had low lumbar (L3-L5) burst fractures, and 12 patients (37.5{\%}) had thoracolumbar junction (T12-L2) burst fractures as their primary injury. Additionally, seven patients sustained less severe burst fractures at an additional level. One patient sustained burst fractures at both upper and lower lumbar levels. Of the low lumbar fractures, 52.6{\%} had evidence of neurologic injury, two of which were complete. Similarly, in the upper lumbar group, 58.2{\%} sustained a neurologic injury, two of which were complete. Twenty-two patients underwent surgical intervention, complicated by infection in 18{\%}. At most recent follow-up, all but one patient with presenting neurologic injury had persistent deficits. CONCLUSION: Low lumbar burst fractures are the predominant combat-related spine injury in our current military conflicts. The rigidity offered by current body armor may effectively lower the transition zone that normally occurs at the thoracolumbar junction, thereby, transferring forces into the lower lumbar spine. Increased awareness of this fracture pattern is warranted by all surgeons because of unique clinical challenges associated with its treatment. Although the incidence is increased in the military population, other surgeons may be involved with long-term care of these patients on completion of their military service.},

abstract = {Ejection from military aircraft exerts substantial loads on the lumbar spine. Fractures remain common, although the overall survivability of the event has considerably increased over recent decades. The present study was performed to develop and validate a biomechanically accurate experimental model for the high vertical acceleration loading to the lumbar spine that occurs during the catapult phase of aircraft ejection. The model consisted of a vertical drop tower with two horizontal platforms attached to a monorail using low friction linear bearings. A total of four human cadaveric spine specimens (T12-L5) were tested. Each lumbar column was attached to the lower platform through a load cell. Weights were added to the upper platform to match the thorax, head-neck, and upper extremity mass of a 50th percentile male. Both platforms were raised to the drop height and released in unison. Deceleration characteristics of the lower platform were modulated by foam at the bottom of the drop tower. The upper platform applied compressive inertial loads to the top of the specimen during deceleration. All specimens demonstrated complex bending during ejection simulations, with the pattern dependent upon the anterior-posterior location of load application. The model demonstrated adequate inter-specimen kinematic repeatability on a spinal level-by-level basis under different subfailure loading scenarios. One specimen was then exposed to additional tests of increasing acceleration to induce identifiable injury and validate the model as an injury-producing system. Multiple noncontiguous vertebral fractures were obtained at an acceleration of 21 g with 488 g/s rate of onset. This clinically relevant trauma consisted of burst fracture at L1 and wedge fracture at L4. Compression of the vertebral body approached 60{\%} during the failure test, with -6,106 N axial force and 168 Nm flexion moment. Future applications of this model include developing a better understanding of the vertebral injury mechanism during pilot ejection and developing tolerance limits for injuries sustained under a variety of different vertical acceleration scenarios.},

METHODS: Between February 2007 and January 2009, 25 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated by posterior short-segment fixation combined with transpedicular intervertebral bone graft and pedicle screw fixation in injured vertebrae. There were 18 males and 7 females with a mean age of 46 years (range, 28-63 years). The injured vertebrae were located at T10 in 1 case, T11 in 2 cases, T12 in 8 cases, L1 in 6 cases, L2 in 6 cases, L3 in 1 case, and L4 in 1 case. According to Denis classification, there were 14 cases of burst fractures and 11 cases of compression fractures. Based on Frankel classifications, 2 cases were rated as grade A, 4 cases as grade B, 8 cases as grade C, 7 cases as grade D, and 4 cases as grade E. The time between injury and operation was 6 hours to 7 days (mean, 4.6 days). The X-ray film was taken to measure the relative height of fractured vertebrae and Cobb angle, and Frankel classification was conducted to evaluate the function recovery of the spinal cord. RESULTS: The operations were performed successfully, and incisions healed primarily. All the patients were followed up 12-25 months (mean, 16 months). CT and X-ray films showed good bone graft healing and no loosening or breakage of screws and rods. The relative height of fractured vertebrae were 56.8{\%} +/- 15.6{\%} at preoperation, 91.2{\%} +/- 10.7{\%} immediately after operation, and 89.6{\%} +/- 10.3{\%} at 1 year after operation, showing significant differences between preoperation and postoperation (P {\textless} 0.01), while no significant difference between immediately after operation and 1 year after operation. The Cobb angles were (18.2 +/- 2.6), (7.5 +/- 1.4), and (8.7 +/- 1.1) degrees, respectively, showing significant differences between preoperation and postoperation (P {\textless} 0.01), while no significant difference between immediately and 1 year after operation. At 1 year after operation, the neural function in 16 cases was improved 1-3 grades. CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with transpedicular intervertebral bone graft and pedicle screw fixation in injured vertebrae has satisfactory effectiveness, which can reconstruct vertebral body height, increase the stability of anterior and middle column of the injured vertebrae, and prevent height loss of the injured vertebrae and loosening of instrumentation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Kyphotic deformity plays a key role in our evaluation of patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture, and there are several variables available for kyphotic deformity assessment, including Cobb angle, Gardner angle, and sagittal index. However, it remains unknown about intra- and inter-observer variability of sagittal index. AIM: The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability of the measurement for thoracolumbar burst fracture kyphosis using Cobb angle, Gardner angle, and sagittal index. Thirty-five patients with thorocolumbar burst fractures treated in our institute were identified. The lateral spine radiographs and midsagittal CT images of the 35 patients were measured on two separate occasions, in random order, by five attending spine surgeons using Cobb angle, Gardner angle, and sagittal index. METHOD: We statistically assessed the agreement, the intra-observer and the inter-observer reliability of the three methods. The intra-observer reliability is always better than the inter-observer reliability, regardless of the parameter being measured or the imaging modality. RESULTS: Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were the most consistent for Cobb angle, followed by Gardner angle and sagittal index. Midsagittal CT images had better intra- and inter-observer reliabilities than lateral plain radiography. Also, agreement was better using midsagittal CT images as compared with lateral plain radiography. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that Cobb angle is the most consistent in terms of intra- and inter-observer reliabilities in the assessment of thoracolumbar burst fracture kyphosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of dural tears and predictable factors suggesting dural tears in patients who had lumbar burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures. METHODS: A retrospective review was done on thirty-one patients who underwent operative treatment for lumbar burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures between January 2003 and December 2008. All patients were divided into two groups according to existence of dural tears, which were surgically confirmed; 21 patients with dural tears and 10 patients without dural tears. Clinical and radiographic findings were analyzed for their association with dural tears. RESULTS: Among a total of 31 patients, dural tears were detected in 21 (67{\%}) patients. A preoperative neurological deficits and mean separation distances of the edges in laminar fractures were found to be the reliable factors of dural tears (p=0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Decreased ratio of the central canal diameter and interpedicular distance were also the reliable factors suggesting dural tears (p=0.006 and 0.015, respectively). However, dural tears showed no significant association with age, sex, level of injury, absence of a posterior fat pad signal, the angle of retropulsed segment, or site of laminar fracture. CONCLUSION: Our study of lumbar burst fracture combined laminar fracture revealed that dural tears should be ruled out in cases of a preoperative neurological deficits, wide separation of the laminar fracture, severe canal encroachment, and wider interpedicular distance.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. PURPOSE: To analyze the treatment outcome of patients with lower thoracic and lumbar fractures combined with neurological deficits. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Although various methods of the surgical treatment for lower thoracic and lumbar fractures are used, there has been no surgical treatment established as a superior option than others. METHODS: Between March 2001 and August 2009, this study enrolled 13 patients with lower thoracic and lumbar fractures who underwent spinal canal decompression by removing posteriorly displaced bony fragments via the posterior approach and who followed up for more than a year. We analyzed the difference between the preoperative and postoperative extents of canal encroachment, degrees of neurologic deficits and changes in the local kyphotic angle. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 37 years. There were 10 patients with unstable burst factures and 3 patients with translational injuries. Canal encroachment improved from preoperative average of 84{\%} to 9{\%} postoperatively. Local kyphosis also improved from 20.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees . In 92{\%} (12/13) of the patients, neurologic deficit improved more than Frankel grade 1 and an average improvement of 1.7 grade was observed. Deterioration of neurologic symptoms was not observed. Although some loss of reduction of kyphotic deformity was observed at the final follow-up, serious complications were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: When posteriorly displaced bony fragments were removed by the posterior approach, neurological recovery could be facilitated by adequate decompression without serious complications. The posterior direct decompression could be used as one of treatments for lower thoracic and lumbar fractures combined with neurologic injuries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of TLICS classification to surgical options of thoracolumbar fractures by analyzing the cause of intravertebral vacuum sign, vertebral collapse and vertebral pseudarthrosis. METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2010, the clinical data about 15 patients with postoperative complications by thoracolumbar fracture after posterior internal fixation were retrospectively analyzed. There were 9 males and 6 females, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years, with an average of 54.6 years. Of them, fracture site in T12 was 7 cases, L1 was 5 cases, L2 was 3 cases; compression fractures was in 12 cases and burst fracture was in 3 cases; according to classification of TLICS, 12 cases were of type I ,3 cases of type III. And the causes of complications after posterior fixation were analyzed according clinical manifestation and imaging finding combined with review literatures. RESULTS: After 10 to 20 months following-up (with average of 15 months), loss of vertebral height found in 9 cases (4 cases existed vertebral collapse, as well as 3 cases occurred screw loosening) and Intravertebral Vacuum Sign appeared in 6 cases. CONCLUSION: In order to avoid the vertebral vacuum and fixation failure, the clinical data of patients should be roundly and carefully evaluated, surgical indications should be strictly controlled and the surgical approach should be selected according to correct classification. Particularly, the reconstruction of the stability of former spinal column shoud be paid more attention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effect of subtotal vertebrectomy, decompression and strut grafting in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures through posterolateral approach via posterior midline incision. METHODS: From May 2005 to July 2008, 14 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with subtotal vertebrectomy, decompression and strut grafting through posterolateral approach via posterior midline incision. There were 9 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 24 to 68 years, with an average of 42.3 years. All patients were single segment fractures, of them, T11 was in 1 case, T12 in 5, L1 in 5 and L2 in 3. According to AO classification in spinal fracture, type A3 was in 5 cases, B1 in 3, B2 in 3, C1 in 2, C2 in 1. According to the ASIA classification in neurological function, grade A was in 3 cases, B in 3, C in 5, D in 2, E in 1. The height of anterior border vertebral body, volume of spinal canal and neurological function were analyzed by X-ray films, CT scanning and ASIA classification preoperative, postoperative and at final follow-up. RESULTS: Operative time was from 3.5 to 5.5 hours with the mean of 4.0 hours; bleeding during operation was from 800 to 2 600 ml with the mean of 1 300 ml. Two cases with nerve root injury recovered without special handling after 3-6 months; 1 case with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid restored through lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage; 1 case with pleura tear healed through closed thoracic drainage. No iatrogenic vascular injury or infection was found. The follow-up time was from 8 to 36 months with the mean of 16.5 months. All patients had neurofunctional recovery at different degree, except that 3 patients in grade A. The height of anterior border vetebral body restored from (42.25 +/- 11.87){\%} preoperatively to (94.38 +/- 3.08){\%} postoperatively, and (92.87 +/- 3.32){\%} at final follow-up (P{\textless}0.05); volume of spinal canal (the actual volume of spinal canal/normal volume of spine canal) increased from (45.63 +/- 6.88){\%} preoperatively to (95.26 +/- 3.31){\%} postoperatively, and (96.13 +/- 2.56){\%} at final follow-up (P{\textless}0.05). Cobb angle were corrected from (25.64 +/- 4.40) degrees preoperatively to (5.80 +/- 1.14) degrees postoperatively; Cobb angle lost from 0 degrees to 6 degrees at final follow-up with (8.10 +/- 2.65) degrees. All patients obtained complete bony fusion without pseudarthrosis formation at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Subtotal vertebrectomy decompression and strut grafting through posterolateral approach via posterior midline incision is an effective and safe method in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture, which can restored height of intervertebral body, volume of spinal canal and physiological flexion of spinal column, and retain spinal permanent stability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the choice of operative approach for thoracolumbar burst fractures and evaluate its clinical effects. METHODS: From September 2005 to March 2009, the clinical data of 94 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were analyzed retrospectively. Including 59 males and 35 femals with an average age of 36.8 years (ranged from 20 to 63). The fractures were classified according to Denis classification: 17 cases of type A, 32 cases of type B, 6 cases of type C, 24 cases of type D, 15 cases of type E. Neurological injuries were classified according to ASIA classification: 3 cases of grade A, 4 cases of type B, 23 cases of grade C, 38 cases of grade D, 26 cases of grade E. Among the patients, 42 cases were treated with reduction, decompression, internal fixation with pedicle-screw through posterior approach, meanwhile, of them, 18 cases with posterior-lateral bone graft fusion; 36 cases were treated with decompression, bone graft, through anterior approach, of them, 16 cases with TSRH system fixation and 20 cases with Zeplate system fixation; 16 cases (because of bone block intruded into vertebral canal leading to spinal cord compression ) were treated with anterior and posterior approach, internal fixation with pedicle-screw through posterior approach and subtotal vertebrectomy, decompression, titanium mesh cages bone graft fusion through anterior approach, meanwhile, of them, 8 cases with screw-rod and titanium steel plate system fixation. RESULTS: All patients obtained good results and were followed up from 9 to 52 months with an average of 22.8 months. Cobb angle were corrected from preoperatively (25.00 +/- 5.50) degrees to postoperatively (4.20 +/- 1.80) degrees. Height of anterior and posterior border of vertebral body improved from preoperatively (50.80 +/- 2.82){\%}, (79.30 +/- 3.08){\%} to postoperatively (94.85 +/- 1.80){\%}, (98.20 +/- 1.40){\%}, respectively. The ratio of protruded bones to the spinal canal anteroposterior diameter decreased from preoperatively (33.10 +/- 1.40){\%} to postoperatively (6.70 +/- 1.50){\%}. Sagittal abnormity were corrected; posterior convex angle and height were no markedly lost during follow-up; no internal fixation loosening and titanium mesh displacement were found. In the aspect of never function, except for 1 case of grade A there is no recovered others obtained different improvement, among them, from grade A to B was in 2 cases; B to C, D was in 2,2, respectively; C to D, E was 16,7, respectively; D to E was in 38 cases. CONCLUSION: The two factors decide surgical methods:the integrity of posterior ligamentous complex and nervous system function. Anterior approach refers to patients with incomplete spinal cord injury and anterior vertebral canal compression; posterior approach refers to patients with injury of posterior ligamentous complex; combination with anterior and posterior approach refers to patients with two injury factors.},

METHODS: From March 2006 to May 2009, 27 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with short-segment fixation system and pedicle-screw placement on injured vertebrae through posterior approach. There were 19 males and 8 females with an average age of 36 years old ranging from 24 to 68 years. Eleven patients were injuried by traffic accident, 9 patients were injuried by falling from high, 5 patients were injuried by crush from weighty object, 2 patients were others injuries. Thoracolumbar fractures were classified according to Gertibein classification: 2 cases were of type A1, 3 cases A2, 12 cases A3, 5 cases B1, 5 cases B2. Among them, 14 cases were accompanied with spinal cord injuries,functional assessment of nerves was assessed according to Frankel criteria: 5 cases were of grade B, 3 cases C, 6 cases D. Lumbago according to Denis standard, grade P5 was in all cases. The injured level of 5 cases was in T11, 11 cases in T12, 8 cases in L1, 3 cases in L2. From injury to operation it was 2-15 days with an average of 4 days. The ratio of vertebral height between anterior and posterior border, anteroposterior Cobb angle were compared before and after operation. Function of nerves and index of lumbago were evaluated by Frankel and Denis classification. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 14 to 17 months with the mean of 15.5 months. At final follow-up,according to Frankel score system to evaluate function of nerve,2 cases were of grade B, 4 case grade C, 3 cases grade D, 5 cases grade E; according to Denis score system to evaluate index of lumbago, there was P1 (without pain) in 17 cases, P2 (between whiles minute pain, need not treatment) in 8 cases, P3 (moderate pain, between whiles need medication) in 2 cases. The ratio of vertebral height between anterior and posterior border from preoperatively 0.32 +/- 0.14 to postoperatively 0.85 +/- 0.03 (P{\textless}0.01); anteroposterior Cobb angle from preoperatively (25.3 +/- 7.8) degrees to postoperatively (11.1 +/- 1.5) degrees (P{\textless}0.01). At final follow-up, the ratio of vertebral height between anterior and posterior border, anteroposterior Cobb angle were respectively 0.81 +/- 0.06 and (11.8 +/- 1.9) degrees, there was no significant difference between postoperative and at final follow-up (P{\textgreater}0.05). No complications such as infection, internal fixation failure,nerve injuries were found during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Posterior short-segment fixation system and pedicle-screw placement on level of injured vertebrae is one kind of effective method in treating thoracolumbar fracture, which can maintain corrective effect and obtain better clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a menace to the elderly generation causing diminished quality of life due to pain and deformity. At first, conservative treatment still is the method of choice. In case of resulting deformity, sintering and persistent pain vertebral cement augmentation techniques today are widely used. Open correction of resulting deformity by different types of osteotomies addresses sagittal balance, but has comparably high morbidity. Besides conventional vertebral cement augmentation techniques balloon kyphoplasty has become a popular tool to address painful thoracic and lumbar compression fractures. It showed improved pain reduction and lower complication rates compared to standard vertebroplasty. Interestingly the results of two placebo-controlled vertebroplasty studies question the value of cement augmentation, if compared to a sham operation. Even though there exists now favourable data for kyphoplasty from one randomised controlled trial, the absence of a sham group leaves the placebo effect unaddressed. Technically kyphoplasty can be performed with a transpedicular or extrapedicular access. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-cement should be favoured, since calcium phosphate cement showed inferior biomechanical properties and less effect on pain reduction especially in less stable burst fractures. Common complications of kyphoplasty are cement leakage and adjacent segment fractures. Rare complications are toxic PMMA-monomer reactions, cement embolisation, and infection.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare clinical and radiological results of treatment thoraco-lumbar spine fractures by short segment transpedicular stabilization accompanied by three techniques of reconstruction: posterior lumbar interbody fusion, vertebral body Daniaux reconstruction and combination of both methods. AO system was used to classify the fractures. Frankel's grade system was used for assessment of neurological deficit on admission and subsequently in the postoperative and follow-up period. The height of the fractured vertebral body and angle of segmental kyphotic deformation was measured on lateral X-ray pre- and post-operatively and at last follow-up. To the retrospective analysis we included 167 patients operated in the Orthopaedic and Traumatology Department, Medical University of Lublin in years 1998-2007. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed in 69 patients (41{\%}), isolated vertebral body Daniaux reconstruction in 82 patients (49{\%}) and combination of both methods was performed in 16 patients (10{\%}). The follow-up period has ranged from 3 to 13 years (mean 6.9 years). The most common type of the fracture was a B type (104 patients -62{\%}), followed by type A (43 patients--26{\%}), and type C (20--patients 12{\%}). The neurological deficit was present in 80 patients. The postoperative neurological improvement was noticed in 37 patients (46{\%}), whereas in 46 patients (54{\%}) neurological status has not changed after the treatment. From 87 patients without neurological symptoms, we observed postoperatively contemporary neurological complications in 11 (12.6{\%}) cases. The biggest correction of fractured vertebral height (mean 0.15) and correction of segmental kyphotic deformity (mean 6.3 degrees) we have noticed in the group of isolated vertebralbody Daniaux reconstruction with use of bone grafts. However in every group of patients we observed significant loss of correction during follow-up period. At the latest follow-up assessment there were no differences in vertebral body height of segmental kyphotic deformation between the analyzed groups of patients. None of analyzed methods of treatment: posterior lumbar interbody fusion, vertebral body Daniaux reconstruction or combination of these methods did not protect from recurrence of kyphotic deformity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been enhanced in the diagnosis of thoracolumbar fractures due to its ability to examine soft tissue injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to analyze the usefulness of MRI in fracture diagnosis and its influence on treatment decision making. Thirty-three patients were enrolled after suffering an acute traumatic thoracolumbar fracture. Osteoporotic or pathologic fractures were excluded. Fractures were initially classified using X-ray and CT scan following the AO classification. Afterward, a selective MRI protocol was performed with T1 and T2-weighted FS/STIR sequences. Subsequently, fractures were classified according to the TLICS system and reclassified following the AO system. Analysis was performed before and after MRI, focusing on: diagnostic changes, occult fractures and differences in treatment decision making. RESULTS: Thirty patients (15 males, 15 females) with an average age of 39.9 years were studied. Forty-one fractures were initially diagnosed using plain X-rays and CT scans, while MRI diagnosed 50 fractures and 9 vertebral contusions. MRI modified our diagnosis in 40{\%} of our patients (discovering 18 occult injuries), the classification of fracture pattern in 24{\%} of the fractures (mostly upgrading type A to type B patterns) and the therapeutic management in 16{\%} of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRI seems to be a useful tool in the evaluation of thoracolumbar acute fractures, as it allows a better visualization of the posterior complex integrity and of the levels involved, offering additional information compared to traditional diagnostic tools.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A number of techniques have been described in the management of thoracolumbar spinal fractures, testimony to the absence of consensus on their treatment. For the past few years, minimally invasive techniques have been developed to limit surgery-related iatrogenic injury. The objective of this study was to report the results of percutaneous management of these lesions and the technical progress made based on our experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients presenting an A3 fracture, with a mean age of 51 years, were included in this study. All had a balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous osteosynthesis. Of the first 22 cases, kyphoplasty was the initial procedure performed associated with reduction maneuvers using distraction. Assessment was clinical (neurological status and pain intensity) and radiological (implant positioning, cement leakage, restoration of local kyphosis and any loss of correction). RESULTS: In the overall series, the mean local kyphosis correction was 11 degrees with a 2 degrees angle loss at the last follow-up. Pain assessment showed significant improvement, decreasing from 6/10 to 1/10 on discharge. The mean hospital stay lasted 4 days. On the follow-up radiological exams, no cases of extrapedicular screw migration were noted; in two cases, lateral cement leakage was found. The results were equivalent in terms of correction no matter which procedure was performed first, although for the second part of the series the technology was available to bend the spinal fixation rod to the desired curve. DISCUSSION: The results of this study support the growing interest in minimally invasive techniques in the management of spinal injuries with no neurological deficit. In addition, the evolving material makes it possible to come close to conventional techniques, including reduction maneuvers, while limiting muscle injury by using a purely percutaneous approach. Rigorous patient selection is necessary and the time to learn the procedure must be taken into account. Studies with a longer follow-up are required to confirm the stability of the correction over time. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV. Retrospective observational study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adrenalin-seeking airborne sports like BASE-jumping, paragliding, parachuting, delta-gliding, speedflying, and skysurfing are now firmly with us as outdoor lifestyle activities and are associated with a high frequency of severe injuries, especially to the spine. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all airborne sports-associated spinal and pelvic injuries admitted to a Level I trauma centre in the Swiss Alps between 1st March 2000 and 31st October 2009. Spinal injuries were classified by the Magerl system and pelvic injuries by the AO/OTA scheme modified by Isler and Ganz. Spino-pelvic dissociation fractures in airborne sports were compared to similar injuries in the general trauma population using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 181 patients (11 BASE-jumpers, 144 paragliders, 19 parachuters, 1 speedflyer, 4 deltagliders, 2 skysurfer) were included. 161 (89{\%}) were male. Median age was 37.0 years (IQR=29.0-47.0) and ISS 8 (IQR=4-13). 89 (49.2{\%}) patients sustained spinal fractures. Type A fractures were predominant (91.5{\%}), followed by Type C (5.3{\%}) and Type B (3.2{\%}). The level L1 was most often affected (35.1{\%}). 17 patients (9.4{\%}) had pelvic ring fractures. Most frequent were Type C fractures (41.2{\%}), followed by Types A and B (29.4{\%} each). 8 paragliders (4.4{\%}) suffered spino-pelvic dissociation injuries. The odds ratio for sustaining such fractures in paragliders was 21-fold higher (OR 21.04, 95{\%} CI 7.83-56.57, p{\textless}0.001) than in the general trauma population. CONCLUSIONS: Serious spinal and pelvic injuries account for most injuries sustained during airborne sporting activities. The thoracolumbar region was most often affected, but the lumbopelvic junction is also especially vulnerable as high impact forces from vertical and horizontal deceleration need to be absorbed. The frequency of spino-pelvic dissociation was very high in paragliding injuries, with a 21-fold higher odds ratio than in the general trauma population.},

abstract = {Subsets of cancer survivors who have been subjected to thoracic irradiation face  the prospect of developing pulmonary injury. Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is an insidious injury that presents 6 to 24 months after irradiation and continues to progress over a period of years. TGF-beta and reactive oxygen species contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of this injury. The transcription factor NRF2 controls antioxidant gene expression and therefore regulates the cellular oxidant burden. This work demonstrates an additional paradigm for NRF2: suppression of TGF-beta-mediated signaling, assessed by measuring expression of a surrogate TGF-beta1 target gene (PAI-1) in lung fibroblasts. Thoracic irradiation of Nfe2l2(-/-) mice resulted in rapid expression of PAI-1 and FSP-1 compared to irradiated wild-type mice. Examination of lung tissue 16 weeks after thoracic irradiation of Nfe2l2(-/-) mice revealed the presence of distended alveoli and decreased numbers of alveoli compared to wild-type mice. Suppression of NRF2 expression shortened life span in mice administered 16 Gy to the thorax. Nfe2l2(+/-) and Nfe2l2(-/-) mice exhibited a mean life span of 176 days compared to wild-type mice, which lived an average of 212 days. These novel results identify NRF2 as a susceptibility factor for the development of late tissue injury.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To our knowledge, thoracolumbar burst fractures with a neurological deficit treated with posterior decompression and interlaminar fusion have never been reported. Our study was to assess the outcome of posterior decompression and interlaminar fusion in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures with a neurological deficit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients suffering from thoracolumbar burst fractures with a neurological deficit were included this study. All patients were treated with posterior decompression, interlaminar fusion and short-segment fixation of the vertebrae above and below the fracture level and the fractured vertebrae. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for at least 24 months after surgery. Operative time and blood loss averaged 72 min and 325 ml, respectively. Thirty-eight patients with incomplete neurological lesions improved, by at least one American Spine Injury Association grade, whereas no neurological deterioration was observed in any case. Overall sagittal alignment improved from an average preoperative 22.4 degrees -4.6 degrees kyphosis at the final follow-up observation. The anterior vertebral body height ratio improved from 0.61 before surgery to 0.90 after surgery, whereas posterior vertebral body height ratio improved from 0.90 to 0.95. Spinal canal encroachment was reduced from an average 61.5{\%} before surgery to 8.7{\%} after surgery. Interlaminar radiological fusion was achieved within 6-8 months after surgery. No instrumentation failure was found in any patients. CONCLUSION: Posterior decompression, interlaminar fusion with posterior short-segment fixation provided excellent immediate reduction for traumatic segmental kyphosis and significant spinal canal clearance, and restored vertebral body height in the fracture level in patients with a thoracolumbar burst fracture and associated neurological deficit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The current approach to the evaluation and treatment of military casualties in the Global War on Terror is informed by medical experience from prior conflicts and combat encounters from the last 10 years. In an effort to standardize the care provided to military casualties in the ongoing conflicts, the Department of Defense (DoD) has published Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that deal specifically with the combat casualty sustaining a spinal injury. However, the combat experience with spine injuries in the present conflicts remains incompletely described. PURPOSE: To describe the CPGs for the care of the combat casualty with suspected spine injuries and discuss them in light of the published military experience with combat-related spinal trauma. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: A literature review was conducted regarding published works that discussed the incidence, epidemiology, and management of combat-related spinal trauma. The CPGs, established by the DoD, are discussed in light of actual military experiences with spine trauma, the present situation in the forward surgical teams and combat support hospitals treating casualties in theater, and recent publications in the field of spine surgery. RESULTS: In the conventional wars fought by the United States between 1950 and 1991 (Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I), the incidence of spine injuries remained close to 1{\%} of all combat casualties. However, in the Global War on Terror, the enemy has relied on implements of asymmetric warfare, including sniper attacks, ambush, roadside bombs, and improvised explosive devices. The increase in explosive mechanisms of injury has elevated the number of soldiers exposed to blunt force trauma and, consequently, recent publications reported the highest incidence of combat-related spinal injuries in American military history. Wounded soldiers are expeditiously evacuated through the echelons of care but typically do not receive surgical management in theater. The current CPGs for the care of soldiers with combat-related spinal injuries should be re-examined in light of data regarding the increasing number of spine injuries, new injury patterns, such as lumbosacral dissociation and low lumbar burst fractures, and recent reports within the field of spine surgery as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: American and coalition forces are sustaining the highest spine combat casualty rates in recorded history and previously unseen injuries are being encountered with increased frequency. While the CPGs provide useful direction in terms of the evaluation and management of combat casualties with spine injuries, such recommendations may warrant periodic re-evaluation in light of recent combat experiences and evolving scientific evidence within the spine literature.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled follow-up study. OBJECTIVE: The objective  of this study was to compare the results of anterior approach versus posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Burst fractures are frequently associated with instability or neurological deficit. Anterior subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction with instrumentation are an established method for a highly unstable burst fracture. In the past few years, subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine could be completed by posterior approach. Posterior segmental pedicle screw instrumentation, with its more rigid fixation and less technically demanding, could offer potential advantages. METHODS: A total of 64 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were divided into 2 groups randomly. Group A was treated by anterior approach and group B was treated by posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine. During the minimum 24 months (range, 24 to 72 mo) follow-up period, all patients were prospectively evaluated for clinical and radiologic outcomes. The intraoperative blood loss, operative time, complications of operation, pulmonary function, Frankel scale, and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score were used for clinical evaluation, whereas the heights of anterior edge of vertebral body and the Cobb angle were examined for radiologic outcome. RESULTS: All patients in this study achieved solid fusion, with significant neurological improvement. The intraoperative blood loss (P{\textless}0.05) and complications of operation were less, the operative time was shorter (P{\textless}0.05), and the pulmonary function after operation was better in the group B (P{\textless}0.05). The Frankel scale, the ASIA motor score, and the radiologic results were not significantly different (P{\textless}0.05) at all time points between the 2 groups A and B. But the 2 groups improved in their neurological function by approximately 1.3 Frankel grade and 15.6 ASIA motor scores at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Anterior approach and posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine are sufficient for surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Less intraoperative blood loss and complications, shorter operative time, and better pulmonary function after operation are the significant advantages of posterior surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study therapeutic effects of self-designed canal decompressor in the posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, and provide evidence for widespread application. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2008, the self-designed canal decompressor was used in 43 patients (30 males and 13 females, ranging in age from 22 to 49 years) with thoracolumbar burst fractures. According to Denis classification, there were 12 cases of type A, 24 cases of type B, 6 cases of type D and 1 case of type E. Affected segment: 16 patients in T12,19 patients in L1 and 8 patients in L2. The index of intra-operative blood loss, postoperative 24 h wound drainage volume, and operative time were compared with those of 16 patients who undergone traditional operation. The preoperative and postoperative vertebral canal volume, Cobb angles, residual vertebral body height, neurological outcome, and back pain were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: All the patients healed without wound infection, neurological symptoms and other complications. Forty-three patients were followed up ranging from 12 to 24 months, with a mean of (16.5 +/- 2.5) months. Compared with traditional posterior operation, the blood loss and operative time in modified posterior approach group had statistically significant difference, but the postoperative 24 h wound drainage had no significant difference between the two groups. CT scan indicated that applying the canal decompressor allowed efficient restore of canal volume from preoperative (49.4 +/- 16.7){\%} to postoperative (12.8 +/- 4.2){\%}. The X-ray showed Cobb angles reduced from preoperative (30.1 +/- 2.4)degrees to postoperative (5.1 +/- 0.6) degrees. Mean vertebral height was restored to (81.5 +/- 5.5){\%} after operation. Follow-up evaluation indicated that neurological recovery presented in 33 patients,with an average improvement of 0.87 Frankel grades. Neurological deterioration was not observed. CONCLUSION: Applying the canal decompressor enables efficient and safe spinal decompression, restore the height of the injured vertebrae, reconstruction of the anterior-middle column stability,and prevention of postoperative vertebral height and Cobb angle lost.},

METHODS: From March 2007 to June 2009, 21 patients with low lumbar burst fracture were retrospectively analyzed, 11 cases were in L3,6 in L4 and 4 in L5. There were 16 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 25 to 59 year with an average of 37.9 years. According to ASIA classification, nerve function was level A in 2 cases, level B in 2, level C in 10, level D in 4 and level E in 3. Pedicle screws were implanted and bending rod reduction in situ technique was applied through posterior approach. Radiographic and neurological scores were compared before and after operation. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 12 to 39 months with an average of 16.5 months. Radiographic examinations demonstrated that anterior height of fractured vertebral body was from 57.9{\%} preoperatively to 94.1{\%} postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.01 ); sagittal index was from 29.1 preoperatively to 0.240 postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.01). Spinal canal occupation ratio was from 49.6{\%} preoperatively to 13.4{\%} postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.01). Nerve function was level A in 2 cases,level B in 0, level C in 0, level D in 4 and level E in 15.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The optimal management of thoracolumbar spine fractures remains a matter of controversy. The current literature implies that the use of short-segment pedicle screw fixation may be inappropriate because of its high reported failure rate. The purpose of this study is to report the short-term results of thoracolumbar burst and compression fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2007, 19 patients with thoracolumbar acute traumatic fractures were instrumented with posterior short-segment pedicle screws. The patients' case notes, operation records, preoperative and postoperative radiographs (sagittal index, anterior body compression and regional kyphosis), computed tomography scans, neurological findings (Frankel functional classification), and follow-up records up to 18 months were reviewed. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found between the patients' preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, anterior body compression and regional kyphosis measurement. One case resulted in screw pedicle screw pullout and subsequently, kyphotic deformity. The patient underwent revision surgery to long-segment posterior instrumentation and fusion. None of the patients showed an increase in neurological deficit. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the short-term follow-up results suggest a favourable outcome for short-segment instrumentation. Load shearing classification is essential for the selection of patient for short-segment instrumentation. However, the long-term follow-up evaluation will be needed to verify our findings.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of treating acute thoracolumbar burst fractures using anterior corpectomy and reconstruction with a mesh cage and instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is increasing interest in using an anterior mesh cage with instrumentation after corpectomy for burst fractures. However, there is only limited information on this technique in the literature. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (mean age 37.6 y old) that had sustained a thoracolumbar burst fracture were included in this study. On admission, 20 patients (90.9{\%}) had an incomplete neurological deficit. An anterior thoracolumbar approach was used to perform anterior corpectomy and reconstruction with a mesh cage and lateral fixation with screws and dual rods. We studied the operation date and delayed the blood loss, and we used the American Spinal Injury Association grade to evaluate the neurological status before surgery and in the follow-up period. Local kyphosis measured by the Cobb method was compared before and after the surgery using Wilcoxon signed-rank test/2-tailed test for analysis. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients were operated within 2 days after admission and all were followed for a minimum of 25 months. The mean follow-up period was 47.4 months (range, 25 to 71 mo). Blood loss averaged 1445 mL. Of the 20 patients with incomplete neurological lesions, there were 6 (30{\%}) patients with an improvement of at least 1 American Spinal Injury Association grade. No neurological deterioration was observed in any case. The local kyphosis measured by the Cobb method was improved from a mean of 15 degrees preoperative to a mean of 9.6 degrees in early postoperative period (P=0.002). The mean after 2 years was 11.5 degrees (P=0.011). There was no instrumentation failure. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior thoracolumbar decompression and fusion secured with an anterior mesh cage and instrumentation in thoracolumbar burst fractures provided excellent immediate reduction of post-traumatic local kyphosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have shown to improve pain and functional outcome in cases with symptomatic vertebral fractures. Although restoration of the vertebral body height and kyphosis seemed to be easier with balloon kyphoplasty, it became clear that some of the correction achieved by the balloon is lost once it was deflated. Vertebral body stent was developed to eliminate this phenomenon. To our knowledge this is the first study in describing this technique in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with 20 fractured vertebral bodies were included. All fractures were Type A1.3 or A3.1 (incomplete burst). Information about pain (visual analogue scale-VAS) and function (Oswestry disability index-ODI) and vertebral body deformity (vertebral angle-VA) was recorded in a prospective way at regular intervals. Patients were classified into osteoporotic group (7 patients) and traumatic groups (10 patients, younger than 60 years). RESULTS: There were 6 male and 11 female patients with mean age of 58.1 years (31-88 years). Mean follow up was 12 months. The preoperative pain level showed a mean VAS score of 8.9 in osteoporotic group and 9.7 in traumatic group. Postoperatively, in osteoporotic group, mean VAS was 4.8 at 6 weeks, 4.0 at 6 months and 2.5 at 12 months compared with traumatic fracture group where it was 2.7 at 6 weeks, 2.2 at 6 months and 1.6 at 12 months. Mean ODI in osteoporotic group was 41.7{\%} (14-58{\%}) and in traumatic group it was 20.4{\%} (6-33{\%}). Mean vertebral body angle prior to surgery in osteoporotic group was 9.7 whilst postoperatively it was 5.2 degrees ; so the mean correction achieved was 4.5 degrees . In traumatic group preoperative VA was 13 degrees whilst postoperatively it was 5.7 degrees ; therefore the mean correction achieved was 7.3 degrees . None of the patients lost reduction at their last follow up. CONCLUSION: Vertebral body stenting leads to satisfactory improvement in pain, function and kyphosis correction in the treatment of osteoporotic and traumatic fractures. Anterior spinal column, especially the fragmented superior endplate is nicely reconstructed by the stent provided it is inserted accurately. With addition of posterior transpedicular instrumentation, indications for this technique may be wider covering some Type B and C fractures with similar vertebral body damage.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Neurologically intact lumbar and thoracolumbar fractures are frequent but their treatment is not codified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of minimally invasive treatment of such fractures by percutaneous fixation associated with balloon kyphoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 2008 and July 2010, 24 patients were treated. There were 12 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 53 years (range 20-88 years). Fractures were classified as one Magerl lesion type A1, one type A2, 19 A3 (five A31, 10 A32, four A33), and three type B2. The treatment was kyphoplasty of the fractured vertebra followed by percutaneous fixation of the vertebra above and below the fracture. Patient follow-up included an analysis of pain using the visual analogic score, the Oswestry score, and functional X-ray and CT analysis. RESULTS: Surgery lasted a mean 99 minutes. At the last follow-up, the mean pain was scored at 0.9 and the Oswestry score was 13.2. Reduction of vertebral kyphosis was 8.6 degrees and reduction of the corrected regional angle was 7.1 degrees . The gain in vertebral height was 17{\%}. All pedicle screws were positioned correctly and no neurological, septic, or thromboembolic complications were observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Percutaneous osteosynthesis combined with balloon kyphoplasty is a valuable surgical technique in the treatment of thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures with no neurologic deficit. The clinical results are good and the technique allows the patient to return home earlier without having to wear a corset. The X-ray result scores are very encouraging, with corrections similar to conventional surgery in terms of vertebral height and kyphosis. This technique can be an alternative to conventional open surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV: Prospective observational study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional results from patients with surgical fractures in the thoracolumbar spine. METHOD: A prospective study including 100 patients with spinal fractures in the thoracic and lumbar segments was conducted. The lesions were classified in accordance with the AO system, and the patients were treated surgically. The presence of early kyphosis and its evolution after the surgical intervention, and the presence of postoperative pain and its evolution up to the 24(th) week after the surgery, were evaluated. We compared our data with the literature. RESULTS: One hundred surgical patients were analyzed, of which 37 were type A, 46 were type B and 17 were Type C. Patients who presented Frankel A kept their clinical status, but patients with Frankel B or higher evolved with some improvement. The average improvement in pain based on a visual analog scale was more than four points. All the patients were able to return to their daily routine activities, although we did not take the return to work to be an assessment criterion. CONCLUSION: Despite controversy regarding the indications for surgery in cases of fractured spine, we believe that the method that we used was satisfactory because of the good results and low complication rate. However, more randomized prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed in order to evaluate this type of fixation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Currently, there is no reproducible method that produces thoracolumbar burst fractures in human cadavers wherein the fracture configuration mirrors that seen naturally, and soft tissues are maintained. PURPOSE: To describe a novel method of burst fracture production. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical. METHODS: Five cadaveric specimens were potted in polymethymethacrylate at T10 and L4; T10 to T12 and L2 to L4 were encased in a pourable rigid foam; flexion of 15 degrees was created focused at L1; and a drop tower weight of 25 kg via "free fall" was used. On load delivery, the spine was allowed to flex without restriction (native bony and soft-tissue constraints). X-ray, computed tomography scan, and open dissection were used to confirm burst configuration. RESULTS: All five specimens were found to have the "classic" burst configuration characterized by superior end plate comminution, depression of the anterior column, middle column burst with three to five fragments; the classic central fragment retropulsed into the canal, and the pedicular spread via basilar fracture. CONCLUSION: This novel method affords true burst fracture reproduction without "prestressing" (notching, osteotomies, laminectomy, stripping) used in previous methods. This should allow greater accuracy for the translation of biomechanical testing to clinical applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fractures account for more than half of all thoracolumbar fractures and are frequently associated with spine instability and neurological deficit. The anterior approach is favored when decompression of the spinal canal is necessary. We compare two commonly available struts used for anterior approach after corpectomy: expandable versus nonexpandable titanium cages. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 32 patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by a single surgeon with a mean follow-up of 13 months. Half of the patients had nonexpandable cages placed (group 1) and the other half had expandable cages placed (group 2). Anterolateral plate/screw supplementation was used in all patients. Radiographs were reviewed to assess kyphosis correction and bony fusion. RESULTS: In group 1, the mean kyphotic angle before surgery was 20.5 degrees. Immediately after surgery, this angle improved to 6 degrees and was 8.5 degrees at final follow-up. In group 2, the mean kyphotic angle before surgery was 21.5 degrees. This angle improved to 4 degrees immediately after surgery and was 6.5 degrees at final follow-up. At the end of follow-up, 2 of 16 patients in group 1 demonstrated pseudoarthrosis, whereas no patients in group 2 showed any evidence of nonunion. No patient in either group experienced hardware failure or new neurological deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior decompression and instrumented stabilization with either an expandable or nonexpandable cage is a safe and reliable surgical treatment option for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Expandable cage enables greater immediate correction of kyphosis with good fusion rate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty with Genex combined with pedical screw fixation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From February 2007 to October 2009, 38 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty with Genex and pedical screw fixation. There were 25 males and 13 females, with a mean age of 42 years old (ranged, 30 to 68 years). The cause of injuries included road accident of 9 cases,crush injury of 7 cases,crash of 21 cases and others of 1 case. The fractures were classified according to Denis classification: 6 cases of type A, 22 cases of type B, 7 cases of type C and 3 cases of type D. Functional assessment of nerves was assessed according to ASIA criteria: 4 cases of type A,7 cases of type B, 10 cases of type C, 6 cases of type D and 11 cases of type E. Therapeutic effects were assessed by imaging and ASIA standard. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 6 months to 34 months,with a mean period of 16.5 months. The results were observed after 1 week by X-ray inspection that vertebrate column array of all patients were restored to normal, anterior height of centrum restored to (98.50 +/- 2.17){\%}, posterior height of centrum for (98.87 +/- 1.82){\%}; and Cobb angle of injured vertebra decreased to average of (1.63 +/- 2.15) degree; the stenosis rate restored to (1.45 +/- 3.47){\%}. By X-ray inspection, it was observed that the vertebral height kept good at 6 months after operation, and the bone density almostly normal. By CT scanning, it was observed that bone defects of vertebrae disappeared, and restored to normal bony tissue. The nerve function restored 1 to 2 grades 6 months after operation. CONCLUSION: Artificial bone of Genex applied in vertebral body-plasty has good biocompatibility, strong bone inducibility, no complications, little loss of vertebrae height and Cobb angle, and satisfactory results in the near future.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of spinal canal decompression through  the posterior transpedicular approach in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: We present 25 consecutive patients (19 men and 6 women; mean age 36 years; age range, 24-48 years) with incomplete neurological deficits (ASIA B and C) resulting from thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by posterior transpedicular spinal canal decompression and posterior segmental instrumented fusion. Canal compromise at presentation was 51.7 +/- 11.2{\%}. RESULTS: The mean surgical time was 122 minutes (range, 108-122 minutes), and the mean blood loss was 528 +/- 123 ml. Canal compromise improved to 15.3 +/- 7.8{\%}. At a mean followup of 14 months (range, 6-18 months), fourteen patients improved to ASIA D and were able to walk with an orthosis; seven improved to ASIA C, and four had no improvement (ASIA B). Seven ASIA B and all ASIA C patients had immediate postoperative neurological improvement to ASIA C and ASIA D; two ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C within six weeks after the operation. Anterior decompression was necessary in two (8{\%}) ASIA B patients who did not improve after the initial operation; these patients, subsequently improved to ASIA C. There were no intraoperative complications. Superficial wound infections occurred in two patients and were treated with wound care and antibiotics; deep infection occurred in one patient and was treated with debridement and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Posterior transpedicular spinal canal decompression and instrumentation is a reasonable alternative technique to anterior decompression procedures and circumferential fusion, providing for satisfactory canal decompression and neurological improvement.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcome of patients  with a single thoracolumbar burst fracture treated with circumferential short-segment fusion consisting of posterior reduction, short-segment fusion, and delayed staged mini-open anterior short-segment fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In attempting to combine the advantages of posterior procedures, including initial correction of kyphosis and early decompression, and those of anterior procedures, including direct decompression and restoration of anterior column support, a combined posterior and delayed staged anterior procedure seems to be a reasonable choice. However, conventional combined procedures are invasive. METHODS: We prospectively selected 28 consecutive patients with single thoracolumbar burst fracture for circumferential short-segment fusion consisting of posterior reduction, short-segment fusion, and delayed staged mini-open anterior short-segment fusion. The pedicle screw systems were removed after confirmation of posterior bony fusion to preserve as many motion segments as possible in those patients who could be treated with circumferential monosegmental fusion. Radiographic and clinical assessment of 28 patients who received this treatment was carried out. RESULTS: The mean loss of correction of kyphosis between the time of the combined procedure and final follow-up was 3.7 degrees (range, 0 to 10.2 degrees). Bony fusion was eventually achieved in all patients. There were 15 cases with monosegmental and 13 cases with bisegmental circumferential fusion. All 10 patients with initial neurological deficit improved by at least 1 Frankel grade: 3 improved by 1 grade, 5 improved by 2 grades, and 2 improved by 3 grades. In total, 27 patients, who were P1 or P2 on the Denis pain scale, were considered to have obtained clinically satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS: This combined procedure is less invasive than the conventional combined one, and finally achieves shorter stabilization, resulting in preservation of motion segments. It thus seems to be a reasonable treatment option for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

METHODS: Forty-six patients treated with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting from January 1999 to December 2009 and followed up for 19-119 months (average 67 +/- 13 months) were reviewed retrospectively, and were compared with 18 patients who had underwent posterolateral fusion during the same period through radiographic analysis. Radiographic measurements included Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle (VWA), ratio between anterior and posterior vertebral height (APHR), upper inter-vertebral angle, lower inter-vertebral angle on X-ray, CT and MRI. RESULTS: In transpedicular intracorporeal grafting group, the VWA was corrected from 27.2 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees to 7.0 degrees +/- 3.0 degrees and the APHR from (53.3 +/- 11.8){\%} to (92.3 +/- 2.4){\%}. In posterolateral fusion group, the VWA was corrected from 23.9 degrees +/- 4.4 degrees to 8.8 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees and the APHR from (60.7 +/- 10.0){\%} to (88.5 +/- 3.3){\%}.

METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2008, 103 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, including 75 males and 28 females, the average age was 45.6 years (range, 18 - 72 years). All of them were of no neurological deficits. There were 65 cases of traffic injury, 23 cases of fall injury and 15 cases of smashed injury. According to the Denis classification, 64 patients were of compression fractures, and 39 patients of burst fractures. There were 5 cases had fractures in T(11), 30 in T(12), 42 in L(1), 15 in L(2), 4 in L(3), 3 in L(4), 2 in T(11-12), 1 in L(1-2), and 1 in L(2-3). Radiological examinations, including X-ray and CT examinations, and clinical examinations were carried out to evaluate the therapeutic effects. RESULTS: Twenty one patients were lost to follow up, the remaining were followed up from 10 to 48 months with an average of 27.4 months. Before the operation, the vertebral height, the kyphosis angle and the occupation of spinal canal were (54.5 +/- 8.7){\%}, 16.4 degrees +/- 2.9 degrees and 1.2 +/- 1.0, and were improved to (88.6 +/- 6.4){\%}, 11.6 degrees +/- 2.7 degrees and 0.5 +/- 0.6 respectively after the operation. Preoperatively the visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index were 8.0 +/- 1.2 and 41.2 +/- 9.3, and were improved to 1.7 +/- 1.8 and 6.7 +/- 5.6 postoperatively, respectively. All of these values between pre- and post-operatively were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.01). Screw misplacement was found in 7 patients, superficial wound infection in 1, screw breakage in 3, screw dislodgment in 2, cement leakage in 5, transient neurological symptoms in 4, and 8 patients with low back pain remained, of which 2 patients required occasional oral analgesics. Bone fusion achieved in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical efficacy of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is similar with conventional open surgery. With the advantages of convenient procedure, less invasive, and rapid recovery, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is an alternative method for thoracolumbar fractures without neurological deficits.},

METHODS: From June 2007 to December 2008, 19 cases of thoracolumbar fractures were treated with transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite grafting and pedicle screw fixation via paraspinal approach. There were 7 female and 12 male, ranging from 21 to 57 years of age (mean 40.8 years) at surgery. The time from injury to surgery varied from 1 d to 5 d (mean 2.9 d). Nineteen patients all suffered from single thoracolumbar fracture with the distribution of injury level being T(11) in 1, T(12) in 5, L(1) in 9, and L(2) in 4. According to Denis fracture classification, there were 5 compression fractures and 14 burst fractures. The mean preoperative ratio of the anterior height of the body was 57.2{\%}, kyphosis angle was 17.6 degrees and occupation of spinal canal was 27.7{\%}. The mean preoperative load-sharing classification of spine fractures was 5.2. Based on the ASIA neurologic grading system, preoperative neurological function was grade B in 2 cases, C in 9 and D in 8. RESULTS: Median operating time was 83.8 min (range 60-95 min) and median blood loss was 133 ml (range 90 - 200 ml). Infection did not occur in any of the patients and the operative incisions were healing well. Average follow-up time was 19.2 months (range 12 - 36 months). At the latest follow-up, the height of the anterior border was corrected to 88.4{\%}, the kyphosis angle was 6.1 degrees , and the occupation of spinal canal was 8.2{\%} on average. The postoperative neurologic function of all 19 patients was improved with grade D in 2 cases and E in 17. There were no instances of instrumentation failure and no patient had persistent postoperative back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite grafting and pedicle screw fixation via paraspinal approach could provide reliable neurologic improvement in patients with incomplete neurologic deficit, and could prevent the development of kyphosis.Furthermore, it has the obvious advantages of less invasive and blood loss, and decreases the risks of postoperative lumbodorsal pain.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Vertebral endplate tissues were obtained from patients with degenerated lumbar disc classified as Modic type 1 or type 2 and investigated with immunohistochemical staining and the DNA nick end labelling techniques. OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of fas receptor (FasR) and apoptosis in the endplate cells isolated from patients with degenerative disc disease and to see whether they are associated with the pathological change of endplate. METHODS: Fifty-six degenerated lumbar endplate specimens were obtained from the patients with degenerative disc disease categorized as type Modic I or II in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eight nondegenerated specimens as control (vertebra burst fracture patients without degenerative change in MRI) during surgical procedures. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the presence of FasR and apoptosis in sections of those endplate tissues. To investigate whether the FasR expression and apoptosis in endplate were influenced by degeneration and ageing of the discs, the level of FasR expression and apoptosis in the changed and unchanged endplates was analysed. RESULTS: FasR were expressed in the cytoplasm of the endplate cells. A higher degree of FasR expression and apoptosis in endplate cells in degenerated discs was found than that in nondegenerated discs. In cell culture, the level of FasR expression and apoptosis in cells from the degenerative endplates was higher than those in unchanged endplates. The percentage of FasR-positive endplate and apoptotic endplate cells correlated significantly with the patient's age (r=0.301, p{\textless}0.05; r=0.307, p{\textless}0.05. respectively), but not with the degree of disc degeneration in MRI (r=0.047, p{\textgreater}0.05; r=0.066, p{\textgreater}0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare the expression of FasR and apoptosis on vertebral endplate cells in degenerated disc with in nondegenerated disc. The results show that the endplate in degenerated disc may undergo fas-mediated apoptosis and vice versa, endplate degenerative changes may promotes apoptosis of the endplate cells within degenerated disc.},

METHODS: The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from 170 cases of thoracolumbar fracture treated with posterior surgical treatment between January 2005 and January 2009. There were 119 males and 51 females with an average age of 42.7 years (range, 17-68 years). The fracture locations included TI1 in 22 cases, T12 in 30 cases, L1 in 57 cases, and L2 in 61 cases. According to Denis classification system, there were 65 cases of compression fractures, 44 cases of burst fractures, 25 cases of flexion-distraction injuries, and 36 cases of fracture-dislocations. The time from injury to operation was 3-8 days (mean, 4.4 days). All the cases were divided into 4 groups according to space-occupying rates of spinal cord: group A, {\textless} or = 20{\%} (n = 32); group B, 21{\%}-40{\%} (n = 68); group C, 41{\%}-60{\%} (n = 37); and group D, {\textgreater} or = 61{\%} (n = 33). Through statistical analysis, the correlation between space-occupying rates and spinal cord function (Frankel grade) was evaluated, and the necessities of spinal cord decompression was studied in the patients who had neurological symptoms with space-occupying rates under 40{\%}. RESULTS: There was no positive correlation between the degree of spinal cord injury and the space-occupying rates of bone fragments broken into the spinal canal. All patients were followed up 13-41 months (mean, 23.5 months). During the follow-up period, no secondary neurological damage occurred in the patients who were not given posterior spinal cord decompression with space-occupying rates under 40{\%} (28 cases). And also in the cohort of patients with neurological symptoms whose space-occupying rates were under 40{\%}, the posterior spinal cord decompression (65 cases) could improve the spinal cord function significantly when compared with no decompression cohort (7 cases), (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The relative indications of posterior spinal cord decompression for thoracolumbar fracture are as follows: the cases having neurological symptoms with space-occupying rates under 40{\%} and the ones having the neurological symptoms or not with space-occupying rates above 40{\%}.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A systematic quantitative review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: To compare combined anterior-posterior surgery versus posterior surgery for thoracolumbar fractures in order to identify better treatments. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Axial load of the anterior and middle column of the spine can lead to a burst fracture in the vertebral body. The management of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. The goals of operative treatment are fracture reduction, fixation and decompressing the neural canal. For this, different operative methods are developed, for instance, the posterior and the combined anterior-posterior approach. Recent systematic qualitative reviews comparing these methods are lacking. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. RESULTS: Five observational comparative studies and no randomized clinical trials comparing the combined anteriorposterior approach with the posterior approach were retrieved. The total enrollment of patients in these studies was 755 patients. The results were expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). CONCLUSIONS: A small significantly higher kyphotic correction and improvement of vertebral height (sagittal index) observed for the combined anterior-posterior group is cancelled out by more blood loss, longer operation time, longer hospital stay, higher costs and a possible higher intra- and postoperative complication rate requiring re-operation and the possibility of a worsened Hannover spine score. The surgeons' choices regarding the operative approach are biased: worse cases tended to undergo the combined anterior-posterior approach.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors that have a significant correlation with the severity of neurologic impairment in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The correlation between spinal canal stenosis due to bony fragments and the severity of neurologic deficits in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures remains controversial. Moreover, there have so far been no reports in the literature in which the risk factors (spinal canal stenosis and the disruption of posterior ligamentous complex) causing a severe neurologic deficit were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model. METHODS: A review of the clinical data (neurologic impairments on admission and a finding of posterior ligamentous complex disruption at the time of operation), axial computed tomography, and plain lateral radiography of 216 patients in thoracolumbar (T11-L1) and lumbar (L2-L5) burst fractures was performed. The factors related to neurologic impairments were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: In all cases, both the spinal canal stenosis (P {\textless} 0.01) and disruption of posterior ligamentous complex (P {\textless} 0.01) were significant risk factors. Interestingly, these two risk factors varied according to the injury levels: at thoracic level, the spinal canal stenosis (P {\textless} 0.01); at the first lumbar spine, the disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex (P {\textless} 0.01); and at the lumbar spine below L2, both of the spinal canal stenosis (P {\textless} 0.01) and the disruption of posterior ligamentous complex (P {\textless} 0.05) were significant risk factors, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures, the significance of the two important risk factors related to clinical results, namely, the stenosis ratio of spinal canal and the disruption of posterior ligamentous complex, were found to vary depending on the level of injury.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcome, effectiveness, and security of the surgical management of acute thoracolumbar burst fracture with corpectomy, titanic mesh autograft, and Z-plate fixation by anterior approach. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many surgical methods were adopted to treat acute burst thoracolumbar fracture. But the optimal surgical management remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of 48 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture treated with anterior corpectomy, titanic mesh autograft, and Z-plate internal fixation was carried out. Preoperative clinical and radiographic data of all cases were originally collected. Surgical indications were motor neurologic deficit and thoracolumbar column instability. Twenty-two patients (45.8{\%}) with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures presented with a neurologic deficit. The postoperative recovery of neural function, restoration of anterior cortex collapse, kyphotic angle, and spinal canal compromise were observed. RESULTS: The preoperative kyphotic angle was improved to a mean of 5.6 degrees , radiographic height restored to 95.8{\%} of the adjacent normal levels, and canal compromise was 0{\%}. None of the patients had neurologic deterioration. Mean follow-up time was 32.4 months (range, 24-47 months). All 22 patients with neurologic deficit demonstrated at least one Frankel grade improvement on final observation, with 16 (73{\%}) patients had accomplished complete neurologic recovery. Forty-six (96{\%}) patients reported minimal or no pain at final follow-up observation, and 40 (83{\%}) patients who had been working before injury returned to original work. CONCLUSION: The authors considered spinal cord decompression with anterior corpectomy and stability reconstruction with titanic mesh autograft and Z-plate fixation at same time in one incision as an effective technique for unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture with and without neurologic deficit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and the value of balloon kyphoplasty in  treating aged osteoporosis thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and January 2008, 36 thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture patients were treated. There were 15 males and 21 females with an average age of 65.4 years (range, 59-72 years). Fourteen cases had no obvious history of trauma, 19 had a history of slight trauma, and 3 had a history of severe trauma. Forty vertebral bodies were involved, including 1 T7, 3 T9, 8 T10, 10 T12, 9 L1, 7 L2, and 2 L4. All patients displayed local pain and osteoporosis by bone density measurement with no neurological symptom of both lower limbs. Balloon kyphoplasty through unilateral (31 cases) or bilateral (5 cases) vertebral pedicles with polymethylmethacrylate was performed at the injection volume of (3.46 +/- 0.86) mL per vertebral body. Before and after operation, the anterior height and posterior height of fractured vertebral body and the sagittal displacement were measured. RESULTS: Two cases had intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage; 1 case had no remission of waist-back pain and pain was released after symptomatic treatment. All 36 patients were followed up 2.3 years on average (range, 1.5-4.0 years). No cement leakage was found with good diffusion of cement on X-ray film. The restoration of the height of vertebral bodies was satisfactory without nerve compression symptoms and other complications. The Visual Analogue Score at last follow-up (2.34 +/- 1.03) was significantly lower than that of preoperation (6.78 +/- 1.21), (P {\textless} 0.05). The compressive percentage of anterior height (19.80{\%} +/- 1.03{\%}) of fractured vertebral body after operation was significantly lower than that before operation (25.30{\%} +/- 2.50{\%}), (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant difference in posterior compressive percentage and sagittal displacement between pre- and post- operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on roentgenographic scores, balloon kyphoplasty is selectively used to treat aged osteoporosis thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture, and the radiographic and clinical results were satisfactory.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The characteristics, diagnosis, classification and treatment options of rare fractures of the sacrum known as suicidal jumper's fractures are presented based on six illustrative cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Jumper's fractures of the sacrum are characterised by an H- or U-shaped fracture line in the upper sacrum, usually involving the S1-S2 region. Typically, the anterior segment of the pelvic ring is not injured. In most cases this injury is associated with polytrauma and it is imperative that the patients undergo thorough neurological examination including that for perineal sensitivity and anal tone. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2007, 109 patients were treated for AO/OTA type C pelvic injuries at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology. A bilateral fracture of the sacrum with a typical fracture line, i.e., suicidal jumper's fracture, was recorded in six patients (5.5 {\%}), which accounts for 1.2 {\%} of the total number of the pelvic fractures treated. Five patients underwent surgery, one was treated conservatively. Neurological deficit was recorded in five of the six patients. Surgery resulted in bone union and overall improvement in five patients, the patient treated conservatively showed lasting neurological deficit with no progression; she developed pseudoarthrosis. DISCUSSION: Transverse fracture of the sacrum, in the literature referred to as suicidal jumper's fracture, is a rare injury. In 1985 Roy-Camille introduced a classification system for sacral fractures. In the classification proposed by Denis et al., transalar, transforaminal and central fractures are distinguished, with transverse fractures being included. For making exact diagnosis, the AO/OTA classification is necessary. There is a wide range of neurological features associated with displaced sacral fractures. It includes motor and sensory deficit in L5 and S1 dermatomes and myotomes, dysfunction of the sphincters, perineal insensitivity and possibly also sexual dysfunction. Based on the Denis classification, zone I fractures are responsible for 5.9 {\%}, zone II fractures for 28.4 {\%} and zone III fractures for 56.7 {\%} of the neurological deficits associated with sacral injuries. In patients with zone III fractures, urinary bladder innervation and sexual dysfunction are recorded in 76 {\%}, and neurological deficit in 41 {\%}, of which two-thirds are motor neuron lesions. Motor deficits are most often due to L5 and S1 root lesions; sensory deficits result from S2-S5 and L5 root lesions. External rotation and vertical displacement produce a traction mechanism, comminution and impaction of the massa lateralis result in nerve compression. Sacral fractures can be treated conservatively or surgically. Conservative therapy, bed rest, traction and gradual physical therapy are indicated in children and adolescents with non-displaced or slightly displaced sacral fractures, either without or with minimal neurological symptoms. Surgical treatment involving nerve decompression, open reduction of the fracture and subsequent fixation of the fragments is indicated in all displaced fractures. When nerve structures are affected, the injury-surgery interval should not exceed six hour. CONCLUSIONS: Sacral fractures known as suicidal jumper's fractures are rare but very serious injuries difficult to diagnose. All injured patients should undergo a thorough neurological examination, including perineal sensitivity and anal tone. The treatment includes nerve decompression, fragment reduction and the restoration of sacral and pelvic stability necessary for neurological recovery, early rehabilitation and good clinical outcome.},

abstract = {We present the case of a 33-year-old male who sustained a burst fracture D12 vertebrae with spinal cord injury (ASIA impairment scale A) and a right mid-diaphysial femoral shaft fracture around 1.5 years back. The patient reported 1.5 years later with a swelling over the right buttock. Arthrotomy revealed serous fluid and fragmented bone debris. The biopsy showed a normal bony architecture with no evidence of infection and malignant cells. Hence, a diagnosis of Charcot's hip was made. Charcot's neuroarthropathy of the feet is a well-recognized entity in the setting of insensate feet resulting from causes such as diabetes or spina bifida. Although Charcot's disease of the hips has been described, it is uncommon in association with spinal cord injury, syphilis and even with the use of epidural injection. The present case highlights the fact that neuroarthropathy of the hip can occur in isolation in the setting of a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to considerable morbidity.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective registry. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine patient outcomes using a mini-open, lateral approach for the treatment of traumatic thoracic and lumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The high-quality published studies that examine treatment methods for acute traumatic thoracic and lumbar fractures are few and a few that are present contain insufficient samples to make broad conclusions. Despite this, we know that conventional surgical techniques often include large, morbid exposures. More recent advancements in less invasive surgical techniques have greatly decreased the associated morbidities of conventional approaches, namely, thoracotomy. METHODS: A total of 52 patients were treated at 1 of 2 institutions for traumatic thoracic or lumbar fractures with a mini-open lateral approach for corpectomy. Patients were prospectively followed for clinical outcomes, with treatment and in-hospital complications collected retrospectively. RESULTS: The majority of patients (94.2{\%}) presented with traumatic burst fractures with instability and neurologic deficit. Patients were treated with mini-open, lateral corpectomies from T7 to L4, the majority at T12 and L1, and were followed 2 years after surgery. Supplemental internal fixation was used in all patients: 75{\%} anterolateral plating and 46.1{\%} transpedicular fixation (11 [21.2{\%}] patients with combined). Median operative time, estimated blood loss, and hospital stay were 128 minutes, 300 mL, and 4 days, respectively. Complications were observed in 13.5{\%} of patients and no reoperations occurred. Neurologic status, assessed using American Spinal Injury Association categorization, improved significantly postoperatively, with 73{\%} of patients either completely neurologically intact or with only slight residual deficits (American Spinal Injury Association E or D). No patient experienced neurologic deterioration. Expandable wide-footprint titanium cages were used in 34.6{\%} of patients, which resisted radiographic subsidence seen in some patients treated with expandable cylindrical titanium cages. CONCLUSION: The mini-open lateral approach for thoracic and lumbar corpectomy was shown to be safe and effective in this series while avoiding many of the associated morbidities of thoracotomies for anterior column reconstruction and open posterior approaches.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In recent years, several massive earthquakes have occurred across the globe. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is reliable in detecting spinal injuries. The purpose of this study was to compare the features of spinal injuries resulting from the Sichuan earthquake with those of non-earthquake-related spinal trauma using MDCT. METHODS: Features of spinal injuries of 223 Sichuan earthquake-exposed patients and 223 non-earthquake-related spinal injury patients were retrospectively compared using MDCT. The date of non-earthquake-related spinal injury patients was collected from 1 May 2009 to 22 July 2009 to avoid the confounding effects of seasonal activity and clothing. We focused on anatomic sites, injury types and neurologic deficits related to spinal injuries. Major injuries were classified according to the grid 3-3-3 scheme of the Magerl (AO) classification system. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients (82.96{\%}) in the earthquake-exposed cohort experienced crush injuries. In the earthquake and control groups, 65 and 92 patients, respectively, had neurologic deficits. The anatomic distribution of these two cohorts was significantly different (P {\textless} 0.001). Cervical spinal injuries were more common in the control group (risk ratio (RR) = 2.12, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas lumbar spinal injuries were more common in the earthquake-related spinal injuries group (277 of 501 injured vertebrae; 55.29{\%}). The major types of injuries were significantly different between these cohorts (P = 0.002). Magerl AO type A lesions composed most of the lesions seen in both of these cohorts. Type B lesions were more frequently seen in earthquake-related spinal injuries (RR = 1.27), while we observed type C lesions more frequently in subjects with non-earthquake-related spinal injuries (RR = 1.98, P = 0.0029). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal injuries sustained in the Sichuan earthquake were located mainly in the lumbar spine, with a peak prevalence of type A lesions and a high occurrence of neurologic deficits. The anatomic distribution and type of spinal injuries that varied between earthquake-related and non-earthquake-related spinal injury groups were perhaps due to the different mechanism of injury.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) for thoracolumbar AO type A3 fractures with a specially designed surgical instrument system. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgery including PPSF is becoming increasingly widespread in the spine surgery. The technique of PPSF was mostly used as supplemental fixation combined with minimally invasive posterior or anterior lumbar interbody fusion in management of lumbar degenerative disorders. There are fewer studies available in literature regarding PPSF without additional kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty for management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Thirty-six adult patients, who had single thoracolumbar AO type A3 fractures and the load-sharing score of 6 or less, underwent application of percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw fixation. Radiologic parameters including kyphotic angle and vertebral height loss were assessed before and after surgery, and functional outcome was evaluated by Prolo questionnaire. RESULTS: All patients were successfully managed with percutaneous minimal invasive procedures. The average operative time was 78 minutes (range 62 to 117 min). The average intraoperative blood loss was 75 mL (range 50 to 220 mL). After a mean follow-up of 48.5 months (range 32 to 63 mo), 31 of 36 (86.1{\%}) patients had a satisfactory result (19 excellent and 12 good) and 5 of them fair. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical results suggest that PPSF can be an alternative for management of thoracolumbar AO type A3 fractures that have no neurologic deficits. With a specially designed percutaneous instrument and pedicle screw system, the procedure has been proved as relatively safe and a minimally invasive approach for the management of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study  was to evaluate prospectively a large group of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures who were treated with a posterior/anterior combined procedure and to report on the surgical outcomes, complications and radiographic results. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients were surgically managed with posterior instrumentation, anterior decompression and anterior strut grafting. There were 71 males and 29 females; the mean age was 36 years. Patients with osteoporotic delayed vertebral body collapse were excluded. The mean follow-up period was 30 months. Surgical outcomes such as operative time, blood loss and sagittal alignment were investigated. A neurological assessment was performed by a rating system based on the American Spine Injury Association impairment scale. An interbody fusion was judged using plain X-ray and computed tomographic scans. RESULTS: The mean operative time was 256 min and the mean operative bleeding was 985 ml. Most of the patients were ambulatory within 3 days after surgery. Of the 76 patients with neurological injury, 54 (71.1{\%}) recovered function following surgery. The mean local kyphosis angle was 12.2 degrees kyphotic preoperatively and 0.8 degrees lordotic at the final observation. The mean correction angle was 15.7 degrees and correction loss was 2.6 degrees . No instrumentation failure was observed and the postoperative fusion rate was 99{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior/anterior combined surgery with posterior pedicle screws and hooks fixation, and reconstruction by simultaneous strut grafting and anterior decompression, achieved short segment fixation and can be a useful option for surgically treating thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

  abstract = {Personnel dose in diagnostic radiology is often underestimated. Typically the effective dose E is estimated based on dosimeters worn underneath the protective clothing measuring the personal dose equivalent Hp(10). This one-spot-measurement systematically neglects the exposure to the unshielded organs in the head and neck region. In this paper, energy dependent double dosimetry algorithms in the range of 30-80 keV are derived using organ dose conversion coefficients. The doses of shielded organs are assigned to a single dosimeter in the anterior thoracic region (chest) underneath the apron (Hp,c,u), and the doses of the organs not shielded are assigned to another dosimeter placed on the front area of the neck over the protective garment (Hp,n,o) with E = a1 Hp,c,u(10) + a2 Hp,n,o(10).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the morphological feature of complicated thoracolumbar fractures and the fixation technology of injured vertebra. METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2007, 61 patients with type B and C thoracolumbar fractures according to AO classification were treated. There were 53 males and 8 females, with a mean age of 33.2 years (range, 9 to 65 years). Based on ASIA grading system of neurologic deficit, Grade A was found in 41 cases, grade B in 5 cases, Grade C in 5 cases, Grade D in 6 cases and Grade E in 4 cases. The injured vertebra located at thoracic region in 13, thoracolumbar in 39 and lumbar in 9 cases. The patients were divided into two groups: 32 cases with pedicle screws in the injured vertebra and 29 cases without pedicle screw in the injured vertebra. The analyses on the morphological features of injured vertebra were performed, and comparisons were carried out on the outcome regarding the reduction and correction of the injured vertebra, and the difference of Denis scale in pain domain and work status domain, between the two groups. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for an average of 3 years (range, 1.5 to 4.5 years). There were significance statistical difference in the correction loss of Cobb angle, sagittal index, correction of dislocation index, and the Denis pain scale between the two groups (P {\textless} 0.05). A better outcome was observed in the injured vertebra fixation group than the injured vertebra non-fixation group. CONCLUSIONS: Inserting pedicle screws in the injured vertebra is effective and useful in the correction of complicated thoracolumbar fractures. It improves biomechanical stability of the spine after the operation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Unstable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine may be treated surgically. Vertebral body replacements (VBRs) give anterior column support and, when used with supplemental fixation, impart rigidity to the injured segments. Although some VBRs are expandable, device congruity to the vertebral end plates is imprecise and may lead to stress risers and device subsidence. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the rigidity of a VBR that self-adjusts to the adjacent vertebral end plates versus structural bone allograft and with an unsupported anterior column in a traumatic burst fracture reconstruction model. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical flexibility testing with rod strain measurement. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twelve T11-L3 human spine segments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Range of motion, neutral zone, and posterior fixation rod stress (moments). METHODS: Flexibility testing was performed to +/- 6 Nm in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation on 12 intact human T11-L3 specimens. Burst fractures were created in L1, and flexibility testing was repeated in three additional states: subtotal corpectomy with posterior instrumentation (PI) only from T12 to L2, reconstruction with a femoral strut allograft and PI, and reconstruction with a VBR (with self-adjusting end plates) and PI. The PI consisted of pedicle screws and strain gage instrumented rods that were calibrated to measure rod stress via flexion-extension bending moments. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in range of motion or neutral zone between the strut graft and VBR constructs, which both had less motion than the PI-only construct in flexion/extension and torsion and were both less than the intact values in flexion/extension and lateral bending (p {\textless} .05). Posterior rod moments were significantly greater for the PI-only construct in flexion/extension relative to the strut graft and VBR states (p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: This study, which simulated the immediate postoperative state, suggests that a VBR with self-adjusting end plate components has rigidity similar to the standard strut graft when combined with PI. Posterior rod stress was not significantly increased with this type of VBR compared with the strut graft reconstruction. The benefits of burst fracture stabilization using a self-adjusting VBR ultimately will not be known until long-term clinical studies are performed.},

For radiologists and surgeons who work closely together, only a few classifications of injury patterns have been shown to be useful enough to provide rapid and stable therapy decisions. Many classifications are too complex to be practical for day-to-day practice, such as the Magerl classification, which has been adopted by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO). Not least because of this classification difficulty, eponyms and synonyms are widely used to describe trauma of the spine, comparable to the number of terms used to describe fractures of the upper and lower limbs. The members of trauma teams should be aware of the definitions of these terms as well as the strengths and limitations of the existing classifications of spinal trauma.},

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Spine Unit, Orthopaedic Department, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, from April 2001 to December 2008. METHODOLOGY: Data of all new non-disaster spinal injury patient admissions, kept in a custom-built database at Spine Unit, was analyzed. Demography, type of injuries and their management was described in percentages. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty one non-disaster patients were selected out of a total 671 new admissions with spinal injuries. Mean age was 39.1 years and 77{\%} were males. Mechanisms of injury included; fall in 62{\%} and road traffic accidents in 32{\%}. Fracture dislocations and burst fractures were equally distributed (36{\%} each). Most of the injuries (43.6{\%}) were at T11-L1 level. Forty three percent patients had complete spinal cord injury (SCI), 33{\%} had incomplete SCI and 24{\%} did not have any SCI. Eight patients had concomitant spinal injury at a different level. Twelve percent patients had associated other major injuries. Seventy percent patients were treated surgically. Average follow-up was for 4 years. CONCLUSION: Non-disaster spinal injury was frequent in young males usually due to fall or road traffic accident. It involved fracture dislocation or burst fracture at T11-L1, level in most cases requiring surgical treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact on respiratory function of gunshot injuries to the chest is unknown. The objective is to assess pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength (RMS) in patients who have recently sustained an isolated gunshot injury to the chest. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients with isolated gunshot injuries to the chest were prospectively identified. Study patients underwent pulmonary function testing and an assessment of RMS and gas exchange. RESULTS: Ten male patients sustaining an isolated pulmonary gunshot wound were prospectively enrolled with a mean age of 29 years +/- 10 years and mean Injury Severity Score of 15 +/- 5. All patients had an associated pneumothorax (n = 1), hemothorax (n = 4), or a combination of both (n = 5). After removal of all thoracostomy tubes and before discharge [7.4 days +/- 5.4 days (range, 2-21 days)], patients underwent respiratory function testing. Lung volume subdivisions were reduced by 25{\%} to 60{\%} of predicted and diffusion capacity by 37{\%} with preservation of the normal ratio of diffusion capacity to alveolar volume. In the six subjects able to perform spirometry in seated and supine postures, forced vital capacity decreased by 20{\%} when changing posture (p = 0.046). Arterial blood gas analysis showed significant reduction in the P(AO)(2)/FIO(2) ratio (or increase in AaDO(2)). Maximal respiratory pressures were severely reduced from predicted values, the maximal inspiratory pressure by 60{\%} and the maximal expiratory pressure by 78{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Lung volumes and RMS are decreased moderately to severely in patients who have sustained an isolated pulmonary gunshot wound. Expiratory muscle force generation is more severely affected than inspiratory muscle force. Further investigation of the long-term impact of these injuries on respiratory function is warranted.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: in a prospective study the findings of the preoperative ultrasound examination were compared to the intraoperative findings. RESULTS: over a period of 2 years a total of 24 patients with 27 thoracolumbar fractures (18 type A, 9 type B) were examined. In 22 cases ultrasound examination was possible and correct ultrasound findings were made in 20 cases (91{\%}). The sensitivity was 83.3{\%}, specificity 93.8{\%}, positive predictive value 83.3{\%} and negative predictive value 93.8{\%}.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between neurological deficits and the severity of narrowing of the spinal canal in patients with thoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbar burst-type fractures by comparing the classifications of Denis and Magerl. From 1989 to 2005, a total of 227 patients with burst fractures following Denis' criteria were studied. SETTING: Tertiary teaching institution. METHODS: Computed tomographic scans of the fractured spine were analyzed to assess the narrowing of the spinal canal. Following Magerl's criteria, patients were later subdivided into two groups according to the presence of associated ligament injuries, out of which 185 patients had no such injuries and the remaining 42 patients were classified as Megerl group B. RESULTS: Results were evaluated based on the initial neurological status of patients according to Frankel and based on the midsagittal diameter of the fractured vertebra. A significant correlation was found between the narrowing of the spinal canal and neurological deficits in both classifications, with no significant differences between either. CONCLUSION: The percentage of narrowing of the spinal canal proved to be a pre-disposing factor for the severity of the neurological status in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst-type fractures according to the classifications of Denis and Magerl. The greater the bone fragment in the spinal canal, the greater will be the probability of neurological deficits in both fracture classifications, equally.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, correlational, exploratory, clinical research. OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors determining a patient's recovery after conservative treatment of compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The reported results of compression fractures are poor. These results are not influenced by the severity of compression, the fracture site, or the residual deformity. Otherwise, the factors that determine a patient's recovery are unknown. METHODS: In 48 conservatively treated patients the preinjury versus the 12-month follow-up differences (Delta) in back pain (visual analogue scale for pain), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and the Greenough and Fraser low back outcome scale were prospectively recorded. For these differences and for time lost from work and satisfaction, multiple linear regressions with combinations of 16 factors were performed. RESULTS: At 1 year, patients with an income-insurance were 9{\%} (P = 0.096) more disabled than those without. They reported a 15{\%} less favorable global outcome and 27{\%} less participation. Smokers were 13{\%} (P = 0.010) more disabled and 11{\%} (P = 0.044) less satisfied. With each increase of the AO-fracture type from A1 to A3 the disability was 8{\%} worse. Patients with pre-existent chronic low back pain (CLBP) returned two points (on a visual analogue scale [VAS] pain total of 10) more closely (P = 0.041) to their preinjury pain level than those without but were 21{\%} (P = 0.001) less satisfied. Our model offers an explanation for more than 25{\%} of the variability of DeltaODI and of the satisfaction. For sick leave, no significant predictors were found. CONCLUSION: Smoking and insurance status are the strongest negative predictors for recovery. LBP patients returned more closely to their preinjury back pain level, but were less satisfied. The AO fracture type had a marked influence on disability, the sagittal deformity had not. The time lost from work did not depend on patient or injury-related factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

abstract = {Thoracolumbar burst fracture (TLBF) is a common type of spinal injuries and frequently causes spinal cord injury. The frequency of neurological deficits in all TLBF can reach up to 50-60{\%}. The typical TLBF images seen on axial computerized tomography are the bone fragment projected into the spinal canal, which always persuade surgeons that the narrowed canal must compress the neural content and therefore is responsible for neurological deficits, with the corollary that surgical decompression of spinal canal is an essential therapeutic strategy for functional recovery. We hypothesize that in TLBF, traumatic canal stenosis is a predictive factor for neurological dysfunction and the surgical decompression is vital to the recovery of neurological function. After a review of the available evidences, we conclude that spinal canal stenosis is poorly correlated with neurological dysfunction in TLBF, and surgical decompression is not vital to the neurological recovery. Therefore, traumatic canal stenosis should not be an isolated indication for surgical decompression in TLBF.},

METHODS: From March 2004 to March 2008,10 patients with serious burst thoracolumbar fracture, including 7 males and 3 females with age for 24-58 years (mean 41 years)were treated by posterior pedicle screw fixation, transpedicular bone grafting and total laminectomy with preservation of spinal process and vertebral canaloplasty with ilium autografting. The operative effects were assessed according to Frankel classification and radiologic results. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 1 to 4 years. There was no loosening or broken in instrumentation. The anterior edge height of the fractured vertebrae body was restored from (21.00 +/- 12.00){\%} to (95.00 +/- 4.20){\%}, and the posterior edge height of the fractured vertebrae body was restored from (70.00 +/- 15.00){\%} to (96.00 +/- 3.20){\%} postoperatively, which both demonstrated improvement compared with preoperative instance (P {\textless} 0.01). The Cobb angle was restored from (32.80 +/- 8.20) degrees to (4.20 +/- 1.60) degrees which also demonstrated improvement compared with the preoperative Cobb angle (P {\textless} 0.01). At least one grade recovery was observed in all cases except one patient with preoperative Frankel A degree. The result of Denis classification, P1, had 4 cases, P2 had 4, P3 had 1, P4 had 1. CONCLUSION: Posterior pedicle screw fixation, transpedicular bone grafting and vertebral canaloplasty can obtain satisfactory results treating serious burst thoracolumbar fractures. It is a feasible method with advantages of simple operation, good efficacy, preservation of structure of posterior column which should be applied clinically.},

The current study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of indirect reduction without fusion. Sixty-four patients with single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures were identified and treated by this method. The outcome was analyzed by the Frankel method, radiographic measurements, and at the latest follow-up the Denis Pain Scale and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess back pain and functional outcome. The average follow-up period was 40.1 months. The anterior vertebral height (AVH) was corrected from 55.2 to 97.2{\%} post-operatively and decreased to 88.9{\%} after hardware removal. The posterior vertebral height (PVH) increased from 88.9 to 99.1{\%} post-operatively and decreased slightly after implant removal to 93.7{\%}. The average pre-operative canal compromise was 41.4{\%}, which decreased to 13.7{\%} at last follow-up. Except for three paraplegic patients, neurological status significantly improved or stayed normal in the study's remaining 61 patients. Fifty-two of sixty-four patients had excellent or good function. At latest follow-up the average ODI score was 16.7 and the Denis pain score improved in all patients but one. Indirect reduction and fixation can not only restore vertebral column structure but also, more importantly, patients' functional outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries of thoracic vertebrae in multiple trauma patients are often  accompanied by severe thoracic injuries and sensorimotor deficits. However, until now, it is not clear whether and how the severity of trauma influences the neurologic and functional outcome in paraplegic patients during the first year after the trauma. The aim of the study was to compare two cohorts of multiple injured paraplegic patients with and without conversion in the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) with regard to the severity of spinal trauma, the severity of thorax trauma, the type of fracture, and the functional outcome 1 year after the date of injury. METHODS: Twenty-one traumatic paraplegic patients (neurologic level T1-T12) were included in the study based on a retrospective analysis of the Heidelberg European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury database (www.emsci.org) from 2002 to 2007. In all patients, the Polytraumaschluessel (PTS), the AO classification, the AIS, and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure were collected. Patients with no change in the AIS (group 1, n=14) were compared with patients with AIS changes (group 2, n=7), and t test and chi test were performed (p{\textless}0.05). RESULTS: Differences in both groups concerning fracture classification were confirmed (p=0.046). A relation between neurologic improvement in the AIS and the severity of trauma (p=0.058) after 1 year was not found. The subitem PTST in the thoracic area showed statistical significance comparing the two groups (p=0.005). Both groups significantly improved functionally (Spinal Cord Independence Measure, p=0.035) during the first year but with no significant difference between the groups after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that functional improvement is achieved independently from neurologic recovery. The combined assessment of the PTS, the AO classification, and the AIS in multiple-injured paraplegic patients can contribute to provide a better prognostication of the neurologic changes during rehabilitation and the outcome after 1 year than the AIS alone.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective radiographic review. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether  clinical factors or common classification systems can predict the radiologic outcome of short-segment thoracolumbar fracture fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous reports have indicated that short-segment thoracolumbar fracture fixation might not be appropriate for highly comminuted fractures or for patients with multiple traumatic injuries. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective radiographic review of 46 thoracolumbar fractures treated with short-segment posterior instrumentation to determine the rate of correction loss and instrumentation failure in relation to the Load Sharing Classification of Spine Fracture system and the AO Classification of Fractures system. No postoperative bracing was used. Patients with multisystem organ trauma and those with isolated injuries were included. RESULTS: An average loss of correction of 7.5 degree was observed. Pedicle screw placement into the fractured vertebra seemed to protect against correction loss: 4 of the 7 patients (57{\%}) in the no intermediate fixation group had {\textgreater}10 degree loss of correction. No relationship was shown between loss of correction and Load Sharing Classification ({\textless} or = 6 or {\textgreater} or = 7 points), loss of correction and AO Classification, or loss of correction and level of injury (thoracolumbar junction vs. lower lumbar). CONCLUSIONS: With modern instrumentation and techniques, short-segment thoracolumbar fracture fixation could be used successfully, despite highly comminuted injuries, without anterior column support or supplemental bracing.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: So far, the Load-Sharing Classification (LSC) has been the commonest method employed to identify indication for anterior replacement of vertebral bodies in thoracolumbar spine fractures. The aim of this study was to verify reliability of the LSC method in indications for anterior replacement surgery. METHODS: Fractures were examined using x-ray, CT and MRI methods. The prospective study included only patients with type A3 comminuted fractures (AO classification) of the thoracolumbar vertebrae (Th11-L2), with MRI confirmed grade 3 or 4 intervertebral disc injuries (according to Oner) and with no concomitant nerve injuries. All fractures were treated using isolated posterior transpedicular (TP) fixation. 18 months after the procedure, angulation of the regional kyphosis, screw rupturing, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores at rest and under loading, Pain Scale (PS) scores and Work Scale (WS) scores were assessed. The study group included 42 patients aged 27-72 years (the mean age was 51.55 y.o.a.), 28 subjects were males and 14 females. Using the LSC classification system, the study group was divided into two subgroups, one including patients with LSC up to grade 6 - Group A (18 subjects) and the other one including patients with LSC 7 to 9 - Group B (24 subjects). RESULTS: Statistical assessment of clinical (PS, WS, VAS at rest and VAS after loading) and radiological findings (the degree of kyphotic changes) at month 18 identified no statistically significant correlations between the two subgroups. TP fixation failures (srews rupturing) occured only in Group A in two subjects. DISCUSSION: Based on the LSC, Group B was expected to have inferior outcomes, however, this was not the case in our study group. Therefore, it can be concluded that LSC is not a reliable predictor of the final clinical and radiological findings in the type A3 fractures with grade 3 or 4 TH-L intervertebral disc injuries. The defined LSC 6- point threshold for indications for anterior vertebral body and disc replacements is arguable. CONCLUSION: The authors do not consider the LSC method sufficiently reliable for determining indications for anterior replacements.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There has been minimal literature reporting on results of osteoporotic burst fracture with spinal canal compromise treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic burst fracture is controversial. We want to clarify whether the osteoporotic burst fracture with spinal canal compromise is a contraindication to percutaneous vertebroplasty. To compare the clinical and radiological results between osteoporotic burst and compression fractures treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 through 2006, 23 osteoporotic burst fracture patients with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise and 41 osteoporotic compression fracture patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. Pre- and post-operative pain scores, functional and radiographic results and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The average canal compromise in study group was 15{\%} (5-49{\%}). The mean post-operative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Score (VAS), kyphotic angle, vertebral body height measurement from the anterior, central and posterior part of the body are all significantly improved in both the study and control groups when compared to pre-operative data. However, there was no significant difference between study and control groups in pre- and post-operative ODI, VAS, kyphotic angle and improvement of body height. There were no significant differences (P=0.3797) in cement leakage rate between burst and compression groups (47.8{\%} vs 36.6{\%}). All the leakages were minor and without neurological deficit. The percentage of adjacent fractures in both groups also had no significant differences (39.1{\%} in burst and 41.5{\%} in compression group). CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic burst fracture with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise is not a contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplasty. This procedure is suitable for both osteoporotic burst and compression fracture with careful surgical technique.},

Methods From December 2007 to December 2009, 45 thoracolumbar fracture patients who underwent computed radiology (CR) and MSCT were recruited. There were 32 males and 13 females with a mean age of 48 years (range, 24-63 years), including 36 simple compression fractures and 9 burst fractures. The fracture locations were T11 in 6 cases, T12 in 11 cases, L1 in 20 cases, and L2 in 8 cases. Fracture was caused by traffic accident in 25 cases, by falling from height in 12 cases, and by others in 8 cases. The imaging examination was performed after 2 hours to 7 days of injury in 22 cases and after more than 7 days in 23 cases. The KA was measured on the lateral X-ray films of CR and MPR by two observers, then the measurements were done again after three weeks. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The average KA values on CR by two observers were (20.75 +/- 8.31)degrees and (22.49 +/- 9.07)degrees, respectively; showing significant difference (P {\textless} 0.05), and the correlation was good (r = 0.882, P {\textless} 0.05). The average KA values on MPR by two observers were (16.65 +/- 8.62)degrees and (17.08 +/- 7.88)degrees, respectively, showing no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05), the correlation was excellent (r = 0.976, P {\textless} 0.05). The average KA values on CR and MPR were (21.61 +/- 8.43)degrees and (16.87 +/- 8.20)degrees, respectively; showing significant difference (P {\textless} 0.05), the correlation was good (r = 0.852, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is more feasible and reliable in measuring the KA on MRP of MSCT than CR, but the value is larger on CR.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe a surgical technique of ASSDF and its clinical outcome in a group of neurologically deficient patients with Denis B type thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures is still controversial. METHODS: The canals of selected patients were fully decompressed with partial dissection on fractured vertebral body. Single segmental fusion was achieved with grafting and fixation. Clinical evaluation (including Frankel scales and visual analogue scale) and radiologic assessments (including the measurements of the kyphosis Cobb angle, adjacent superior, inferior intervertebral disc height, and vertebral canal sagittal diameter on radiograph film and computer tomography scans) were performed before the operation and at 3-day, 6-month, 1-, 2-, and 3-year intervals after the operation. RESULTS: Between June 2006 and May 2008, 37 patients with Denis B type thoracolumbar burst fractures were recruited for study. Thirty-four patients with successful ASSDF accomplished a 1-year follow-up. Average follow-up duration was 26 +/- 9.2 months. The average operation time and blood loss were 173 +/- 26 minutes and 445.6 +/- 164.4 mL, respectively. Average Frankel scales were significantly improved at the end of follow-up. visual analogue scale decreased from 7.2 +/- 0.8 before operation to less than 1.7 +/- 0.7 (P {\textless} 0.05) 6 months later. The vertebral canal sagittal diameter was enlarged from an average of 5.9 +/- 1.2 mm to 16.2 +/- 1.0 mm (P {\textless} 0.01). The canal stenosis index also improved, from 36.0{\%} to 99.1{\%}. Kyphosis was corrected from 21.5 degrees +/- 6.1 degrees to 7.3 degrees +/- 3.2 degrees (P {\textless} 0.05) and remained at 8.2 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees (P {\textgreater} 0.05) 1 year later. Adjacent disc heights remained constant. No serious complications or fixation failures were observed during follow-up.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When an anterior approach to repair a burst fracture is indicated, several devices can be used to restore spinal stability (eg, bone graft, free-standing titanium cage, and expandable titanium cage). OBJECTIVE: We compare the biomechanical stability and prices of each of these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight fresh human cadaver T11 through L3 vertebral specimens were harvested and cleaned of soft tissues. T11-T12 and L2-L3 were fixed by screws. The fixed ends were then set in automotive body filler (Bondo). The prepared specimens were tested in the Biaxial Instron tester (8874, Norwood, MA) after a sequence of the following: intact, after the creation of an anterior corpectomy at L1, and after insertion of both of the 2 different titanium cages and the fibular graft. A titanium screw-and-plate anterolateral system was used to secure the construct (VANTAGE, Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN). The conditions of displacement testing were as follows: rotation (+/- 3.5 degrees ), flexion and extension, and left and right bending (+/- 3.5 mm). For each mode of testing, the stiffness was calculated. RESULTS: The stiffness data, when statistically analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (at P = .05 and power {\textgreater} 0.9), indicated no significant differences among these devices. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this biomechanical study, the stiffness of the fibular graft was similar to that of the other metallic devices in this cadaver model.},

abstract = {The study design includes prospective evaluation of percutaneous osteosynthesis associated with cement kyphoplasty on 18 patients. The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of a percutaneous method of treating burst vertebral fractures in patients without neurological deficits. Even if burst fractures are frequent, no therapeutic agreement is available at the moment. We report in this study the results at 2 years with a percutaneous approach for the treatment of burst fractures. 18 patients were included in this study. All the patients had burst vertebral fractures classified type A3 on the Magerl scale, between levels T9 and L2. The patients' mean age was 53 years (range 22-78 years) and the neurological examination was normal. A percutaneous approach was systematically used and a kyphoplasty was performed via the transpedicular pathway associated with percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw osteosynthesis. The patients' follow-up included CT scan analysis, measurement of vertebral height recovery and local kyphosis, and clinical pain assessments. With this surgical approach, the mean vertebral height was improved by 25{\%} and a mean improvement of 11.28 degrees in the local kyphotic angle was obtained. 3 months after the operation, none of the patients were taking class II analgesics. The mean duration of their hospital stay was 4.5 days (range 3-7 days) and the mean follow-up period was 26 months (range 17-30 months). No significant changes in the results obtained were observed at the end of the follow-up period. Minimally invasive methods of treating burst vertebral fractures can be performed via the percutaneous pathway. This approach gives similar vertebral height recovery and kyphosis correction rates to those obtained with open surgery. It provides a short hospital stay, however, and might therefore constitute a useful alternative to open surgical methods.},

METHODS: From September 2005 to September 2007, 82 patients (male 50 and female 32, the age from 18 to 63 years, at mean age of 36 years,the courses of disease from 2 hours to 7 days with an average of 2 days) with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with posterior short segmental pedicle screw fixation adding pedicle screw at the fracture level. According to the AO classification, 25 patients were type A1 fracture, 48 were type A2 and 9 were type B2. According to the ASIA neurological function grading system, 9 patients were grade C, 17 were grade D and 56 were grade E. Reduction and posterolateral fusion were achieved through fixation of the fractured vertebra and the adjacent normal vertebrae with the transpedicle screw. RESULTS: Eighty-two cases were followed up from 12 to 24 months (averaged 18.3 months). All cases achieved bone fusion, without significant lose of the vertebrae body height and implant failure. The anterior body compression and Cobb angle were significantly improved after surgery (P {\textless} 0.05). The anterior body compression and Cobb angle did not significantly lose compared with after-surgery ones (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The caudal intervertebral disc height (h/H) were not significantly improved after surgery (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Improvement of one to two grades of neurological function was observed in patients with incomplete neurological injuries. CONCLUSION: Posterior short segmental pedicle screw fixation with pedicle screw at the fracture level is a safe and effective therapeutic option to treat thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, which can help to correct the kyphosis and maintain the reduction, and avoid the over-distraction of the contiguous discs.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the relationship among the neurologic status, the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (TLICS) score, and the Magerl/AO classification system. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: A wide range of classification schemes for thoracic and lumbar spine trauma have been described, but none has achieved widespread acceptance. A recent system proposed by Vaccaro et al has been developed to improve injury classification and guide surgical decision making. METHODS: Analysis of 49 patients treated surgically for thoracic and lumbar spine trauma from 2003 to 2009 in 2 spine trauma centers. Clinical and radiologic data were evaluated, classifying the trauma according to American Spinal Injury Association status, the Magerl/AO classification for fractures, and the TLICS score. RESULTS: The mean age was 37 years (range, 17-72). Thirty-five (71{\%}) patients had a thoracolumbar fracture (T11-L2). A posterior approach was used in all the cases. American Spinal Injury Association status remained unchanged in 44 (4 had some improvement and 1 worsened). A total of 61.1{\%} of the patients with a type A fracture were neurologically intact compared with 80{\%} with complete neurologic deficit for type C fractures. The TLICS score range from 2 to 9 (average of 6.2). Forty-seven of 49 (96{\%}) patients had a TLICS score greater than 4, suggesting surgical treatment. Seventy percentage of the patients with a TLICS score from 4 to 6 were neurologically intact compared with 87.5{\%} of complete neurologic deficits in patients with TLICS 7 to 9. A statistic correlation was established between the neurologic status and AO type fracture (P = 0.0041) and the TLICS score (P {\textless} 0.0001). An association between the AO type fracture and the TLICS score was also found (P = 0.0088). CONCLUSION: The TLICS score treatment recommendation matched surgical treatment in 47 of 49 patients (96{\%}). The TLICS was found to correlate to the AO classification. This suggests that the TLICS can be used to classify thoracolumbar trauma and can accurately predict surgical management.},

METHODS: This was a retrospective review based on the medical records and radiographs of 26 patients who underwent operations between January 1990 and December 2006. The parameters assessed were: worsening of kyphosis (Cobb), neurological dysfunction (Frankel) and failure of surgical treatment (implant breakage or loosening). RESULTS: No relationship was found between sagittal collapse and the scoring in the McCormack classification (r = 0.221; P = 0.322). There was also no relationship between failure of the posterior implant and the scoring in this classification (p = 0.85). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that this classification is not applicable to patients who underwent arthrodesis more than one level above and one level below the fracture.},

Hepatitis B (HBV) is probably the most common viral cause of FHF, while hepatitis A (HAV) virus seem occurs less frequently. However, the host and viral factors that determine the outcome of these infections are poorly understood. In the present study, viral load and genotyping determining regions of HAV and HBV genomes were sequenced. Eight FHF patients and one patient with severe acute hepatitis (SAH) were included. Liver and blood samples were collected during liver transplantation or necropsy procedures. HAV-RNA and HBV-DNA were extracted from serum, biopsy and paraffin liver. Nucleotide sequencing of HAV-RNA was performed from VP1/2A and HBV-DNA from PreS/S region. The amplified samples were quantified by Real-Time PCR. The cases of HAV infection were due to subgenotype IA. The cases of HBV infection were due to genotype A2 and D4. The case of HAV/HBV coinfection was infected by genotype IA and D3. Hepatitis A and B infection were associated with genotypes most prevalent in Brazil. In hepatitis A infection the mean of period evolution was 13 days. In hepatitis B, FHF patients infected by genotype D have a shorter period of evolution than FHF patients infected by genotype A (mean 15 v. 53 days). There was no association with genotype-determining region with the severity of hepatitis, however nucleotide differences and high viral load could be observed among FHF.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures are frequently classified as burst fractures Magerl type A3. There still are many controversies regarding the treatment of this fracture. The therapeutic spectrum ranges from conservative to invasive operative methods with attendant morbidities. The minimal-invasive technique of kyphoplasty has established itself as a common treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and is associated with a low complication rate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional and radiological results after kyphoplasty of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures type A3.1, A3.2 and A3.3, who were treated with kyphoplasty, were included in this study. The clinical outcome was measured at follow up with a neurological assessment, the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Score (ODI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. The radiological measurements, performed on preoperative, postoperative and follow up radiographs, included the sagittal index, the wedge angle and the modified Cobb angle of Daniaux. RESULTS: 26 patients with 23 A3.1, one A3.2 and five A3.3 fractures were treated between 2004 and 2007, including five patients with multiple vertebral fractures. At follow up the Oswestry Disability Score (26.2{\%}) and the SF-36 score (60.1{\%}) assessed a moderately limitation of functional outcome and quality of life without any neurological deficits. Radiological measurements showed a postoperative height restoration and reduction of kyphosis, but at follow up a secondary loss of correction except in five cases. Six minor ventrocranial cement leakages without further clinical consequence were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that kyphoplasty is a safe and feasible method for the treatment of burst fractures. It allowed the correction of the kyphosis, stabilisation of the facture, pain reduction and early mobilisation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hatchlings of the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata can endure long-term freezing of their extracellular body fluids. We hypothesized that freezing survival would include adaptive up-regulation of antioxidant defenses to deal with ischemia-reperfusion injuries associated with the freeze-thaw cycle. A number of antioxidant enzymes are under the control of the NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor including members of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) and aldo-keto reductase (AKR) families. METHODS: RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting were used to measure changes in transcript and protein levels in response to 5-h freezing exposure of hatchlings. RESULTS: Transcript levels of Nrf2 increased in turtle brain, liver, and muscle by 1.5- to 2-fold, and protein levels increased in the brain and muscle by 1.6- to 2.3-fold in response to freezing. GSTs responded strongly to freezing in turtle brain with amounts of GSTP1, M1, K1, and A3 elevated by 1.5- to 2.4-fold. GSTM3 and T1 rose by 1.8- to 2.3-fold in gut, whereas reduced levels of GSTP1, M1, M3, and K1 were found in livers of frozen animals. Levels of the AKR1B4 isozyme rose 2.1-fold during freezing in brain. CONCLUSIONS: Freezing triggered tissue-specific changes in the antioxidant defenses in C.pictamarginata organs. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that activation of an antioxidant response is an important aspect of natural freeze tolerance in turtles.},

abstract = {This article describes a retrospective study of patients who underwent posterior  indirect reduction procedures for thoracolumbar burst fractures. The goal of this study was to explore a simple and effective method for evaluating the reduction of spinal canal fragments during posterior indirect reduction procedures.Sixty-four burst fractures with retropulsed bone fragments encroaching the spinal canal at the thoracolumbar junction were performed. C-arm fluoroscopy was used to evaluate the spinal canal fragments' reduction. A standard lateral view of the thoracolumbar spine was set up. When a continuous and smooth posterior vertebral body line of the injured vertebrae appeared, similar to below and above the vertebrae, the spinal canal bone fragment was considered to be satisfactorily reduced. The midsagittal diameter of the injured segment was measured on preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Narrowing of the midsagittal diameter of the injured segment was improved from 41.4{\%}+/-15.9{\%} to 13.7{\%}+/-9.7{\%}. The correction value was 27.6{\%}+/-15.6{\%}. All pre- and postoperative outcome variables had statistical significance (P{\textless}.01). Forty-two patients experienced a restored posterior vertebral body line with a continuous and smooth vertical line, indicating that the fragment reduction was satisfactory. Post-operative CT showed that the spinal canal compromise was {\textless}10{\%} (range, 0{\%}-9.8{\%}; mean, 6.1{\%}+/-2.9{\%}).Continuous and smooth posterior vertebral body line imaging is a simple and effective method to judge the reduction of a bone fragment retropulsed into the spinal canal. It can provide evidence as to whether a laminotomy and pushing the bone fragment are necessary during posterior surgery.},

abstract = {The AO-Magerl classification is widely accepted for the appropriate management of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures; however, it fails to assess the ability of the injured spine to withstand compressive loading and cannot predict instrumentation failure after short-segment posterior fixation. The load-sharing classification depends on the degree of comminution and apposition of bony fragments.We retrospectively classified according to both classifications 100 consecutive patients with 1-level thoracolumbar burst fractures treated nonoperatively or operatively within a 7-year period. Sixty neurologically intact patients (60{\%}) were treated nonoperatively, 15 (15{\%}) had short posterior instrumentation, 15 (15{\%}) had short anterior instrumentation, and 10 (10{\%}) had combined short posterior instrumentation and anterior strut grafting. Twenty-five of the 40 (60{\%}) surgically treated patients had neurological impairment on admission. Clinical outcome was assessed using a pain and working ability scale. Mean follow-up was 52 months (range, 24-70 months). Function was satisfactory in 55 (92{\%}) nonoperatively treated patients and in 33 (83{\%}) surgically treated patients. Neurological improvement by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade was observed in patients with incomplete paraplegia (70{\%} of neurologically impaired patients) who were treated operatively.The combination of AO-Magerl and load-sharing classifications provides for accurate selection of treatment, surgical approach, and length of instrumentation, and can guide the decision for additional anterior surgery.},

METHODS: Thirty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation combined reduction of central end-plate by end-plate expand clamp and vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement. There were 22 males and 8 females with an average of 47 years (range from 25 to 71 years). Segment of fracture had 1 case in T11, 5 in T12, 14 in L1, 8 in L2, 2 in L3, 1 in L4, 1 in L5. According to Denis typing, 4 cases were type A, 25 type B, 1 type C, 1 type D, 1 type E. The relative anterior height of vertebral body and the vertebral angle were measured before and after operation and during the follow-up period (8 months after operation) through X-ray, the failure of internal fixation and recurrent kyphosis were evaluated during the follow-up period. Vertebral intracorporeal gap was measured by CT images after operation and the central end-plate fracture and reduction were observed by the reconstructed CT images (sagittal and coronary) before and after operation. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 8 to 15 months with an average of 12 months. Relative anterior height of vertebral body and vertebral angle were well restored after operation, and there was no significant change between after operation and 8 months after operation. Preoperative,postoperative and 8 months after operation, relative anterior height of vertebral body respectively was 40.1{\%}, 98.2{\%}, 97.8{\%}, vertebral angle respectively was 18.30, 2.70, 3.20. No failure of internal fixation and recurrent kyphosis were found during the follow-up period. The vertebral intracorporeal gap was about 3.1{\%} and reduction of central endplate fracture was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement can provide excellent reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height in the fracture level, prevent the failure of internal fixation which is an ideal method for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation without anterior column reconstruction is associated with a high rate of screw breakage and progressive loss of reduction. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the functional, neurologic, and radiographic results following transpedicular, balloon-assisted fracture reduction with anterior column reconstruction with use of calcium phosphate bone cement combined with short-segment posterior instrumentation and a laminectomy. METHODS: A consecutive series of thirty-eight patients with an unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture with or without neurologic deficit were managed with transpedicular, balloon-assisted fracture reduction, calcium phosphate bone cement reconstruction, and short-segment spinal instrumentation from 2002 to 2005. Twenty-eight of the thirty-eight patients were followed for a minimum of two years. Demographic data, neurologic function, segmental kyphosis, the fracture severity score, canal compromise, the Short Form-36 score, the Oswestry Disability Index score, and treatment-related complications were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: All thirteen patients with incomplete neurologic deficits had improvement by at least one Frankel grade. The mean kyphotic angulation improved from 17 degrees preoperatively to 7 degrees at the time of the latest follow-up, and the loss of vertebral body height improved from a mean of 42{\%} preoperatively to 14{\%} at the time of the latest follow-up. Screw breakage occurred in two patients, and pseudarthrosis occurred in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that excellent reduction of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures with and without associated neurologic deficits can be maintained with use of short-segment instrumentation and a transpedicular balloon-assisted reduction combined with anterior column reconstruction with calcium phosphate bone cement performed through a single posterior incision. The resultant circumferential stabilization combined with a decompressive laminectomy led to maintained or improved neurologic function in all patients with neurologic deficits, with a low rate of instrumentation failure and loss of correction.},

abstract = {The degree of automaticity of locomotion in primates compared with other mammals  remains unclear. Here, we examine the possibility for activation of the spinal locomotor circuitry in noninjured humans by spinal electromagnetic stimulation (SEMS). SEMS (3 Hz and 1.3-1.82 tesla) at the T11-T12 vertebrae induced involuntary bilateral locomotor-like movements in the legs of individuals placed in a gravity-neutral position. The formation of locomotor-like activity during SEMS started with a latency of 0.68 +/- 0.1 s after delivering the first stimulus, unlike continuous vibration of muscles, which requires several seconds. The first EMG burst in response to SEMS was observed most often in a proximal flexor muscle. We speculate that SEMS directly activates the circuitry intrinsic to the spinal cord, as suggested by the immediate response and the electrophysiological observations demonstrating an absence of strictly time-linked responses within the EMG burst associated with individual stimuli during SEMS. SEMS in the presence of vibration of the leg muscles was more effective in facilitating locomotor-like activity than SEMS alone. The present results suggest that SEMS could be an effective noninvasive clinical tool to determine the potential of an individual to recover locomotion after a spinal cord injury, as well as being an effective rehabilitation tool itself.},

abstract = {Patients with fractures from the 11th thoracic to the 5th lumbar vertebra had a reconstruction of the anterior column with monocortical iliac crest autograft by using a single dorsal approach. The loss of correction was observed using X-rays pre- and post-operatively, at 3 months and after implant removal (IR). Successful fusion was assessed using computed tomography after the implant removal. To assess the loss of correction and intervertebral fusion rate of this technique. There are still controversial discussions about the treatment modalities of spine lesions, especially in cases of burst fractures. Dorsal, combined and ventral procedures are reported with different assets and drawbacks. We want to present a method to restore the weight-bearing capability of the anterior column using a single dorsal approach. From 2001 to 2005, a total of 100 patients was treated with this technique at our department. Follow-up examination was possible in 82 patients. The X-rays and CT scans were proofed for loss of correction and fusion rate. The anterior column has been restored using a monocortical strut graft via a partial resection of the lamina and the apophyseal joint on one side to access the disc space. The dorsal reduction has been achieved using an angular stable pedicle screw system. The mean follow-up time was 15 months (range 8-39); 67 patients had a CT scan at follow-up and 83{\%} showed a 360 degrees fusion. The average post-operative loss of correction was 3.3 degrees (range 0-21). The average duration of operation was 192 min (range 120-360) and the mean blood loss was 790 ml (range 300-3,400 ml). Regarding the complications we did not have any deep wound infections. We had two epidural haematomas postoperatively with a neurological deterioration that had to be revised. We were able to decompress the neurological structures and restore the weight-bearing capability of the anterior column in a one-stage procedure. So we think that this technique can be an alternative procedure to combined operations regarding the presented radiological results of successful fusion and loss of correction.},

METHODS: From June 2005 to June 2008, 27 patients of early single thoracolumbar fracture were treated using short or long segments pedicle screw instrumentation, fracture vertebral (AO classification: type A1 or A2) was between T11 or L2. All patients were divided into A or B group according to age. A group: 12 cases mean age (32.6+/-10.7) years old (range, 16-55 years old). B group: 15 cases mean age (66.8+/-9.2) years old (range, 56-78 years old). All patients were treated with bony autograft by transpedicular of fracture vertebral and internal fixation by pedicle instrumentation. Pedicle screws were inserted in the pedicles of above and lower adjacent vertebral body of fracture vertebral, and others were inserted in the pedicles of above and lower two vertebral bodies of injured vertebral. Recorded operation time, blood loss and occurrence of complications. All patients took X radiograph plane examination (anterior-posterior position and lateral position) before operation and during 1 week of post operation and more than 1 year of follow up. Measured percentage of anterior compression vertebral high and kyphosis angle of the fracture vertebral by the same one group doctors. RESULTS: Mean follow up time was (29.6+/-9.1) months (range, 10 - 34 months).

There was no statistic different significantly between A and B group. The patients using short segments fixation, preoperative, during one week of post operation, one year of follow up, in A group the percentage of anterior compression vertebral high were 41.3+/-14.0, 5.4+/-1.0, 13.6+/-1.1, and 38.5+/-11.2, 8.3+/-2.1, 21.4+/-5.2 in B group. The patients using long segments fixation, at some time of preoperative, during one week of post operation and one year of follow up the percentage of anterior compression vertebral high were 40.8+/-11.5, 4.6+/-1.2, 8.3+/-1.0 in group A, and 44.3+/-10.2, 9.7+/-2.1, 11.2+/-3.0 in group B. In group A and B the kyphosis angle of fracture segment was 17.5 degrees+/-1.0 degrees and 16.3 degrees+/-3.1 degrees before operation, 4.2 degrees+/-1.0 degrees and 6.0 degrees+/-1.1 degrees in one week of postoperation and 11.5 degrees+/-1.0 degrees, 13.4 degrees+/-3.0 degrees in one year later postoperation. All the compression vertebral high was recovered and kyphosis was corrected significantly during one week and one year after operation (P{\textless}0.05), but there was some loss of kyphosis correction rate in follow up. CONCLUSION: There is better clinical efficacy of short segments pedicle instrumentation for treating early thoracolumbar fracture in the young group, but long segments fixation of pedicle instrumentation is more suitable for the older group.},

abstract = {This study explored the feasibility and clinical outcome of kyphoplasty for the treatment of painful osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. A total of 25 consecutive patients with painful type-A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures without neurological deficit were treated by kyphoplasty. Pain was measured using the self-reporting visual analog pain scale (VAS) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. Disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. The height of the fractured vertebral body, kyphotic angle, and spinal canal compromise were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. Relief of pain was achieved 24 hours postoperatively. Mean VAS score decreased from 8.2+/-1.3 preoperatively to 2.8+/-0.8 postoperatively (P{\textless}.05), and was maintained at 2.9+/-1.1 at 6-month follow-up. The ODI score varied from 68.2{\%}+/-6.6{\%} preoperatively to 35.3{\%}+/-2.8{\%} postoperatively (P{\textless}.05). Improvement was maintained at 6-month follow-up. Postoperatively, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha) was restored from 61.5{\%}+/-13.9{\%} to 85.3{\%}+/-10.6{\%}, the height of midline vertebrae (Hm) restored from 73.0{\%}+/-19.3{\%} to 83.3{\%}+/-7.4{\%}, the kyphotic angle from 21.7 degrees +/-7.8 degrees to 8.6 degrees +/-6.6 degrees, and the spinal canal compromise from 20.1{\%}+/-4.1{\%} to 17.8{\%}+/-1.3{\%}. At 6-month follow-up, maintenance of the height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction was found. No significant difference was noted in pre- and postoperative spinal canal compromise. Kyphoplasty is a relatively safe and effective method for the treatment of painful osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

Thirty of them were managed with long-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation and twenty patients with short-segment stabilization. The mean follow up period was 5.2 years. Pre-operative and post-operative radiological parameters, like the Cobb angle, the kyphotic deformation and the Beck index were evaluated. A statistically significant difference between the two under study groups was noted for the Cobb angle and the kyphotic deformation, while, as far as the Beck index is concerned, no significant difference was noted. In conclusion, either the long-segment or the short-segment stabilization is able for reducing the segmental kyphosis and the vertebral body deformation postoperatively. However, as time goes by, the long-segment stabilization is associated with better results as far as the radiological parameters, the indexes and the patient's satisfaction are concerned.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to investigate whether transpedicular bone grafting as a supplement to posterior pedicle screw fixation in thoracolumbar fractures results in a stable reconstruction of the anterior column, that allows healing of the fracture without loss of correction. Posterior instrumentation using an internal fixator is a standard procedure for stabilizing the injured thoracolumbar spine. Transpedicular bone grafting was first described by Daniaux in 1986 to achieve intrabody fusion. Pedicle screw fixation with additional transpedicular fusion has remained controversial because of inconsistent reports. A retrospective single surgeon cohort study was performed. Between October 2001 and May 2007, 30 consecutive patients with 31 acute traumatic burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (D12-L5) were treated operatively. The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years (range: 19-78). There were 23 men and 7 women. Nineteen thoracolumbar fractures were sustained in falls from a height; the other fractures were the result of motor vehicle accidents. The vertebrae most often involved were L1 in 13 patients and L2 in 8 patients. According to the Magerl classification, 25 patients sustained Type A1, 4 Type A2 and 2 Type A3 fractures. The mean time from injury to surgery was 6 days (range 2-14 days). Two postoperative complications were observed: one superficial and one deep infection. Mean Cobb's angle improved from +7.16 degrees (SD 12.44) preoperatively to -5.48 degrees (SD 11.44) immediately after operation, with a mean loss of correction of 1.00 degrees (SD 3.04) at two years. Reconstruction of the anterior column is important to prevent loss of correction. In our experience, the use of transpedicular bone grafting has efficiently restored the anterior column and has preserved the post-operative correction of kyphosis until healing of the fracture.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: We assessed risk factors for lumbosacral plexus palsy related to pelvic fracture that can be evaluated during the acute injury phase with diagnostics such as computed tomography (CT). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many patients with pelvic fracture are in vital shock, with polytrauma and loss of consciousness, making an accurate neurologic examination very difficult in the emergency room. METHODS: This study included 22 patients who had AO classification type B or C pelvic fractures. The 22 patients had 27 posterior osteoligamentary lesions. The average injury severity score (ISS) was 27.5 (range, 16-50). Age, sex, ISS, suicidal jump, longitudinal displacement, sacral transverse fracture, pubic fracture, lumbar transverse process fracture, type of pelvic fracture (AO), and type of sacral fracture (Denis) were examined for a correlation with the lumbosacral plexus palsy. Using coronal reconstruction CT, we considered a 10 mm or greater displacement at the sacrum or sacroiliac joint to be a longitudinal displacement. Transverse sacral fracture was diagnosed by sagittal reconstruction CT. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, 5 (22.7{\%}) had lumbosacral plexus palsy (8 of 27 pelvic fractures) detected during treatment. The incidence of lumbosacral plexus palsy was not related to age, sex, ISS. Incidence of palsy was significantly higher when the patient's affected side had longitudinal displacement. Patients who had made a suicidal jump or had a sacral transverse fracture also had a significantly higher risk for lumbosacral plexus palsy. Palsy was not related to the type of pelvic fracture (AO) or sacral fracture (Denis). CONCLUSION: In this study, longitudinal displacement of the pelvis, transverse sacral fracture, and trauma from a suicidal jump were risk factors for lumbosacral plexus palsy. These risk factors were helpful in our examination of patients who had severe pelvic fracture with loss of consciousness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a spreading epidural hematoma (SEH) and deep subcutaneous edema (DSE) as indirect signs of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries on MR imaging of thoracolumbar burst fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed spinal MR images of 43 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures: 17 patients with PLC injuries (study group) and 26 without PLC injuries (control group). An SEH was defined as a hemorrhagic infiltration into the anterior or posterior epidural space that spread along more than three vertebrae including the level of the fracture. A DSE was regarded as a fluid-like signal lesion in the deep subcutaneous layer of the back, and its epicenter was at the burst fracture level. The frequency of the SEH/DSE in the two groups was analyzed. In addition, the association between each sign and the degree of vertebral collapse, the severity of central canal compromise, and surgical decisions were analyzed. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images showed an SEH in 20 out of 43 patients (46{\%}) and a DSE in 17 (40{\%}). The SEH and DSE were more commonly seen in the study group with PLC injuries (SEH, 15 out of 17 patients, 80{\%}; DSE, 16 out of 17 patients, 94{\%}) than in the control group without PLC injuries (SEH, 5 out of 26, 19{\%}; DSE, 1 out of 26, 4{\%}) (P {\textless}0.0001). The SEH and DSE were significantly associated with surgical management decisions (17 out of 20 patients with SEH, 85{\%}, vs 8 out of the 23 without SEH, 35{\%}, P =0.002; 15 out of 17 with DSE, 88{\%}, vs 10 out of 26 without DSE, 38{\%}, P =0.002). The SEH and DSE did not correlate with the degree of vertebral collapse or the severity of central canal compromise. CONCLUSION: The SEH and DSE may be useful secondary MR signs of posterior ligamentous complex injury in thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Multinational survey of spine trauma surgeons. OBJECTIVES: To survey a multinational group of spine trauma surgeons and develop an updated consensus definition of posttraumatic kyphosis (PTK), and the most current methods for diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PTK remains a potential problematic sequela of thoracolumbar trauma. Although most surgeons have devised their own approaches for detecting and treating this condition, broad agreement in terms of the diagnosis and management of PTK has not been achieved. There is a lack of consensus-based guidelines, as the current literature largely consists of small case series or anecdotal expert opinions. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was circulated among 35 multinational spine trauma surgeons. The questionnaire consisted of 29 questions divided into 8 domains: definition, diagnosis, risk factors, symptoms, radiographic evaluation, surgical indications, treatment, and expected outcome. Answers from respondents were compiled and evaluated to generate a consensus. RESULTS: All 35 surgeons completed the survey. Consensus was achieved that PTK represents "a painful kyphotic angulation that can occur anywhere in the posttraumatic spine." Agreement was also reached that asymptomatic PTK can exist, although no true consensus could be reached on the extent of angular deformity that results in PTK. Untreated or maltreated flexion-distraction injuries, or severe burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine, were felt to be the 2 injuries most likely to produce PTK. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and dynamic radiographs were all recommended for evaluation. If surgery is necessary, posteriorly based osteotomies, especially pedicle subtraction osteotomies, have become the principal means of correction. CONCLUSIONS: An updated understanding of PTK and its treatment has been achieved. Posterior osteotomies seem to be the most popular means of surgical correction. In the future, multicenter prospective studies are necessary to ascertain, with greater precision, the most appropriate treatment for this condition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fractures are rare in the pediatric population. There is limited information available on the best treatment for these injuries. The aims of our study were to evaluate the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI) and the potential for neurologic recovery associated with pediatric burst fractures; to compare sagittal alignment between nonoperative and operative treatment; and to determine whether functional outcomes are improved after surgery. METHODS: All pediatric patients who sustained thoracic or lumbar burst fractures at 2 institutions between 1991 and 2005 were identified. The medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, injury, treatment, and outcomes. Health Survey data were collected from a subset of patients in both the operative and nonoperative groups. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 17 male patients and 20 female patients, with an average age of 14.6 years (range, 6 to 18 y). Nine patients were treated nonoperatively and 28 patients were treated operatively. The nonoperative group was treated with hyperextension casting or bracing and showed progression of kyphotic deformity from 16.1 degrees at injury to 23.1 degrees at final follow-up. In patients treated operatively, the kyphotic deformity improved from 17.1 degrees at presentation to 7.2 degrees at final follow-up. Twenty-four patients were neurologically intact at presentation, whereas 13 presented with neurologic deficit. Six of 13 patients with SCI had some improvement. The risk of SCI was highest in patients with thoracic-level fractures. The risk of SCI did not correlate with canal compromise. There were no significant differences in functional outcome between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of neurologic injury in pediatric burst fractures of the spine may be more closely related to the level of injury (thoracic) than the degree of spinal canal compromise. Prognosis for recovery of neurologic injury is related to the severity of the initial neurologic injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic level 2.},

METHODS: From March 2008 to March 2013, 62 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with short-segment posterior pedicle screw combined with transpedicle vertebral bone grafting. Including 40 males and 22 females, the age from 17 to 65 years old with an average of 38 years. According to AO classification, 34 cases were type A3.1, 7 cases were type A3.2 and 21 cases were type A3.3. Load-sharing scores were from 4 to 6 points with an average of 5.4 points. According to ASIA grade, 2 cases were grade C, 5 cases were grade D and 55 cases were grade E. Preoperative, postoperative at 3 d and final follow-up, the Cobb angle, the relative height of anterior vertebral body and the encroachment rate of spinal canal were measured by X-ray films and computed tomography (CT) scan, meanwhile, the information of bone healing and spinal nerves recovery were observed. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 11 to 14 months with an average of 12.2 months. The duration of removing internal fixation were from 9 to 13 months (averaged, 11.5 months). One suffered from infection and was cured by debridement. Two cases had mild pain of back. At 6 months after operation, according to ASIA grade to evaluate never function, 1 case was grade C, 3 cases were grade D and 58 cases were grade E. X-ray and CT showed the fractures obtained good union at final follow-up. The Cobb angle, the relative height of anterior vertebral body and the encroachment rate of spinal canal had obviously improved at 3 days after operation (P{\textless}0.05); but there was no significant differences between postoperative at 3 d and final follow-up (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSION: Short-segment posterior pedicle screw combined with transpedicle vertebral bone grafting is an effective method to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures. It can reduce the loss of postoperative correction and prevent the internal fixation failure.},

In the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, long segment (LS) posterior instrumentation two levels above and below the fracture level has been used. In our study, burst fractures were produced at L1 in eight fresh frozen human cadaveric spines. The spines were then tested in three conditions: 1) intact, 2) after LS (T11-L3), 3) SS (T12-L2) instrumentation with pedicle screws and rods, and 4) short segment instrumentation plus cement augmentation of the fracture level (SSC). LS instrumentation was found to significantly reduce the motion at the instrumented level (T12-L2) as well as the levels immediately adjacent in flexion, extension and lateral bending. Similarly, SSC augmentation was found to significantly reduce the motion compared to intact at T12-L2 but still maintained the adjacent level motion. However, SS instrumentation alone did not significantly reduce the motion at T12-L2 except for left lateral bending. While LS instrumentation remains the most stable construct, SS instrumentation augmented with vertebroplasty at the fracture level increases rigidity in flexion, extension and right lateral bending beyond SS instrumentation alone.},

The purpose of this report is to present a rare case of posttraumatic kyphosis due to a L1 burst fracture in a patient with OI, and to discuss how to treat it to achieve an adequate correction and circumferential fusion. The patient was a 29-year-old man with OI (Sillence type-IA) who had sustained an L1 fracture when he dived head first into a river. After 3 months of conservative therapy with a body cast, he showed disability at work because of his persistent low back pain and fatigue in his whole back. He showed no neurological disorder. Diagnostic imaging revealed localized kyphotic deformity at L1. Therefore, lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis worsened. Anterior release and fusion, and posterior fusion were conducted. Three months after surgical treatment, circumferential fusion was obtained. His low back pain and fatigue in the whole back disappeared, and he could resume work without any difficulty. From the bone union standpoint, the surgical strategy for spinal correction in OI patients is still controversial because of the intractableness of bone union and fragility of the bone itself. The authors achieved circumferential union using anterior fusion and posterior fusion, in which wide bone bed is available owing to spared posterior elements of the spinal column.},

abstract = {The resolution of inflammation is an integral and natural part of the physiological response to tissue injury, infection and allergens or other noxious stimuli. Resolution is now recognised as an active process with highly regulated cellular and biochemical events. Recent discoveries have highlighted that innate inflammatory cells have bimodal effector functions during the inflammatory response, including active roles during the resolution process. Several mediators displaying potent pro-resolving actions have recently been uncovered. Lipoxin A4, the lead member of this new class of pro-resolving mediators, has anti-inflammatory actions on type 2 innate lymphoid cells and pro-resolving actions through natural killer cells in asthma immunobiology. Eosinophils are also able to control crucial aspects of resolution through the generation of pro-resolving mediators. Uncontrolled asthma has been associated with a defect in the generation of specialised pro-resolving mediators, including lipoxin A4 and protectin D1. Thus, bioactive stable analogue mimetics of these mediators that can harness endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation may offer new therapeutic strategies for asthma and airway inflammation associated diseases.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This project describes a morphology-based subaxial cervical spine traumatic injury classification system. Using the same approach as the thoracolumbar system, the goal was to develop a comprehensive yet simple classification system with high intra- and interobserver reliability to be used for clinical and research purposes. METHODS: A subaxial cervical spine injury classification system was developed using a consensus process among clinical experts. All investigators were required to successfully grade 10 cases to demonstrate comprehension of the system before grading 30 additional cases on two occasions, 1 month apart. Kappa coefficients (kappa) were calculated for intraobserver and interobserver reliability. RESULTS: The classification system is based on three injury morphology types similar to the TL system: compression injuries (A), tension band injuries (B), and translational injuries (C), with additional descriptions for facet injuries, as well as patient-specific modifiers and neurologic status. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was substantial for all injury subtypes (kappa = 0.75 and 0.64, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The AOSpine subaxial cervical spine injury classification system demonstrated substantial reliability in this initial assessment, and could be a valuable tool for communication, patient care and for research purposes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unlike the cervical spine (C-spine), where National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and the Canadian C-spine Rules can be used, evidence-based thoracolumbar spine (TL-spine) clearance guidelines do not exist. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical decision rule for evaluating the TL-spine after injury. METHODS: Adult ({\textgreater}/=15 years) blunt trauma patients were prospectively enrolled at 13 US trauma centers (January 2012 to January 2014). Exclusion criteria included the following: C-spine injury with neurologic deficit, preexisting paraplegia/tetraplegia, and unevaluable examination. Remaining evaluable patients underwent TL-spine imaging and were followed up to discharge. The primary end point was a clinically significant TL-spine injury requiring TL-spine orthoses or surgical stabilization. Regression techniques were used to develop a clinical decision rule. Decision rule performance in identifying clinically significant fractures was tested. RESULTS: Of 12,479 patients screened, 3,065 (24.6{\%}) met inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 43.5 [19.8] years [range, 15-103 years]; male sex, 66.3{\%}; mean [SD] Injury Severity Score [ISS], 8.8 [7.5]). The majority underwent computed tomography (93.3{\%}), 6.3{\%} only plain films, and 0.2{\%} magnetic resonance imaging exclusively. TL-spine injury was identified in 499 patients (16.3{\%}), of which 264 (8.6{\%}) were clinically significant (29.2{\%} surgery, 70.8{\%} TL-spine orthosis). The majority was AO Type A1 282 (56.5{\%}), followed by 67 (13.4{\%}) A3, 43 (8.6{\%}) B2, and 32 (6.4{\%}) A4 injuries. The predictive ability of clinical examination (pain, midline tenderness, deformity, neurologic deficit), age, and mechanism was examined; positive clinical examination finding resulted in a sensitivity of 78.4{\%} and a specificity of 72.9{\%}. Addition of age of 60 years or older and high-risk mechanism (fall, crush, motor vehicle crash with ejection/rollover, unenclosed vehicle crash, auto vs. pedestrian) increased sensitivity to 98.9{\%} with specificity of 29.0{\%} for clinically significant injuries and 100.0{\%} sensitivity and 27.3{\%} specificity for injuries requiring surgery. CONCLUSION: Clinical examination alone is insufficient for determining the need for imaging in evaluable patients at risk of TL-spine injury. Addition of age and high-risk mechanism results in a clinical decision-making rule with a sensitivity of 98.9{\%} for clinically significant injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic test, level III.},

abstract = {Purpose. In cases of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures, percutaneous vertebral augmentation can be used in addition to posterior stabilisation. The use of an augmentation technique with a bone-filled polyethylene mesh as a stand-alone treatment for traumatic vertebral fractures has not yet been investigated. Methods. In this retrospective study, 17 patients with acute type A3.1 fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine underwent stand-alone augmentation with mesh and allograft bone and were followed up for one year using pain scales and sagittal endplate angles. Results. From before surgery to 12 months after surgery, pain and physical function improved significantly, as indicated by an improvement in the median VAS score and in the median pain and work scale scores. From before to immediately after surgery, all patients showed a significant improvement in mean mono- and bisegmental kyphoses. During the one-year period, there was a significant loss of correction. Conclusions. Based on this data a stand-alone approach with vertebral augmentation with polyethylene mesh and allograft bone is not a suitable therapy option for incomplete burst fractures for a young patient collective.},

A burst fracture of L1 associated with a vertebral hemangioma was identified with an L3 compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis. The local kyphosis angle between T12 and L2 was 27 degrees . Kyphotic deformity was corrected and postoperatively, the measured T12-L2 local kyphotic angle was 9 degrees . Twelve hours postoperatively, oral nutrition was allowed, but she developed nausea and vomiting and twenty-four hours postoperatively, an electrolyte imbalance developed. Postoperatively, the patient was diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of superior mesenteric artery syndrome, which occurred following the correction of a kyphotic deformity that had developed secondary to an advanced hemangioma in pregnancy.},

Nineteen patients younger than 40 years old with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were included. The surgical procedure included postural reduction for 3 days and screw fixations at one level above, one level below and at the fractured level itself. The implants were removed 12 months after initial operation. Imaging and clinical findings were analyzed at preoperative, 12 months after surgery, just before implant removal, and at six months after implant removal. Results indicated that difference was statistically significant between preoperative period or postoperative 1 year follow-up, just before implant removal and 6 months after implant removal (P {\textless} 0.05). Results at postoperative 1 year follow-up, just before implant removal and 6 months after implant removal were better than preoperative period. There were no significant complications or neurological deterioration after screws insert and removal in any patient. The rate of clinical outcome with excellent and good was 94.7{\%}. In conclusion, short segment pedicle screw fixation without bone fusion can be an effective and safe operative srategytechnique in the management of young patients suffering from unstable burst fracture.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical results of a partial vertebrectomy with titanium mesh implantation and pedicle screw fixation using a posterior approach to reconstruct the spine in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHOD: From January 2006 to August 2008, 20 patients with severe thoracolumbar fractures were treated.For vertebral bodies associated with one injured intervertebral disk, subtotal vertebrectomy surgery and single-segment fusion were performed. For vertebral bodies with two injured adjacent intervertebral disks, partial vertebrectomy surgery and two-segment fusion were performed. RESULTS: All 20 patients were followed up for 12 to 24 months (average of 18 months). There were no complications such as wound infections, hemopneumothorax or abdominal infections in any of the patients. The neurological status of all of the patients was improved by at least one American Spinal Injury Association grade by the last follow-up. The anterior vertebral body height was an average of 50.77{\%} before surgery, 88.51{\%} after surgery and 87.86{\%} at the last follow up; the sagittal Cobb angle was improved, on average, from 26.15 degrees to 5.39 degrees and was 5.90 degrees at the last follow up. The percentage of spinal stenosis was improved, on average, from 26.07{\%} to 4.93{\%} degrees and was 6.15{\%} at the last follow up. There were significant differences in the anterior vertebral body height pre- and post-surgery and in the sagittal Cobb angle and the percentage of spinal stenosis (p{\textless}0) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: This surgical procedure is simple and can accomplish decompression, reduction, fixation and fusion of the spine in one stage. This approach could be widely used in orthopedics.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 238 patients who underwent anterolateral decompression and instrumentation for single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures from January 2010 and March 2012. The influences of several potential risk factors that might affect supplementary posterior instrumentation were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients who developed worsening back pain without neurological deterioration after the anterolateral approach treatment need further posterior instrumentation fixation. The univariate analysis showed that age, disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament complex (PLC), and fracture level were the risk factors for supplementary posterior instrumentation. However, age and integrity of the PLC were the independent risk factors for supplementary posterior instrumentation by multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental posterior instrumentation was necessary in 11.3{\%} of cases following anterolateral decompression and instrumentation in the present study. Older age and disruption of the PLC were the independent risk factors in prediction of supplementary posterior instrumentation in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

METHODS: A previously described classification system of thoracolumbar injuries which consists of a morphologic classification of the fracture, a grading system for the neurologic status and relevant patient-specific modifiers was applied to 25 cases by 100 spinal surgeons from across the world twice independently, in grading sessions 1 month apart. The results were analyzed for classification reliability using the Kappa coefficient (kappa). RESULTS: The overall Kappa coefficient for all cases was 0.56, which represents moderate reliability. Kappa values describing interobserver agreement were 0.80 for type A injuries, 0.68 for type B injuries and 0.72 for type C injuries, all representing substantial reliability. The lowest level of agreement for specific subtypes was for fracture subtype A4 (Kappa = 0.19). Intraobserver analysis demonstrated overall average Kappa statistic for subtype grading of 0.68 also representing substantial reproducibility. CONCLUSION: In a worldwide sample of spinal surgeons without previous exposure to the recently described AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System, we demonstrated moderate interobserver and substantial intraobserver reliability. These results suggest that most spine surgeons can reliably apply this system to spine trauma patients as or more reliably than previously described systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries to the thoracolumbar spine result in a high incidence of unstable fractures. The goal of the surgical management is to achieve an adequate decompression and stabilization. We have analyzed operative and postoperative features of anterior surgical approaches. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 45 patients that presented with traumatic unstable thoracolumbar fractures who underwent anterior corpectomy with stabilization from January 1999 to January 2009. The neurological status of the patient was defined using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 37.6 years (range: 13-70), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1. Retroperitoneal approach was used in 64.4{\%}, transthoracic in 13.3{\%}, and transthoracic transdiaghragmatic in 22.2{\%}. The average operation time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and length of stay after surgery was 412.3 min, 1098 ml and 9.1 days, respectively. A BMI{\textgreater}25 was associated with longer operative times (p{\textless}0.02) and higher EBL (p{\textless}0.006). Perioperative complications occurred in 37.7{\%}, (7 major, 10 minor). The mean sagittal angulation improved from 15.5 degree preoperatively to 8.7 degree postoperatively (p{\textless}0.001). Postoperative neurological status remained intact in all patients having preoperative ASIA-E status (n=18), improved in 7 of 14 patients with ASIA-D, and improved in 1 of 5 patients with ASIA-B preoperative neurological deficit. There were no cases of neurological deterioration postoperatively, and majority of the patient (84.4{\%}) of the patients were discharged home. At latest follow-up (mean 27.2 months) there were no new cases of neurological deficits, and 9 patients had a further improvement of neurological status. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, anterior surgical approach appears to be a safe and effective technique for managing traumatic thoracic and lumbar unstable burst fractures. This is also evident that anterior decompression and stabilization achieves a significant correction of kyphotic deformity with a lower risk of neurological deterioration and pseudoarthrosis.},

abstract = {Thoracolumbar spine fractures are common injuries that can result in significant  disability, deformity and neurological deficit. Controversies exist regarding the appropriate radiological investigations, the indications for surgical management and the timing, approach and type of surgery. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, biomechanical principles, radiological and clinical evaluation, classification and management principles. Literature review of all relevant articles published in PubMed covering thoracolumbar spine fractures with or without neurologic deficit was performed. The search terms used were thoracolumbar, thoracic, lumbar, fracture, trauma and management. All relevant articles and abstracts covering thoracolumbar spine fractures with and without neurologic deficit were reviewed. Biomechanically the thoracolumbar spine is predisposed to a higher incidence of spinal injuries. Computed tomography provides adequate bony detail for assessing spinal stability while magnetic resonance imaging shows injuries to soft tissues (posterior ligamentous complex [PLC]) and neurological structures. Different classification systems exist and the most recent is the AO spine knowledge forum classification of thoracolumbar trauma. Treatment includes both nonoperative and operative methods and selected based on the degree of bony injury, neurological involvement, presence of associated injuries and the integrity of the PLC. Significant advances in imaging have helped in the better understanding of thoracolumbar fractures, including information on canal morphology and injury to soft tissue structures. The ideal classification that is simple, comprehensive and guides management is still elusive. Involvement of three columns, progressive neurological deficit, significant kyphosis and canal compromise with neurological deficit are accepted indications for surgical stabilization through anterior, posterior or combined approaches.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of posterior laminotomy decompression and bone grafting via the injured vertebrae for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Between November 2010 and November 2012, 58 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated by posterior fixation combined with posterior laminotomy decompression and intervertebral bone graft in the injured vertebrae. There were 40 males and 18 females with a mean age of 48 years (range, 25-58 years). According to Denis classification, 58 cases had burst fractures (Denis type B); based on neurological classification of spinal cord injury by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classifications, 5 cases were rated as grade A, 18 cases as grade B, 20 cases as grade C, 14 cases as grade D, and 1 case as grade E. Based on thoracolumbar burst fractures CT classifications there were 5 cases of type A, 20 cases of type B1, 10 cases of type B2, and 23 cases of type C. The time between injury and operation was 10 hours to 9 days (mean, 7.2 days). The CT was taken to measure the space occupying of vertebral canal. The X-ray film was taken to measure the relative height of fractured vertebrae for evaluating the vertebral height restoration, Cobb angle for evaluating the correction of kyphosis, and ASIA classification was conducted to evaluate the function recovery of the spinal cord. RESULTS: The operations were performed successfully, and incisions healed primarily. All the patients were followed up 12-18 months (mean, 15 months). CT showed good bone graft healing except partial absorption of vertebral body grafted bone; no loosening or breakage of screws and rods occurred. The stenosis rates of fractured vertebral canale were 47.56{\%} +/- 14.61{\%} at preoperation and 1.26{\%} +/- 0.62{\%} at 1 year after operation, showing significant difference (t = 24.46, P = 0.00). The Cobb angles were (16.98 +/- 3.67) degrees at preoperation, (3.42 +/- 1.45) degrees at 1 week after operation, (3.82 +/- 1.60) degrees at 1 year after operation, and (4.84 +/- 1.70) degrees at 3 months after removal of internal fixation, showing significant differences between at pre- and post-operation (P {\textless} 0.05). The relative heights of fractured vertebrae were 57.10{\%} +/- 6.52{\%} at preoperation, 96.26{\%} +/- 1.94{\%} at 1 week after operation, 96.11{\%} +/- 1.97{\%} at 1 year after operation, and 96.03{\%} +/- 1.96{\%} at 3 months after removal of internal fixation, showing significant differences between at pre- and post-operation (P {\textless} 0.05). At 1 year after operation, the neural function was improved 1-3 grades in 56 cases. Based on ASIA classifications, 1 case was rated as grade A, 4 cases as grade B, 10 cases as grade C, 23 cases as grade D, and 20 cases as grade E. CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae burst fractures by posterior laminotomy decompression and bone grafting via the injured vertebrae has satisfactory effectiveness, which can reconstruct vertebral body shape and height with spinal cord decompression and good vertebral healing. It is a kind of effective solution for thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In France, attempts to define common ground during spine surgery meetings have revealed significant variability in clinical practices across different schools of surgery and the two specialities involved in spine surgery, namely, neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery. OBJECTIVES: To objectively characterise this variability by performing a survey based on a fictitious spine trauma case. Our working hypothesis was that significant variability existed in trauma practices and that this variability was related to a lack of strong scientific evidence in spine trauma care. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey based on a clinical vignette describing a 31-year-old male with an L1 burst fracture and neurologic symptoms (numbness). Surgeons received the vignette and a 14-item questionnaire on the management of this patient. For each question, surgeons had to choose among five possible answers. Differences in answers across surgeons were assessed using the Index of Qualitative Variability (IQV), in which 0 indicates no variability and 1 maximal variability. Surgeons also received a questionnaire about their demographics and surgical experience. RESULTS: Of 405 invited spine surgeons, 200 responded to the survey. Five questions had an IQV greater than 0.9, seven an IQV between 0.5 and 0.9, and two an IQV lower than 0.5. Variability was greatest about the need for MRI (IQV=0.93), degree of urgency (IQV=0.93), need for fusion (IQV=0.92), need for post-operative bracing (IQV=0.91), and routine removal of instrumentation (IQV=0.94). Variability was lowest for questions about the need for surgery (IQV=0.42) and use of the posterior approach (IQV=0.36). Answers were influenced by surgeon specialty, age, experience level, and type of centre. CONCLUSION: Clinical practice regarding spine trauma varies widely in France. Little published evidence is available on which to base recommendations that would diminish this variability.},

To reveal spinal locomotor control principles, we studied the repertoire of rhythmic patterns that can be generated by the functionally isolated human lumbar spinal cord, detected as electromyographic activity from the legs, and investigated basic temporal components shared across these patterns. Ten subjects with chronic, motor-complete spinal cord injury were studied. Surface electromyographic responses to lumbar spinal cord stimulation were collected from quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and triceps surae in the supine position. From these data, 10-s segments of rhythmic activity present in the four muscle groups of one limb were extracted. Such samples were found in seven subjects. Physiologically adequate cycle durations and relative extension- and flexion-phase durations similar to those needed for locomotion were generated. The multi-muscle activation patterns exhibited a variety of coactivation, mixed-synergy and locomotor-like configurations. Statistical decomposition of the electromyographic data across subjects, muscles and samples of rhythmic patterns identified three common temporal components, i.e. basic or shared activation patterns. Two of these basic patterns controlled muscles to contract either synchronously or alternatingly during extension- and flexion-like phases. The third basic pattern contributed to the observed muscle activities independently from these extensor- and flexor-related basic patterns. Each bifunctional muscle group was able to express both extensor- and flexor-patterns, with variable ratios across the samples of rhythmic patterns. The basic activation patterns can be interpreted as central drives implemented by spinal burst generators that impose specific spatiotemporally organized activation on the lumbosacral motor neuron pools. Our data thus imply that the human lumbar spinal cord circuits can form burst-generating elements that flexibly combine to obtain a wide range of locomotor outputs from a constant, repetitive input. It may be possible to use this flexibility to incorporate specific adaptations to gait and stance to improve locomotor control, even after severe central nervous system damage.},

After the primary survey, with the thoracic trauma stabilized, neurovascular lesions excluded, and provisional immobilization applied, both fractures were classified as OTA: 33-A3, Rorabeck Type II, and closed reduction and internal fixation with distal femoral nails were performed. At 5 months of follow-up, the patient was able to walk with crutches and clear radiologic signs of fracture consolidation could be seen. At 24 months, the patient walked without any walking aid and had recovered her previous functional status. This surgical option allowed the authors to achieve relative stability using an intramedullary technique, preserving fracture hematoma in an osteopenic patient, and was found to be successful in recovering the patient's previous functional status and satisfaction after major trauma.},

METHODS: Clinical and radiographic results of posterior corpectomy, decompression and reconstruction (group A) and combined anterior-posterior surgery (group B) in the treatment of severe thoracolumbar three column fractures with incomplete paraplegia were analyzed retrospectively from January 2008 to December 2012. In group A, there were 18 patients (10 males and 8 females). The fractures were located on T11 in 1 case, T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 6 cases and L2 in 6 cases. In group B, there were 15 patients (9 males and 6 females). The fractures were located on T1 in 1 case, T12 in 5 cases, L1 in 5 cases and L2 in 4 cases. Neurological status was judged by Frankel grades. The X-ray and CT were used for evaluation of the restoration of anterior height of the fractured vertebral body, the correction of Cobbs angle, the decompression scope of spinal canal and the fusion. Complications related to operation were also considered. Results: The followup periods ranged from 12 to 18 months (averaged 16 months). The mean operation time, perioperative bleeding, postoperative drainage were (200 +/- 43) min, (1100 +/- 344) ml, and (400 +/- 112) ml respectively in group A; and (290 +/- 68) min, (1 500 +/- 489) ml, (900 +/- 269) ml respectively in group B. There was statistically significant difference between groups A and B (P {\textless} 0.05). There were significant improvements in anterior height of fractured vertebral body and Cobbs angle after operation. But there was no significant difference between groups A and B (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In Frankel grades, all patients had one grade or more improvement postoperatively. There was no significant difference between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar vertebra burst fractures with subtotal vertebrectomy, decompression and reconstruction of anterior column through posterior approach has a similar clinical result compared to the operation through combined anterior and posterior approach, but the posterior surgery decreased surgical trauma. It is an effective and safe surgical method.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: The final collapse of a "stable" thoracolumbar burst fracture is difficult to predict. This collapse was prospectively studied radiologically in patients with T12 or L1 burst fractures who, after evaluating the admission x-rays and the CT scan with the patients themselves, opted for a rigid thoracolumbar brace with support in the sternal manubrium (TLSO). On the other hand, patients with rigid braces sometimes have low back pain on follow-up (due to overload of the L5-S1 joints). HYPOTHESIS: the standing lateral x-ray with only a TLSO for support (intrinsic mechanical stability) provides information on the final collapse and could also provide information on the low back pain. The study included 50 patients (20 males and 30 females, age: 63+14 years) admitted during 2011 and 2012, with 2 losses to follow-up. VARIABLES: Farcy index and local kyphosis (Cobb at 3 vertebrae). X-Rays: admission, with TLSO (immediate: Rx0), and at 3 and 6 months. They were compared with the final clinical and radiological results. It was decided to surgically intervene in 4 patients after Rx0. There were no painful sequelae at the fracture level, and 16/44 (31{\%}) had low back pain. Using linear regression mathematical models, the increase in the Farcy index (Rx0-Rx admission) was associated with the appearance of low back pain and with local kyphosis (Rx0-Rx admission), and with the final kyphosis. It is advisable to perform a lateral standing X-ray after TLSO for information on the final collapse of the fracture and the appearance of accompanying low back pain.},

abstract = {Hypothermia and acidosis are secondary causes of trauma-related coagulopathy. Here we report the case of a 72-year-old patient with severe trauma who suffered near-severe hypothermia despite the initiation of standard warming measures and was successfully managed with active intravascular rewarming. The patient was involved in a road traffic accident and was transported to a hospital. He was diagnosed with massive right-sided hemothorax, blunt aortic injury, burst fractures of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae, and open fracture of the right tibia. He was referred to our hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to control bleeding from the right hemothorax. During surgery, the patient demonstrated progressive heat loss despite standard rewarming measures, and his temperature decreased to 32.4 degrees C. Severe acidosis was also observed. A Cool Line(R) catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and lodged in the inferior vena cava, and an intravascular balloon catheter system was utilized for aggressive rewarming. The automated target core temperature was set at 37 degrees C, and the maximum flow rate was used. His core temperature reached 36.0 degrees C after 125 min of intravascular rewarming. The severe acidosis was also resolved. The main active bleeding site was not identified, and coagulation hemostasis as well as rewarming enabled us to control bleeding from the vertebral bodies, lung parenchyma, and pleura. The total volume of intraoperative bleeding was 5,150 mL, and 20 units of red cell concentrate and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. After surgery, he was transferred to the intensive care unit under endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. His hemodynamic condition stabilized after surgery. The rewarming catheter was removed on day 2 of admission, and no bleeding, infection, or thrombosis associated with catheter placement was observed. Extubation was performed on day 40, and his subsequent clinical course was uneventful. He recovered well following rehabilitation and was discharged on day 46. These findings suggest that active intravascular rewarming should be considered as an aggressive, additional rewarming technique in patients with near-severe hypothermia associated with traumatic injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of pedicle screw fixation combined with non-fusion technology for the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture (AO type A) through Wiltse paraspinal approach. METHODS: Between March 2011 and December 2012, 35 cases of thoracolumbar fractures were treated with pedicle screw fixation combined with non- fusion technology by Wiltse paraspinal approach. There were 27 males and 8 females, aged from 19 to 51 years (mean, 39.7 years). The time from injury to operation varied from 3 to 15 days (mean, 5.9 days). The causes of injury were traffic accident in 17 cases, falling from height in 11 cases, and crush trauma in 7 cases. All fractures were single-segment fracture, including Ts in 1 case, T9 in 2 cases, T10 in 2 cases, T11 in 3 cases, T12 in 12 cases, L1 in 10 cases, L2 in 4 cases, and L3 in 1 case. According to AO classification, there were 17 type A1 fractures (compression fracture), 3 type A2 fractures (splitting fracture), and 15 type A3 fractures (burst fracture). Based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) spinal cord injury grade, all cases were in grade E before operation. Perioperative parameters were recorded; the anterior vertebral height and kyphotic Cobb angle of vertebral bodies were measured before and after operation to evaluate the effect of correction. RESULTS: The mean operating time was 74 minutes; the mean blood loss was 125 mL; and the mean drainage volume was 51 mL. Skin necrosis of incision occurred in 2 cases and was cured after dressing change; primary healing of incision was obtained in the others. All patients were followed up 15-24 months (mean, 17.3 months). No loosening or breakage of internal fixation was found. The internal fixator was removed at 12-19 months after operation (mean, 15 months). There were significant differences in Cobb's angle and anterior vertebral body height between before operation and immediately after operation, before internal fixator removal as well as at last follow- up (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant difference in anterior vertebral body height among the postoperative time points (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There was significant difference in Cobb's angle between immediately after operation and before internal fixator removal as well as at last follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05), but the difference was not significant between before internal fixator removal and at last follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The motion of fixed segment was restored after internal fixator removal. CONCLUSION: It is an effective method of pedicle screw fixation combined with non-fusion technology through Wiltse paraspinal approach for the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture (AO type A). The method has the advantages of simple operation and less trauma. It can effectively rebuild the height of vertebral body and correct kyphotic deformity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiographic findings associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures could also indicate the presence of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries, which were identified through short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR)-weighted MRI. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Sixty-four patients were surgically treated for thoracolumbar burst fractures between April 2007 and February 2014 at our institution. Twenty-four patients were excluded from this study because of the lack of STIR-weighted MRIs, and therefore 40 patients were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based upon the integrity of the PLC, which was evaluated using STIR-weighted MRI: a P group with a PLC injury and a C group without such injury. The following radiographic parameters were evaluated: loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), local kyphosis (LK), vertebral body translation, canal compromise (sagittal transverse ratio, STR), interlaminar distance (ISD), supraspinous distance (SSD) and interspinous distance (ISD). Frankel scale score and total severity score (load sharing and thoracolumbar injury classification systems, respectively) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Preoperative STIR-weighted MRI showed that 25 patients had a PLC injury (P group: 15 men and 10 women), and 15 patients did not have a PLC injury (C group: 8 men and 7 women). More patients in the P group had an LK{\textgreater}20 degrees : 14 patients in the P group and 1 patient in the C group (p{\textless}0.01). The {\%} SSD differed between the P and C groups (118.8{\%}+/-53.4{\%} and 88.0{\%}+/-24.3{\%}, respectively; p{\textless}0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that an LK{\textgreater}20 degrees was a risk factor for PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (odds ratio, 55.5 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.30-2360.1]; p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that while LOVBH, vertebral body translation, and canal compromise do not correlate significantly with the presence of a PLC injury in patients with thoracolumbar fractures, an LK{\textgreater}20 degrees and increased {\%} SSD are associated with a PLC injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature describing the application of modern segmental instrumentation to thoracic and lumbar fracture dislocation injuries is limited and the ideal surgical strategy for this severe trauma remains controversial. The purpose of this article was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of single-stage posterior reduction with segmental instrumentation and interbody fusion to treat this type of injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 30 patients who had sustained fracture dislocation of the spine and underwent single stage posterior surgery between January 2007 and December 2011 was performed. All the patients underwent single stage posterior pedicle screw fixation, decompression and interbody fusion. Demographic data, medical records and radiographic images were reviewed thoroughly. RESULTS: Ten females and 20 males with a mean age of 39.5 years were included in this study. Based on the AO classification, 13 cases were Type B1, 4 cases were B2, 4 were C1, 6 were C2 and 3 cases were C3. The average time of the surgical procedure was 220 min and the average blood loss was 550 mL. All of the patients were followed up for at least 2 years, with an average of 38 months. The mean preoperative kyphosis was 14.4 degrees and reduced to -1.1 degrees postoperatively. At the final followup, the mean kyphosis was 0.2 degrees . The loss of correction was small (1.3 degrees ) with no significant difference compared to postoperative kyphotic angle (P = 0.069). Twenty seven patients (90{\%}) achieved definitive bone fusion on X-ray or computed tomography imaging within 1 year followup. The other three patients were suspected possible pseudarthrosis. They remained asymptomatic without hardware failure or local pain at the last followup. CONCLUSION: Single stage posterior reduction using segmental pedicle screw instrumentation, combined with decompression and interbody fusion for the treatment of thoracic or lumbar fracture-dislocations is a safe, less traumatic and reliable technique. This procedure can achieve effective reduction, sagittal angle correction and solid fusion.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Multinational survey of spine trauma surgeons. OBJECTIVES: To survey spine trauma surgeons, examine the variety of management practices for thoracolumbar fractures, and investigate the need for future areas of study. BACKGROUND: Attempts to develop a universal thoracolumbar classification system represent the first step in standardizing treatment of thoracolumbar injuries, but there is little consensus regarding diagnosis and management of these injuries. METHODS: A survey questionnaire regarding a fictional neurologically intact patient with a burst fracture was administered to 46 spine surgeons. The questionnaire consisted of 2 domains: management of thoracolumbar fractures and management of postoperative infection. Survey results were compiled and evaluated and consensus arbitrarily assumed when the majority of surgeons agreed on a single question answer. RESULTS: Although majority consensus was reached on most questions, the interobserver reliability was poor. Consensus was achieved that magnetic resonance imaging should be performed during initial imaging. The majority would also operate regardless of magnetic resonance imaging findings, and would not operate at night. The favored technique was a posterior approach with decompression. Percutaneous fusion was considered a viable option by the majority of surgeons. No consensus was reached regarding instrumentation levels or construct length. The majority would use posterolateral bone grafting, and would not remove instrumentation nor perform an anterior reconstruction. Consensus was reached that postoperative bracing is unnecessary. Regarding management of infection, consensus was reached to use intraoperative vancomycin powder but not culture the nares before surgery. The majority used a set time period for antibiotic treatment when a drain was required, and would not apply supplementary bone graft at the time of final debridement and closure. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of consensus regarding the appropriate management of thoracolumbar fractures. In the future, multicenter prospective studies are necessary to establish guidelines for the management of thoracolumbar fractures.},

The patients underwent removal of bone fragments from the spinal canal through intervertebral foramen followed by short-segment fixation. Evaluations included surgery-related, such as duration of surgery and blood loss, and 12-month follow-up, such as the kyphotic angle, the height ratio of the anterior edge of the vertebra, the ratio of sagittal canal compromise, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Frankel scores. RESULTS: All patients achieved direct spinal canal decompression using the paraspinal erector approach followed by percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. The mean operation time (SD) was 173 (23) min, and the mean (SD) blood loss was 301 (104) ml. Significant improvement was noted in the kyphotic angle, 26.2 +/- 8.7 prior to operation versus 9.1 +/- 4.7 at 12 months after operation (p {\textless} 0.05); the height ratio of the anterior edge of the injured vertebra, 60 +/- 16{\%} versus 84 +/- 9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05); and the ratio of sagittal canal compromise, 46.5 +/- 11.4{\%} versus 4.3 +/- 3.6{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05). Significant improvements in VAS (7.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.7, p {\textless} 0.05), ODI (86.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 16.7 +/- 5.1, p {\textless} 0.05), and Frankel scores were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: The paraspinal erector approach was effective for direct spinal canal decompression with minimal injury in the paraspinal muscles or spine. Significant improvements in spinal function and prognostics were achieved after the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation.},

abstract = {Surviving motoneurons undergo dendritic atrophy after spinal cord injury (SCI), suggesting an important therapeutic target for neuroprotective strategies to improve recovery of function after SCI. Our previous studies showed that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SCI. In the present study, we investigated whether blocking cPLA2 pharmacologically with arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (ATK) or genetically using cPLA2 knockout (KO) mice attenuates motoneuron atrophy following SCI. C57BL/6 mice received either sham or contusive SCI at the T10 level. At 30 min after SCI, mice were treated with ATK or vehicle. Four weeks later, motoneurons innervating the vastus lateralis muscle of the quadriceps were labeled with cholera toxin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, and dendritic arbors were reconstructed in three dimensions. Soma volume, motoneuron number, lesion volume, and tissue sparing were also assessed, as were muscle weight, fiber cross-sectional area, and motor endplate size and density. ATK administration reduced percent lesion volume and increased percent volume of spared white matter compared to the vehicle-treated control animals. SCI with or without ATK treatment had no effect on the number or soma volume of quadriceps motoneurons. However, SCI resulted in a decrease in dendritic length of quadriceps motoneurons in untreated animals, and this decrease was completely prevented by treatment with ATK. Similarly, the vastus lateralis muscle weights of untreated SCI animals were smaller than those of sham-surgery controls, and these reductions were prevented by ATK treatment. No effects on fiber cross-sectional areas, motor endplate area or density were observed across treatment groups. Remarkably, genetically deleting cPLA2 in cPLA2 KO mice attenuated dendritic atrophy after SCI. These findings suggest that after SCI, cord tissue damage and regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology can be reduced by inhibition of cPLA2, further supporting a role for cPLA2 as a neurotherapeutic target for SCI treatment.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Online questionnaire survey. OBJECTIVE: To obtain the opinion of experts on whether the currently available classification systems for thoracolumbar and subaxial cervical spine injuries meet their expectations with regard to the desired objectives of a good classification system and practical implementability. METHODS: An online survey was conducted during August-September 2013 using a specially designed questionnaire. Members of Spine Trauma Study Group of International Spinal Cord Society and other spinal injury experts were approached, and responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-two spine experts responded. Majority (87.50{\%}, n=35) were involved with education and research. For subaxial cervical spine injuries, Allen Ferguson classification was more commonly used (37.50{\%}, n=15) and thought to be practically implementable in day-to-day practice (30.77{\%}). For thoracolumbar injuries, while Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) was more commonly used (47.50{\%}, n=19), the response of experts for practical implementability in day-to-day practice was more evenly distributed among TLICS, AO (Association for Osteosynthesis) and Dennis classifications (30.77, 23.08 and 25.64{\%}, respectively). Experts felt that the classification systems did not serve all the desired objectives. The reliability for residents was especially a concern. CONCLUSION: We may still be far from an ideal classification system. Many experts continue to prefer or would consider shifting back to traditional and simpler systems. There is a need for developing classification systems that would be better implementable practically in day-to-day clinical practice, better guide treatment, be more reliable, incorporate other modifiers influencing treatment and be more comprehensive in that order of priority.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The technique of short segment pedicle screw fixation (SSPSF) has been widely used for stabilization in thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBFs), but some studies reported high rate of kyphosis recurrence or hardware failure. This study was to evaluate the results of SSPSF including fractured level and to find the risk factors concerned with the kyphosis recurrence in TLBFs. METHODS: This study included 42 patients, including 25 males and 17 females, who underwent SSPSF for stabilization of TLBFs between January 2003 and December 2010. For radiologic assessments, Cobb angle (CA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), vertebral body compression ratio (VBCR), and difference between VWA and Cobb angle (DbVC) were measured. The relationships between kyphosis recurrence and radiologic parameters or demographic features were investigated. Frankel classification and low back outcome score (LBOS) were used for assessment of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 38.6 months. CA, VWA, and VBCR were improved after SSPSF, and these parameters were well maintained at the final follow-up with minimal degree of correction loss. Kyphosis recurrence showed a significant increase in patients with Denis burst type A, load-sharing classification (LSC) score {\textgreater}6 or DbVC {\textgreater}6 (p{\textless}0.05). There were no patients who worsened to clinical outcome, and there was no significant correlation between kyphosis recurrence and clinical outcome in this series. CONCLUSION: SSPSF including the fractured vertebra is an effective surgical method for restoration and maintenance of vertebral column stability in TLBFs. However, kyphosis recurrence was significantly associated with Denis burst type A fracture, LSC score {\textgreater}6, or DbVC {\textgreater}6.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected patient database. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance and relevant factors of postural kyphosis reduction during posterior surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Optimal reduction of kyphosis is a goal in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture. Several factors are known to limit the amount of posterior surgical reduction. However, few comprehensive assessments of intraoperative postural reduction have been reported. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive patients who underwent posterior surgical treatment for thoracolumbar (T11-L2) burst fracture were included. Postural reduction was evaluated using C-arm fluoroscopic images and regarded as insufficient when the lateral Cobb angle was {\textgreater}/=20 degrees or AP Cobb angle {\textgreater}/=10 degrees. Clinical characteristics including sex, age, body mass index, time to operation, injury level, and neurological injury, as well as radiologic characteristics including fracture morphology, fracture deformity, canal stenosis, and ligament injuries were investigated to determine the relevant factors. RESULTS: The mean lateral Cobb angle was 22.2+/-11.0 degrees preoperatively, 16.4+/-7.7 degrees after postural reduction (P{\textless}0.001), and 13.4+/-6.9 degrees after instrumental reduction (P{\textless}0.001). Insufficient postural reduction was found in 25 (34.7{\%}) patients, all of which were lateral. The relevant factors for insufficient reduction, as identified by multivariate analysis, were time to operation {\textgreater}72 hours (OR, 6.453; 95{\%} CI, 1.283-32.553), burst-split type injury (OR, 4.689; 95{\%} CI, 1.314-25.225), and anterior compression ratio {\textgreater}0.5 (OR, 2.284; 95{\%} CI, 1.151-19.811). CONCLUSIONS: Postural reduction plays an important role in the reduction of kyphosis and compression deformity after thoracolumbar burst fracture. However, it was affected by delayed operation time, burst-split type injury, and severe anterior vertebral compression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bisegmental dorsal stabilization is a common treatment option for instable compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine; however, it remains unknown to what extent bridging compromises intervertebral discs. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the disc height and functional features in comparison to healthy intervertebral discs after removal of the dorsal fixator and particularly under consideration of the time span between dorsal stabilization and implant removal (IR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The IR was performed in 19 patients after an average of 13 months (range 8-24 months) after dorsal stabilization of instable vertebral compression fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and lumbar spine. An additional ventral monosegmental spondylodesis was performed in 10 patients with incomplete burst fractures. Thus, a total of 28 intervertebral discs were temporarily bridged (bridged discs), with an adjacent endplate fracture in 10 (injured discs) and no adjacent bony lesion in 18 discs (healthy discs). The intervertebral discs superior and inferior to the instrumentation were selected as controls (control discs). Standardized conventional lateral radiographs were taken prior to and after IR as well as after 6 months. Additionally, standardized lateral radiographs in flexion and extension were taken. The intervertebral disc height (disc height) was determined by two independent board approved orthopedic observers by measuring the anterior, central and dorsal intervertebral disc spaces on all lateral radiographs as well as the intervertebral disc angles (disc angle) defined by the intervertebral upper and lower endplates in the flexion and extension views. Intradisc function (disc function) was defined as the difference between the disc angle in extension and flexion. The measurements were repeated after 12 months. Univariate analysis was performed using ANOVA and significance was set at p {\textless} 0.05. Interobserver and intraobserver comparisons of the disc heights and the disc angles were determined with intraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: No significant differences were seen in disc function and disc height between the controls and the bridged discs at all times of measurement; however, injured discs showed a significantly reduced disc height and disc angle in extension compared to healthy discs (p = 0.028 and p = 0.027, respectively). Additionally, patients with IR during the first 12 months had significantly reduced disc heights compared to those patients with delayed IR within the second postoperative year (p = 0.018). Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for disc function was 0.80 (95 {\%} confidence interval CI: 0.68-0.88) and 0.85 (95 {\%} CI 0.76-0.90), respectively. The interobserver and intraobserver correlations for disc height were 0.85 (95 {\%} CI: 0.76-0.90) and 0.93 (95 {\%} CI 0.88-0.95), respectively. CONCLUSION: Bridging of an intervertebral disc with IR within 24 months does not cause immediate loss of disc function or reduction of disc height; however, temporary bridging in combination with an adjacent endplate fracture causes significant reduction of disc height and loss of extension. Additionally, no beneficial effects could be seen by reducing the time span between stabilization and IR to below 12 months.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Agreement study. OBJECTIVE: To perform an independent interobserver and intraobserver agreement evaluation of the new AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The new AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System was recently published. It showed substantial reliability and reproducibility among the surgeons who developed it; however, an independent evaluation has not been performed. METHODS: Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, and computed tomographic scans of 70 patients with acute traumatic thoracolumbar injuries were selected and classified using the morphological grading of the new AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System by 6 evaluators (3 spine surgeons and 3 orthopedic surgery residents). After a 6-week interval, the 70 cases were presented in a random sequence to the same evaluators for repeat evaluation. The Kappa coefficient (kappa) was used to determine the interobserver and intraobserver agreement. RESULTS: The interobserver reliability was substantial when considering the fracture type (A, B, or C), with a kappa= 0.62 (0.57-0.66). The interobserver agreement when considering the subtypes was moderate; kappa= 0.55 (0.52-0.57). The intraobserver reproducibility was also substantial, with 85.95{\%} full intraobserver reproducibility considering the fracture type, with kappa= 0.77 (0.72-0.83), and was also substantial when considering subtypes with 75.71{\%} full agreement and kappa= 0.71 (0.67-0.76). No significant differences were observed between spine surgeons and orthopedic residents in the overall interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility, or in the inter- and intraobserver agreement of specific A, B, or C types of injuries. CONCLUSION: This classification allows adequate agreement among different observers and by the same observer on separate occasions. Future prospective studies should evaluate whether this classification improves clinical decision making.},

We compared the expression levels of aquaporins 1 and 3 in normal and degenerative lumbar intervertebral discs. Fifteen normal and 15 degenerative lumbar intervertebral disc tissues were excised from lumbar burst fracture patients during orthopedic operations at the Dali College subsidiary hospital. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the expression levels of aquaporins 1 and 3 were measured by immunohistochemistry. Hematoxylin-eosin-staining results illustrated that the structures of the intervertebral disc tissues from the control group were clear, with distinct collagen fiber shapes and slight edema but without mucoid degeneration. Structures of the intervertebral disc tissues from the disease group were obscure and disordered with hyperplastic collagen fibers and tissues of severe inflammatory edemas with necrosis mucoid degeneration. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the average absorbances of aquaporins 1 and 3 in the disease group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that the reduction of aquaporins 1 and 3 may be a factor resulting in lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fractures represent approximately 65{\%}  of all traumatic spinal fractures and are frequently associated to permanent disability with significant social and economic impact. These injuries create severe physical limitations depending on neurological status, level of fracture, severity of injury, patient age and comorbidities. Predicting neurological improvement in patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) is very difficult because it is related to different preoperative prognostic factors. We evaluated the neurological improvement related to the preoperative neurological conditions and the anatomic level of spinal cord injury. METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2010, we operated 207 patients for unstable thoracolumbar spinal fractures. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with traumatic SCIs operated on by a posterior fixation performed within 24 hours from the trauma. The preoperative neurological conditions (ASIA grade), the type of the fracture, the anatomic level of spinal cord injury and the postoperative neurological improvement were evaluated for each patient. RESULTS: The ASIA grade at admission (P = 0,0005), the fracture type according to the AO spine classification (P = 0,0002), and the anatomic location of the injury (P = 0,0213) represented predictive factors of neurological improvement at univariate analysis. The preoperative neurological status (P = 0,0491) and the fracture type (P = 0,049) confirmed a positive predictive value also in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the preoperative neurological status, the fracture type and the anatomic location of the fracture are predictive factors of the neurological outcome in patients with spinal cord injury.},

The aim of this study is the radiological and clinical mid-term evaluation of traumatic incomplete burst fractures treated by vertebral body stenting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with traumatic thoracolumbar incomplete burst fractures treated with VBS between 2009 and 2010. The outcome was evaluated with the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Score (ODI), the SF-36 Health Survey and radiologically assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with an average age of 74.8 years were treated with VBS. Twelve were female and six were male. Two years after the operation the ODI and SF-36 showed a moderate limitation of daily activities and quality of life without neurological deficits. VBS restored the vertebral kyphosis by 3.2 degrees and segmental kyphosis by 5 degrees . A minor sintering was observed at follow-up losing 0.8 degrees vertebral kyphosis and 2.1 degrees segmental kyphosis correction. Two asymptomatic cement leakages were detected. CONCLUSION: VBS provides clinical outcomes comparable with BKP. The stent allows a reconstruction of the anterior column with reduced subsequent loss of correction.},

At 6-12 and 60 months follow-up examinations, vertebral height restoration, sagittal spinal alignment and pain were recorded. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty proved to be a safe method to treat these fractures preserving a relative correct spinal sagittal balance with recovery of the morphology of the fractured vertebra, vertebral height and the angle of kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: BKP used for traumatic fractures significantly alleviates pain, does not cause notable complications and enables patients to return to their normal lives in a short time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Traditional short-segment fixation of unstable thoracolumbar  injuries can be associated with progressive kyphosis and implant failure. Load sharing classification (LSC) recommends supplemental anterior reconstruction for fractures of score 7 or greater. Posterior fixation including the fractured vertebra (PFFV) has biomechanical advantages over conventional short-segment fixation. However, its efficacy in severe thoracolumbar injuries (LSC{\textgreater}/=7) has not been studied. PURPOSE: To study the clinical, functional, and radiologic results of PFFV for severe, unstable thoracolumbar injuries (LSC{\textgreater}/=7) at a minimum of 2 years. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of case records. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-two patients with an unstable burst fracture of LSC{\textgreater}/=7 treated with PFFV were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: They included clinical outcomes: American Spinal Injury Association grade, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); and radiologic measures: segmental kyphosis angle, vertebral wedge angle, and percentage loss of anterior and posterior vertebral height. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with LSC{\textgreater}/=7 who had undergone PFFV, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were studied for demographic, injury, and surgical details. Clinical and radiologic outcomes were measured before surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The presence of screw breakage, screw pullout, peri-implant loosening, and rod breakage were considered as criteria for implant failure. RESULTS: None of the patients had postoperative implant failure at the final follow-up. The mean preoperative kyphosis angle was 22.9 degrees +/-7.6 degrees . This improved significantly to 9.2 degrees +/-6.6 degrees after surgery (p=.000). There was a loss of mean 2.4 degrees (mean kyphosis angle of 11.6 degrees +/-6.3 degrees ) at the final follow-up. The mean preoperative wedge angle was 23.0 degrees +/-8.1 degrees . This was corrected to 9.7 degrees +/-6.2 degrees (p=.000). There was a loss of kyphosis (mean 1.2 degrees ) in the follow-up period. The mean anterior and posterior vertebral height also showed significant improvements postoperatively, which were maintained at the final follow-up. The mean ODI and VAS scores at the end of 2 years were 17.5{\%} and 1.6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of unstable thoracolumbar injuries even with LSC{\textgreater}/=7 can be achieved and maintained with the use of short-segment pedicle screw fixation including the fractured vertebra, avoiding the need for anterior reconstruction. In the current era of evolving concepts of fracture fixation, the relevance of LSC in the management of unstable burst fractures is questionable.},

abstract = {The central pattern generators (CPGs) for locomotion, located in the lumbar spinal cord, are functional at birth in the rat. Their maturation occurs during the last few days preceding birth, a period during which the first projections from the brainstem start to reach the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. Locomotor burst activity in the mature intact spinal cord alternates between flexor and extensor motoneurons through reciprocal inhibition and between left and right sides through commisural inhibitory interneurons. By contrast, all motor bursts are in phase in the fetus. The alternating pattern disappears after neonatal spinal cord transection which suppresses supraspinal influences upon the locomotor networks. This article will review the role of serotonin (5-HT), in particular 5-HT2 receptors, in shaping the alternating pattern. For instance, pharmacological activation of these receptors restores the left-right alternation after injury. Experiments aimed at either reducing the endogenous level of serotonin in the spinal cord or blocking the activation of 5-HT2 receptors. We then describe recent evidence that the action of 5-HT2 receptors is mediated, at least in part, through a modulation of chloride homeostasis. The postsynaptic action of GABA and glycine depends on the intracellular concentration of chloride ions which is regulated by a protein in the plasma membrane, the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (KCC2) extruding both K(+) and Cl(-) ions. Absence or reduction of KCC2 expression leads to a depolarizing action of GABA and glycine and a marked reduction in the strength of postsynaptic inhibition. This latter situation is observed early during development and in several pathological conditions, such as after spinal cord injury, thereby causing spasticity and chronic pain. It was recently shown that specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors is able to up-regulate KCC2, restore endogenous inhibition and reduce spasticity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of integrity of dural sac in determining motor  neurological recovery in patients with cauda equinal and epiconal injuries in vertebral fractures at thoracolumbar junction. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with single-level vertebra fracture over T12-L2 with cauda equinal or epiconal injuries that underwent posterior spinal decompression and stabilization were evaluated in the period between 2006 and 2012. All patients included had motor incomplete ASIA C in neurology and were either Type B or C (AO/Magerl classification) of fracture morphology. Radiologist opinion to confirm the level of conus in MRI was done preoperatively. Intraoperative findings with respect to intactness of dura was noted. All MRI images were postoperatively evaluated by an independent, blinded radiologist for evidence of dural breach caused by the trauma. All participants provided basic demographic data, ambulatory status, and current neurology and received neurologic examination at intervals. The differences in neurologic injury sites and functional walkers in patients with different levels of vertebral injury were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to define the cut-off value of lower extremities motor score (LEMS) in functional walkers and non-walkers. All patients were seen at a postoperative follow-up of minimum 18 months. RESULTS: Data of the 31 patients were analyzed. Seventeen patients (55{\%}) had epiconus and lumbar roots lesions and 14 (45{\%}) had cauda equina lesions. The injury was at the T12 vertebra in 9 patients (29{\%}), L1 in 12 (39{\%}) and in L2 in 10 patients (32{\%}). Mean LEMS for patients with T12, L1, and L2 fractures were calculated. Fourteen patients had intraoperative findings of intact dura as against 17 patients with dural breach. MRI images when revisited by an independent radiologist by keeping him blind about the intraoperative surgeons findings showed statistically very good interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.618) with regard to integrity of the dural sac. Postoperative neurological assessment at minimum 18 months follow-up showed that four out of the 14 patients with intact dura were walkers (28{\%}) whereas of the 17 patients with dural breach, 13 were walkers (82{\%}). CONCLUSION: Neurological recovery in cauda equinal and epiconal injuries in thoracolumbar fractures is significantly less likely in an intact dural sac, probably because the dural breach prevents the roots to take as much impact as compared to an intact dural sac.},

Our purpose is to figure out which of the two treatments is more suitable for the management and outcomes of these injuries. METHODS: From 12/01/2011 to 06/30/2014 at the AO Orthopedics and Traumatology, Gaetano Rummo in Benevento, Italy, we treated 39 adult patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures according to Magerl's A1 and A2. Twenty-four patients were treated with a 3-point orthopedic corset, and 15 patients were treated with percutaneous posterior stabilization without augmentation. The patients decided on treatment after extensive explanation of the pros and cons of the two treatments. The endpoint evaluation was set at the 6-month follow-up through the evaluation of the Visual Analogue Scale, Angle's Regional Kyphosis, Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, and Denis work scale. RESULTS: The preliminary results of this prospective study show that there is a considerable advantage in functionality and pain in treating adults suffering from thoracolumbar fractures with Percutaneous technique at the expense of the bust with three points. CONCLUSIONS: Although the data are preliminary and based on data available in the literature, we can say that the Percutaneous posterior stabilization of thoracolumbar fractures in Magerl's A1 and A2 in adults is the ideal method for a good and functional alignment of the spine.},

During analysis, unusual vertebral defects were observed among the historic-era remains of two mature adults: one male, one female. In each case, the inferior endplates of two thoracic vertebral bodies exhibited midsagittal defects that resemble incomplete fractures with sclerotic reaction. These defects are described here as midsagittal vertebral infractions (MVI). Alternative diagnoses are proposed based on various causal mechanisms, including acute axial trauma in relation to Schmorl's node formation, burst fractures secondary to tonic-clonic seizure, chronic trauma due to repetitive axial stress, as well as other possibilities. Intervertebral disc herniation may have played an important part as an etiological factor, or it may have been a secondary result following traumatic disruption of the vertebral surface. Although a conclusive etiology is not proposed at this time, these antemortem midsagittal vertebral infractions may represent rare examples of burst fractures in skeletal remains or a transitional stage between traumatic episode and full recovery with resultant acute Schmorl's nodes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of unilateral pedicle screw fixation in treating thoracolumbar fractures through paraspinal approach. METHODS: From January 2006 to January 2009,21 patients with single level thoracolumbar fracture without neurological symptoms were treated with unilateral pedicle screw fixation through paraspinal approach. There were 14 males and 7 females,aged from 21 to 65 years old with a mean of 36.4 years. The duration from injury to operation ranged from 6 h to 5 d with an average of 3 d. According to the classification of Denis fracture, compression fractures happedned in 12 cases and burst fractures happened in 9 cases,including 1 case with T5 fracture, 2 cases with T7 fracture, 2 cases with T10 fracture, 3 cases with T11 fracture, 8 cases with T12 fracture, and 5 cases with L1 fracture. Based on the Flankel grade, all patients were classified as grade E. Anterior vertebral body height ratio, sagittal Cobb angle, condition of internal fixation failure, visual analogue score (VAS) were evaluated. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 12 to 36 months with an average of 20.5 months. No internal fixation failure was found. Anterior vertebral body height ratios at preoperative 3 days after operation and last follow-up were 54.3 +/- 2.8, 92.9 +/- 1.5, 93.8 +/- 1.7, respectively;sagittal Cobb angle at the three timepoints were (27.8 +/- 2.5) degrees, (5.3 +/- 0.8) degrees, (6.3 +/- 1.4) degrees, respectively; the difference was statistical significant (P {\textless} 0.05). VAS was (1.2 +/- 0.4) points at last follow-up and had obviously improved (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with unilateral pedicle screw fixation through paraspinal approach is safe with the advantages of micro-trauma and less blood loss,which can not only completely retain the posterior spinal complex structure, reinforce the spinal stability, raise the reductional quality, but also improve the strength of fixation and the distribution of stress force.},

Percutaneous techniques are becoming very popular in the last few years to reduce the approach-related morbidity associated with conventional techniques. HYPOTHESIS: Purpose of the study was to analyze the clinical and radiological outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous posterior fixation without fusion for the treatment of thoraco-lumbar and lumbar A3 fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients, having sustained a single-level thoraco-lumbar fracture, underwent short segment percutaneous instrumentation and were retrospectively analyzed. sagittal index (SI) was calculated in all patients. Clinical and functional outcome were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Short Form General Health Status (SF-36). RESULTS: Average operative blood loss was 82 mL (50-320). Mean pre-operative SI in the thoraco-lumbar segment was 13.3 degrees decreased to 5.8 degrees in the immediate postoperative with a mean deformity correction of 7.5. Mean pre-operative SI in the lumbar segment was 16.5 degrees decreased to 11.3 degrees in the immediate postoperative with a mean deformity correction of 5.2. Not statistically significant correction loss was registered at 1-year minimum follow-up. Constant clinical conditions improvement in the examined patients was observed. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for A3 thoraco-lumbar and lumbar spinal fractures is a reliable and safe procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV. Retrospective study.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 2009-2010, military physicians hypothesized that a new pattern of spinal injury had emerged, resulting from improvised explosive device assault on up-armored vehicles, associated with a high rate of point of first contact fracture and neurological injury-the combat burst fracture. We sought to determine the incidence of all thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures and combat burst fractures in 2009-2010 as compared to two antecedent years. METHODS: A screening process identified all individuals who sustained TL burst fractures in the time-period studied. Demographics, injury-specific characteristics, mechanism of injury, surgical interventions and early complications were recorded. Incidence rates were calculated for the three time periods using total deployed troop-strength and number of LRMC combat admissions as denominators. The incidences of TL burst fractures within each year group and by mechanism were compared, and clinical characteristics and process of care were described. RESULTS: Between 2007-2010, 65 individuals sustained a TL burst fracture. The incidence of these injuries in 2009-2010 was 2.1 per 10,000 soldier-years and accounted for 3.0 {\%} of LRMC combat-casualty admissions, a significant increase from 0.6 {\%} and 1.1 {\%} in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, respectively (p {\textless}/= 0.001). In 2009-2010, US soldiers were 3.4-4.6 times more likely to sustain a TL burst fracture compared to 2008-2009 and 2007-2008 (p {\textless} 0.001), and the most common mechanism of injury was IED vs. vehicle (65 {\%})-the combat burst fracture mechanism. Neurological deficits were present in 43 {\%} of TL burst fractures and 1/3 were complete injuries. Spinal fixation was performed in 68 {\%} overall and 74 {\%} of combat burst fractures. CONCLUSIONS: There was a 3.4- to 4.6-fold increase in TL burst fractures in 2009-2010 compared to antecedent years. The primary driver of this phenomenon was the marked increased in combat burst fractures. Mitigating/preventing the mechanism behind this major spinal injury is a key research initiative for the US military. Level of Evidence III (Case-control).},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Fractures of the thoracic spine involve injury at the levels of Th2 to Th10. Because of pedicle morphology, pedicle screw fixation is a demanding procedure. However, evidence on the reliability and efficiency of this technique has recently been provided by several studies. The aim of this study was to analyse a group of patients with thoracic spine fractures treated by pedicle screw fixation and to evaluate treatment outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total number of 33 patients treated by pedicle screw fixation for thoracic spine fractures between January 2007 and December 2011 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The mean age was 39.7 +/- 16.7 years. The evaluation included demographic data, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, neurological status, fracture type (AO classification), levels of the fractured vertebrae, injury-surgery interval, type and duration of surgery, type and length of pedicle screw fixation and complications. The position of pedicular screws in relation to the pedicle walls and correction of kyphotic deformity were assessed on post-operative CT scans. RESULT: Of the 33 patients, 24 had associated injuries (72.7{\%}), 22 had thorax injury (66.7{\%}) and 17 had neurological deficit (51.5{\%}). The most frequent spinal fracture type was type B2, 15 (45.5{\%}); followed by type C, nine (33.3{\%}); and type B1, five (15.1{\%}). The mean injury-to-surgery interval was 5.2 +/- 4.3 days. The mean operative time was 210 +/- 56 min. The most frequently used configuration of pedicle screw fixation involving two segments above and two below the fracture level was used in 20 cases (58.8{\%}). The position of 149 out of 282 pedicle screws (52.8{\%}) was evaluated on post-operative CT scans as follows: 98 {\%} of the pedicle screws were placed in acceptable positions, 76{\%} were placed completely within pedicle borders. The mean pre-operative Cobb angle was 18.7 degrees +/- 8.2 degrees , the mean post-operative Cobb angle was 9.3 +/- 3.4 degrees . Six intraoperative and three post-operative complications occurred. During follow-up no instrumentation failure or apparent loss of correction was recorded. DISCUSSION: Early stabilisation of thoracic spine fractures reduces the risk of complications, shortens the hospital stay and allows for faster recovery of patients. Early thoracic spine stabilisation is most beneficial in patients with a high ISS (Injury Severity Score). In the case of small-sized pedicles there is the possibility of pedicle screw insertion via an extrapedicular or parapedicular trajectory. Recommended pedicle screw fixation is two levels above and two levels below the fracture level. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screw fixation of thoracic spine fractures is a safe therapeutic method with a low risk of complications. It facilitates effective reduction and stable fixation with a low risk of secondary displacement and implant failure.

abstract = {Study Design In vitro biomechanical study. Objective To investigate the biomechanics of thoracolumbar burst and Chance-type fractures during fall from height. Methods Our model consisted of a three-vertebra human thoracolumbar specimen (n = 4) stabilized with muscle force replication and mounted within an impact dummy. Each specimen was subjected to a single fall from an average height of 2.1 m with average velocity at impact of 6.4 m/s. Biomechanical responses were determined using impact load data combined with high-speed movie analyses. Injuries to the middle vertebra of each spinal segment were evaluated using imaging and dissection. Results Average peak compressive forces occurred within 10 milliseconds of impact and reached 40.3 kN at the ground, 7.1 kN at the lower vertebra, and 3.6 kN at the upper vertebra. Subsequently, average peak flexion (55.0 degrees) and tensile forces (0.7 kN upper vertebra, 0.3 kN lower vertebra) occurred between 43.0 and 60.0 milliseconds. The middle vertebra of all specimens sustained pedicle and endplate fractures with comminution, bursting, and reduced height of its vertebral body. Chance-type fractures were observed consisting of a horizontal split fracture through the laminae and pedicles extending anteriorly through the vertebral body. Conclusions We hypothesize that the compression fractures of the pedicles and vertebral body together with burst fracture occurred at the time of peak spinal compression, 10 milliseconds. Subsequently, the onset of Chance-type fracture occurred at 20 milliseconds through the already fractured and weakened pedicles and vertebral body due to flexion-distraction and a forward shifting spinal axis of rotation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, conservative treatment of thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures without neurologic deficit has encompassed the application of an extension brace. However, their effectiveness on maintaining the alignment, preventing posttraumatic deformities, and improving back pain, disability and quality of life is doubtful. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether bracing patients who suffer TL fractures adds benefices to the conservative manage without bracing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven databases were searched for relevant RCTs that compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of orthosis versus no-orthosis for TL burst fractures managed conservatively. Primary outcomes were: (1) Loss of kyphotic angle; (2) failure of conservative management requiring subsequent surgery; and (3) disability and pain outcomes. Secondary outcomes were defined by health-related quality of life and in-hospital stay. RESULTS: Based on predefined inclusion criteria, only two eligible high-quality RCTs with a total of 119 patients were included. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding loss of kyphotic angle, pain outcome, or in-hospital stay. The pooled data showed higher scores in physical and mental domains of the Short-Form Health Survey 36 in the group treated without orthosis. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The current evidence suggests that orthosis could not be necessary when TL burst fractures without neurologic deficit are treated conservatively. However, due to limitations related with number and size of the included studies, more RCTs with high quality are desirable for making recommendations with more certainty.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Minimally invasive spinal (MIS) surgery techniques have been used sporadically in thoracolumbar junction trauma cases in the past 5 years. A review of the literature on the treatment of thoracolumbar trauma treated with MIS surgery revealed no unifying algorithm to assist with treatment planning. Therefore, the authors formulated a treatment algorithm. METHODS: The authors reviewed the current literature on MIS treatment of thoracolumbar trauma. Based on the literature review, they then created an algorithm for the treatment of thoracolumbar trauma utilizing MIS techniques. This MIS trauma treatment algorithm incorporates concepts form the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (TLICS). RESULTS: The authors provide representative cases of patients with thoracolumbar trauma who underwent MIS surgery utilizing the MIS trauma treatment algorithm. The cases involve the use of mini-open lateral approaches and/or minimally invasive posterior decompression with or without fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Cases involving thoracolumbar trauma can safely be treated with MIS surgery in select cases of burst fractures. The role of percutaneous nonfusion techniques remains very limited (primarily to treat thoracolumbar trauma in patients with a propensity for autofusion [for example, those with ankylosing spondylitis]).},

abstract = {As a result of axial compression, traumatic vertebral burst fractures disrupt the anterior column, leading to segmental instability and cord compression. In situations with diminished anterior column support, pedicle screw fixation alone may lead to delayed kyphosis, nonunion, and hardware failure. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty (balloon-assisted vertebroplasty) have been used in an effort to provide anterior column support in traumatic burst fractures. Cited advantages are providing immediate stability, improving pain, and reducing hardware malfunction. When used in isolation or in combination with posterior instrumentation, these techniques theoretically allow for improved fracture reduction and maintenance of spinal alignment while avoiding the complications and morbidity of anterior approaches. Complications associated with cement use (leakage, systemic effects) are similar to those seen in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures; however, extreme caution must be used in fractures with a disrupted posterior wall.},

abstract = {Traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine are relatively common occurrences  that can be a source of pain and disability. Similarly, osteoporotic vertebral fractures are also frequent events and represent a significant health issue specific to the elderly. Neurologically intact patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures can commonly be treated nonoperatively with bracing. Nonoperative treatment is not suitable for patients with neurological deficits or highly unstable fractures. The role of operative versus nonoperative treatment of burst fractures is controversial, with high-quality evidence supporting both options. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be managed with bracing or vertebral augmentation in most cases. There is, however, a lack of high-quality evidence comparing operative versus nonoperative fractures in this population. Bracing is a low-risk, cost-effective method to treat certain thoracolumbar fractures and offers efficacy equivalent to that of surgical management in many cases. The evidence for bracing of osteoporotic-type fractures is less clear, and further investigation will be necessary to delineate its optimal role.},

As such, there is a great need for validated preclinical models in which to study these injuries. In this study, an electronic search of the PubMed database (MEDLINE) was performed and the results were filtered to obtain only studies with a biomechanical focus. Forty five biomechanical studies were obtained, from which four distinct methods of injury induction were identified. Twenty one (46.7{\%}) involved clinically relevant techniques for treating BF, involving anterior, posterior, circumferential, or a combination of approaches. Fifteen (71.4{\%}) of the treatment studies used unstable spine specimens that do not fit the classical characteristics of BF. Given the consistent use of BF models that do not adhere to classical definitions, the clinical value of ex vivo induction is uncertain.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. PURPOSE: The aim of present study was to investigate imaging findings suggestive of cauda equina entrapment in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Burst fractures with cauda equina entrapment can cause neurologic deterioration during surgery. However, dural tears and cauda equina entrapment are very difficult to diagnose clinically or radiographically before surgery. METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent spinal surgery for thoracolumbar or lumbar burst fractures were enrolled in this study. In magnetic resonance imaging T2-weighted images of the transverse plane, we defined cauda equina notch sign (CENS) as a v-shaped image that entrapped cauda equina gathers between lamina fractures. We evaluated the fractured spine by using CENS and lamina fractures and the rate of available space for the spinal canal at the narrowest portion of the burst fracture level. We classified patients into entrapment group or non-entrapment group, based on whether cauda equina entrapment existed. RESULTS: Lamina fractures were detected in 18 (78.3{\%}) and CENS were detected in 6 (26.1{\%}) of 23 burst-fracture patients. Cauda equina entrapment existed in all the patients with CENS. In addition, the rate of available space for the spinal canal increased according to logistic regression. The size of the retropulsed fragment in the spinal canal was the most reliable of all the factors, suggesting cauda equina entrapment. CONCLUSIONS: CENS was the most predictable sign of cauda equina entrapment associated with burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Classic biomechanical models have used thoracic spines disarticulated from the rib cage, but the biomechanical influence of the rib cage on fracture biomechanics has not been investigated. The well-accepted construct for stabilizing midthoracic fractures is posterior instrumentation 3 levels above and 2 levels below the injury. Short-segment fixation failure in thoracolumbar burst fractures has led to kyphosis and implant failure when anterior column support is lacking. Whether shorter constructs are viable in the midthoracic spine is a point of controversy. The objective of this study was the biomechanical evaluation of a burst fracture at T-9 with an intact rib cage using different fixation constructs for stabilizing the spine. METHODS: A total of 8 human cadaveric spines (C7-L1) with intact rib cages were used in this study. The range of motion (ROM) between T-8 and T-10 was the outcome measure. A robotic spine testing system was programmed to apply pure moment loads (+/- 5 Nm) in lateral bending, flexion-extension, and axial rotation to whole thoracic specimens. Intersegmental rotations were measured using an optoelectronic system. Flexibility tests were conducted on intact specimens, then sequentially after surgically induced fracture at T-9, and after each of 4 fixation construct patterns. The 4 construct patterns were sequentially tested in a nondestructive protocol, as follows: 1) 3 above/2 below (3A/2B); 2) 1 above/1 below (1A/1B); 3) 1 above/1 below with vertebral body augmentation (1A/1B w/VA); and 4) vertebral body augmentation with no posterior instrumentation (VA). A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare the segmental motion between T-8 and T-10 vertebrae. RESULTS: Mean ROM increased by 86{\%}, 151{\%}, and 31{\%} after fracture in lateral bending, flexion-extension, and axial rotation, respectively. In lateral bending, there was significant reduction compared with intact controls for all 3 instrumented constructs: 3A/2B (-92{\%}, p = 0.0004), 1A/1B (-63{\%}, p = 0.0132), and 1A/1B w/VA (-66{\%}, p = 0.0150). In flexion-extension, only the 3A/2B pattern showed a significant reduction (-90{\%}, p = 0.011). In axial rotation, motion was significantly reduced for the 3 instrumented constructs: 3A/2B (-66{\%}, p = 0.0001), 1A/1B (-53{\%}, p = 0.0001), and 1A/1B w/VA (-51{\%}, p = 0.0002). Between the 4 construct patterns, the 3 instrumented constructs (3A/2B, 1A/1B, and 1A/1B w/VA) showed comparable stability in all 3 motion planes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no significant difference in the stability of the 3 instrumented constructs tested when the rib cage is intact. Fractures that might appear more grossly unstable when tested in the disarticulated spine may be bolstered by the ribs. This may affect the extent of segmental spinal instrumentation needed to restore stability in some spine injuries. While these initial findings suggest that shorter constructs may adequately stabilize the spine in this fracture model, further study is needed before these results can be extrapolated to clinical application.},

However, we did not know the extent of difference between them. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the differences seen in thoracolumbar burst fractures on lateral radiographs and CT sagittal reconstruction images and investigate their clinical relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lateral radiographs and CT sagittal reconstruction images of 45 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were used to record the following measurements: the compressed area of the fractured vertebrae, from lateral radiographs, and the sagittal compressed area, bony fragment area, and total fracture-involved area, from CT sagittal reconstruction images. RESULTS: The percentage of compressed area of fractured vertebrae was 29.32+/-13.80{\%} on lateral radiographs and 27.93+/-12.21{\%} on CT sagittal reconstruction images; there was no significant difference between them (P{\textgreater}0.05). The percentage of total fracture-involved area was 53.20+/-20.64{\%} on CT sagittal reconstruction images, higher than the compressed area measured on lateral radiographs (P{\textless}0.01) and CT sagittal reconstruction images (P{\textless}0.01). The percentage of bony fragment area was 25.27+/-15.18{\%} on CT sagittal reconstruction images; there was no significant relationship between bony fragment area and the compressed area (r=0.1258, P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The compressed area of fractured vertebrae on lateral radiographs could not represent the fracture-involved area and underestimated the total fracture-involved area. We suggested that the above 3 parameters could be easily obtained on CT sagittal reconstruction images, which might be better for assessing the potential instability of the thoracolumbar burst fracture and could become a valuable and indispensable examination for therapeutic decision making.},

abstract = {In the past 15 years, major advances have been made in understanding the role of  lipids in podocyte biology. First, susceptibility to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and glomerular disease is associated with an APOL1 sequence variant, is expressed in podocytes and encodes apolipoprotein L1, an important component of HDL. Second, acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3b encoded by SMPDL3b has a role in the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide and its levels are reduced in renal biopsy samples from patients with recurrent FSGS. Furthermore, decreased SMPDL3b expression is associated with increased susceptibility of podocytes to injury after exposure to sera from these patients. Third, in many individuals with membranous nephropathy, autoantibodies against the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) receptor, which is expressed in podocytes, have been identified. Whether these autoantibodies affect the activity of PLA2, which liberates arachidonic acid from glycerophospholipids and modulates podocyte function, is unknown. Fourth, clinical and experimental evidence support a role for ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1-dependent cholesterol efflux, free fatty acids and glycerophospolipids in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. An improved understanding of lipid biology in podocytes might provide insights to develop therapeutic targets for primary and secondary glomerulopathies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A thoracolumbar burst fracture is usually unstable and can cause neurological deficits and angular deformity. Patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture usually need surgery for decompression of the spinal canal, correction of the angular deformity, and stabilization of the spinal column. We compared two struts, titanium mesh cages (TMCs) and expandable cages. METHODS: 33 patients, who underwent anterior thoracolumbar reconstruction using either TMCs (n=16) or expandable cages (n=17) between June 2000 and September 2011 were included in this study. Clinical outcome was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) for functional neurological evaluation. The Cobb angle, body height of the fractured vertebra, the operation time and amount of intra-operative bleeding were measured in both groups. RESULTS: In the expandable cage group, operation time and amount of intraoperative blood loss were lower than that in the TMC group. The mean VAS scores and LBOS in both groups were improved, but no significant difference. Cobb angle was corrected higher than that in expandable cage group from postoperative to the last follow-up. The change in Cobb angles between preoperative, postoperative, and the last follow-up did not show any significant difference. There was no difference in the subsidence of anterior body height between both groups. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the change in Cobb angles with an inter-group comparison, the expandable cage group showed better results in loss of kyphosis correction, operation time, and amount of intraoperative blood loss.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission influences cognition and recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We explored whether functional genetic variants affecting the DA transporter (DAT) and D2 receptor (DRD2) impacted in vivo dopaminergic binding with positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]betaCFT and [(11)C]raclopride. We examined subjects with moderate/severe TBI (N=12) approximately 1 year post injury and similarly matched healthy controls (N=13). The variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism within the DAT gene and the TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism near the DRD2 gene were assessed. TBI subjects had age-adjusted DAT-binding reductions in the caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum, and modestly increased D2 binding in ventral striatum versus controls. Despite small sample sizes, multivariate analysis showed lower caudate and putamen DAT binding among DAT 9-allele carriers and DRD2 A2/A2 homozygotes with TBI versus controls with the same genotype. Among TBI subjects, 9-allele carriers had lower caudate and putamen binding than 10/10 homozygotes. This PET study suggests a hypodopaminergic environment and altered DRD2 autoreceptor DAT interactions that may influence DA transmission after TBI. Future work will relate these findings to cognitive performance; future studies are required to determine how DRD2/DAT1 genotype and DA-ligand binding are associated with neurostimulant response and TBI recovery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with short-segment posterior instrumentation without anterior column support is associated with a high incidence of implant failure and correction loss. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results following posterior short-segment instrumentation and limited segmental decompression supplemented with vertebroplasty with calcium sulphate and intermediate screws for patients with severe thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures of LSC point 7 or more underwent this procedure. The average follow-up was 27.5 months. Demographic data, radiographic parameters, neurologic function, clinical outcomes and treatment-related complications were prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Loss of vertebral body height and segmental kyphosis was 55.3 {\%} and 20.2 degrees before surgery, which significantly improved to 12.2 {\%} and 5.4 degrees at the final follow-up, respectively. Loss of kyphosis correction was 2.2 degrees . The preoperative canal encroachment was 49 {\%} that significantly improved to 8.8 {\%}. The preoperative pain and function level showed a mean VAS score of 9.2 and ODI of 89.9 {\%} that improved to 1.4 and 12.9 {\%} at the final follow-up, respectively. No implant failure was observed in this series, and cement leakage occurred in two cases without clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent reduction and maintenance of thoracolumbar burst fractures can be achieved with short-segment pedicle instrumentation supplemented with anterior column reconstruction and intermediate screws. The resultant circumferential stabilization combined with a limited segmental decompression resulted in improved neurologic function and satisfactory clinical outcomes, with a low incidence of implant failure and progressive deformity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanical effects of augmentation of the fractured vertebrae after posterior instrumentation. METHODS: By simulating internal fixation plus augmentation with cement, eight tridimensional, anatomically detailed finite element models of the T11-L1 functional spinal junction were developed. Two kinds of models for mimicking different severity of the fracture were established according to the Denis' classification. Augmentation with cement was conducted after reduction with posterior fixation using a universal spine system. These models assumed a three-column loading configuration as follows: compression, anteflexion, extension, lateroflexion and axial rotation. Stress of the implants and spine was evaluated. RESULTS: Data showed that for severely fractured models, augmentation apparently decreased the von Mises stresses by 50{\%} for the rods and 40{\%} for the screws, about 40{\%} for the inferior endplate of T11, and 50{\%} for the superior endplate of L1 in vertical compression and other load situations. CONCLUSION: We should only apply vertebroplasty to prevent correction loss and implants failure based on the fact that it could significantly decrease stress of the instrumentations and spine when the vertebrae are severely fractured.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of utilizing self-designed score system for lower lumbar vertebral burst fractures to select surgical approach. METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2011, the clinical data of 56 patients with lower lumbar vertebra burst fractures who underwent surgical treatment were retrospectively analyzed. There were 42 males and 14 females with an average age of 43.1 years old (ranged, 19 to 65). Causes of injury included falling down (40 cases), traffic accidents (12 cases), and crashing injury by heavy objects(4 cases). Injury site was L3 in 37 cases, L4 in 16 cases, and L5 in 3 cases. According to the AO classification, 17 cases were type A3.1, 14 cases were type A3.2, 25 cases were type A3.3. According to Frankel grade of nerous function, 2 cases were grade B, 5 cases were grade C, 9 cases were grade D and 40 cases were grade E. Surgical methods and approaches were chosen based on the comprehensive evaluation of AO classification, condition of posterior column injury and spinal canal encroachment. Surgical methods and approaches included trans-vertebra fixation (15 cases), intra-vertebra pedicle screw fixation (21 cases), combination of anterior and posterior approaches (11 cases), one-stage posterior approaches (9 cases). Cobb angles, restorations of the affected vertebral anterior border height, and conditions of spinal canal encroachment were compared before and after surgery. Conditions of bone graft fusion and internal fixation (if bending, loosening or breakage existed) were observed. Spinal cord functions were assessed according to Frankel grade. Localized pain and working status of patients were also assessed at the last follow-up. RESULTS: No incision infection was found and no spinal nerve symptoms improved in all of 56 patients. All patients were followed up for 12 to 60 months with a mean of 28.5 months, without internal fixation loosening or breakage. There was significant differences in Cobb angle, vertebral anterior border height and recovery of spinal canal encroachment between preoperative and postoperative instantly (P {\textless} 0.05), however, there was no significant difference between postoperative instantly and final follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Thirteen cases obtained fusion by trans-vertebra fixation, 20 cases obtained fusion by intra-vertebra fixation, and 20 cases were treated by the combination of anterior and posterior approaches or one-stage posterior approaches all of patients obtained fusion. Spinal nervous function recovered I to II grade, 1 case was grade C, 3 cases were grade D, 52 cases were grade E. Localized pain was assessed as P1 in 52 cases, P2 in 3 cases, and P3 in 1 case. Working status was classified into W1 in 12 cases, W2 in 39 cases, and W3 in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: The lower lumbar vertebra and thoracolumbar junction exhibit different injury characteristics due to variations in anatomy and biomechanics. A comprehensive score of the AO classification, posterior column injury and degree of spinal canal encroachment will guide the selection of surgical method and approach for the treatment of lower lumbar vertebra burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of short-segment transpedicular fixation and vertebroplasty via paraspinal intermuscular approach in treating thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: From January 2009 to January 2012,18 patients with thoracolumbar fractures without neurological symptoms were treated with short-segment transpedicular fixation and vertebroplasty via paraspinal intermuscular approach. There were 11 males and 7 females, aged from 52 to 76 years old with an average of 62.2 years. The duration from injuries to surgery ranged from 8 h to 7 d with an average of 4.2 d. According to the Denis fracture classification, 12 cases got compression fractures and 6 cases got burst fractures. LOCATION: 6 vertebra with T12, 9 with L1, 6 with L2, and 3 with L3. Anterior vertebral body height, the sagittal Cobb angle, the sagittal index (SI), condition of internal fixation failure and recurrent kyphosis were observed. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12-28 months with an average of 16.5 months. Operation time was from 80 to 130 min with a mean of 95 min and bleeding volume during operation ranged from 100 to 180 ml with a mean of 145 ml. Anterior vertebral body height ratios preoperation, 3 days after operation and final follow-up was 54.3 +/- 2.8, 90.9 +/- 1.5, 88.6 +/- 1.7, respectively; sagittal Cobb angle was (27.8 +/- 2.5) degrees, (5.3 +/- 0.8) degrees, (6.3 +/- 1.4) degrees, respectively; sagittal index was 52.3 +/- 3.8, 89.2 +/- 5.2, 86.4 +/- 4.5, respectively. Data obtained 3 days after operation obviously improved than preoperation, and there was no statistically significant difference between 3 days after operation and last follow-up. No internal fixation failure, neurological complications and recurrent kyphosis were found. CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with short-segment transpediclar screw fixation and vertebroplasty via paraspinal intermuscular approach can retain the posterior ligament complex and restore the mechanical strength of the anterocentral column,which proved an ideal method for preventing the failure of internal fixation and reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adulthood may be associated with a decreased bone mineral density (BMD), a decreased bone mineral content (BMC) and an increased fracture risk. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) replacement induces a progressive increase in BMD for up to 5-7 years of treatment. Data on longer follow-up are, however, scarce. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-adult GHD patients (mean age 47.1 years, 52.6{\%} female), of whom 88{\%} patients had adult-onset (AO) GHD, receiving rhGH replacement for {\textgreater}/=5 years were included in the study. Most patients had multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. Bone turnover markers, BMC and BMD and T-scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were evaluated at baseline, and after 5, 10 and 15 years of rhGH replacement. In addition, clinical fracture incidence was assessed. RESULTS: Mean lumbar spine BMD, lumbar spine BMC and T-scores gradually increased during the first 10 years of rhGH replacement and remained stable thereafter. Largest effects of rhGH supplementation were found in men. In the small subset of patients using bisphosphonates, use of bisphosphonates did not impact additional beneficial effects in the long term. Low baseline BMD positively affected the change in BMD and BMC over time, but there was a negative effect of high GH dose at 1 year on the change in BMD and BMC over time. Clinical fracture incidence during long-term rhGH replacement was 20.1/1000 py. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen years of rhGH replacement in GHD adults resulted in a sustained increase in BMD values at the lumbar spine, particularly in men, and stabilization of BMD values at the femoral neck. Clinical fracture incidence was suggested not to be increased during long-term rhGH replacement.},

METHODS: Among thirty-two Japanese male big-ear rabbits, 8 rabbits were randomly selec ted as a blank group, the rest 24 rabbits were fed with method of endothelial injury and high-fat diet to establish AS model. The blank group was raised with normal diet and free water. After ten weeks of model establishment, the rest 24 rabbits were randomly divided into a model group, a moxibustion group and a medicine group, eight rabbits in each one. Moxibustion was applied at "Shenque" (CV 8) and "Zusanli" (ST 36) for 10 min per acupoint per day in the moxibustion group, while intragastric administration of 3.6 mg/kg lovastatin capsule was applied in the medicine group. After treatment, serum was acquired. Spectrophotometry method was adapted to measure cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and evaluated atherosclerosis index (AI), while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was used to measure interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). RESULTS: (1) The serum TC and HDL-C in the model group were significantly higher than those in the blank group, moxibustion group and medicine group (all P {\textless} 0.01). The mean value of AI was 1.683 +/- 0.486 in the moxibustion group, which was obviously lower than 20.301 +/- 4.022 in the model group (P {\textless} 0.01). (2) The ratio of Th1/Th2 was 0.569 +/- 0.143 in the moxibustion group and 0.445 +/- 0.079 in the medicine group, which were significantly lower than 0.917 +/- 0.255 in the model group (both P {\textless} 0.01), but there was no statistically significant difference between the moxibustion group and the medicine group (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The moxibustion for AS could reduce atherosclerosis index, influence drift and bias of helper T cell and regulate balance between humoral immunity and cellular immunity. As a result, status of relative balance of immunity is acquired, which could slow down the development of atherosclerosis and process of thrombus burst.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to assess the degree of exposure of the orthopedic surgical team to fluoroscopic ionizing radiation. METHODS: the ionizing radiation to which the orthopedic surgical team (R1, R2 and R3) was exposed was assayed using thermoluminescent dosimeters that were distributed in target anatomical regions (regions with and without protection using a lead apron). This was done during 45 hip osteosynthesis procedures to treat transtrochanteric fractures that were classified as 31-A2.1 (AO). RESULTS: the radioactive dose received by R3 was 6.33 mSv, R2 4.51 mSv and R3 1.99 mSv (p = 0.33). The thyroid region received 0.86 mSv of radiation, the thoracic region 1.24 mSv and the gonadal region 2.15 mSv (p = 0.25). There was no record of radiation at the dosimeters located below the biosafety protectors or on the team members' backs. CONCLUSIONS: the members of the surgical team who were located closest to the fluoroscope received greater radiation doses than those located further away. The anatomical regions located below the waistline were the ones that received most ionizing radiation. These results emphasize the importance of using biosafety devices, since these are effective in preventing radiation from reaching the vital organs of the medical team.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that human nucleus pulposus contain mesenchymal stem cells (NP-MSCs). However, the immunophenotypic variation of NP-MSCs in vitro was unclear. The present study was conducted to address the immunophenotypic variation of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus under continuous proliferation in vitro and show the difference between mesenchymal stem cells and nucleus pulposus cell. METHODS: Tissue samples were obtained from thoracolumbar burst fracture patients and degenerative disc disease patients who underwent discectomy and fusion procedures. Flow cytometric and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) were used to detect the variation of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus which were expressing CD105 and CD24 in condition with or without transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). RESULTS: More than 90{\%} of the analyzed primary cells of mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus fulfilled the general immunophenotyping criteria for MSCs, such as CD44, CD105 and CD29, but the marker of mature NP cells characterized as CD24 was negative. In continuous cultures, the proportion of mesenchymal stem cells which were expressing CD44, CD105 and CD29 in nucleus pulposus gradually decreased. The mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus cells were positive for CD105 and CD29, with slight positivity for CD44. The CD24 expression gradually increased in proliferation. Biparametric flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of cells which were expressing CD105 and CD24 independently, and only a small part of cells expressed both CD105 and CD24 simultaneously. TGF-beta1 could stimulate mesenchymal stem cells in nucleus pulposus to express CD24. CONCLUSIONS: Non-degenerative and degenerative NP contains mesechymal stem cells. The variation of CD24 can be used as a marker to identify the NP-MSCs differentiation into NP-like cells.},

METHODS: Nineteen patients (12 male, 7 female; mean age: 34.4 years, range: 19 to 57 years) with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated using PS-LH between 1996 and 2006 were evaluated. The 17 patients (11 male, 6 female) who had a minimum of 2 years follow-up were included in the study. Radiographic outcome was evaluated by measuring the local kyphosis angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral height (AVH). Mean follow-up was 81 (range: 38 to 122) months and 15 patients completed more than 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Preoperative vertebral height loss and LKA of 41.2{\%} (range: 29{\%} to 64{\%}) and 16.8 degrees (range: 5 degrees to 36 degrees ), respectively, were corrected to 16.3{\%} (range: 0{\%} to 44{\%}) and -1.2 degrees (range: -17 degrees to 10 degrees ), respectively, after the operation. Mean losses of correction for vertebral height and local kyphosis were 1.8 +/- 7.9{\%} and 4.3 +/- 7.1 degrees, respectively, at the 2-year follow-up and -1.8 +/- 4.5{\%} and 0.5 +/- 1.5 degrees, respectively, between 2 years and 5 years. Loss of correction was significant for the LKA (p=0.023) but not for vertebral height (p=0.360). Five patients had losses of correction of more than 5 degrees. Changes between 2 and 5 years were not significant for vertebral height loss and local kyphosis (p=0.147 and p=0.205, respectively) and remained improved when compared with the preoperative values (p{\textless}0.001). Average SF-36 scores of the 15 patients evaluated at the final follow-up were comparable with the general Turkish population. CONCLUSION: The PS-LH construct provided a significant correction of the local kyphotic deformity. Augmentation of the upper and lower pedicle screw by the sublaminar hook did not completely prevent correction loss but was found to stabilize at the 5th year of follow-up without any clinical problems.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The intermediate screw in a fractured vertebra works as a pressure  point with an anterior vector thus creating a lordotic force that corrects kyphosis, provides appropriate three-point fixation and decreases the lever effect. OBJECTIVE: To describe the course of non-pathologic traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine after instrumentation of the fractured vertebra. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 37 patients with a diagnosis of traumatic vertebral fracture in the thoracolumbar area (T9-L4) were operated from January 2008 to December 2012. Patients included 28 males (75.6{\%}) and 9 females (24.4{\%}); mean age was 41.8 years. RESULTS: Correcting the total diameter of the spinal canal results in a 2.11 times higher chance of neurologic improvement; the relative risk of fusion was 0.97 with autologous graft as compared with a heterologous graft (CI 95{\%} = 0.69-1.36) and 1.18 with instrumentation of the fractured vertebra (CI 95{\%} = 0.42-3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screw fixation at the fracture level is a safe and effective method to treat thoracolumbar fractures; it provides additional fixation points that assist in fracture reduction and correction of kyphosis, improving at the same time back pain and maintaining the corrective effect. Procedure indications include integrity of the posterior ligament complex and at least one intact pedicle in the fractured vertebra.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The thoracolumbar junction is the most common area of injury to the axial skeleton. Forces along the long stiff kyphotic thoracic spine switch abruptly into the mobile lordotic lumbar spine at the thoracolumbar junction. Goals of treatment are to obtain a painless, balanced, stable spine with optimum neurological function and maximum spine mobility. The present prospective study has evaluated the effectiveness of pedicle screw instrumentation in various fractures around the TL spine to overcome the complications encountered in the conservative line of management of these fractures. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS: Thirty cases of fractures around the TL spine were operated with posterior pedicle screw fixation one or two level above and below the fracture. The cases were followed up for a mean of 9.5 months with radiological and neurological evaluation. RESULTS: The average age groups of the patients studied were 21 to 53 years majority were males, fall from height being the predominant mode of injury involving the T12 and L1 vertebral body. The unstable burst fractures the most common type of fracture, radiological parameters sagittal angle and index were recorded pre and post-operatively. The neurological grading was done using the ASIA score. Follow-up was done for a minimum of 5 months where sagittal angle reduction achieved was 10.75 at final follow-up from 23.5 pre-operative. The sagittal index achieved at final follow-up was 72{\%} compared to the pre-operative mean of 53{\%}. The neurological improvement was regarded to be fair enough for the type of injury sustained and fixation achieved. CONCLUSION: We found that the application of posterior instrumentation using pedicle screw and rod resulted in a reasonable correction of the deformity with a significant reduction in recumbency-associated complications; the limiting factor being the small study group and short follow-up period.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of implant removal of percutaneous short segment fixation after vertebral fracture consolidation in terms of motion preservation. METHODS: Between May 2007 and January 2011, 44 patients underwent percutaneous short segment screw fixation due to a thoracolumbar burst fracture. Sixteen of these patients, who underwent implant removal 12 months after screw fixation, were enrolled in this study. Motor power was intact in all patients, despite significant vertebral height loss and canal compromise. The patients were divided into two groups by degree of osteoporosis : Group A (n=8), the non-osteoporotic group, and Group B (n=8), the osteoporotic group. Imaging and clinical findings including vertebral height loss, kyphotic angle, range of motion (ROM), and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at final follow-up versus preoperative values. In terms of vertebral height loss, both groups showed significant improvement at 12 months after screw fixation and restored vertebral height was maintained to final follow-up in spite of some correction loss. ROM (measured using Cobb's method) in flexion and extension in Group A was 10.5 degrees (19.5/9.0 degrees ) at last follow-up, and in Group B was 10.2 degrees (18.8/8.6 degrees ) at last follow-up. Both groups showed marked improvement in ROM as compared with the screw fixation state, which was considered motionless. CONCLUSION: Removal of percutaneous implants after vertebral fracture consolidation can be an effective treatment to preserve motion regardless of osteoporosis for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

The load-sharing classification (LSC) is a straightforward way to describe the extent of bony comminution, amount of fracture displacement, and amount of correction of kyphotic deformity in a spinal fracture. There are no studies evaluating the relevance of fracture comminution/traumatic kyphosis on the long-term radiologic outcome of burst fractures treated by short-segment instrumentation with screw insertion in the fractured level. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the six-screw construct in the treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures and the influence of the LSC score on the 2-year radiologic outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Case series of consecutive patients of a single university hospital. PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive patients from one university hospital with nonosteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Being a radiology-based study, the outcome measures are radiologic parameters (regional kyphosis [RK], local kyphosis, and thoracolumbar kyphosis [TLK]) that evaluate the degree and loss of correction. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with nonosteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures managed with a six-screw construct in a single university hospital, with more than 2 years' postoperative follow-up. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients met the inclusion criteria, and 72 (83.7{\%}) with available data were ultimately included in the study. The sample included 53 men and 19 women, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 35.6 years (14.4 years) at the time of surgery. Mean LSC score was 6.3 (SD 1.6, range 3-9). Forty-four of 62 (70.9) fractures had a score greater than 6. Mean (SD) RK and TLK deteriorated significantly during the first 6 months of follow-up: 2.90 degrees (4.54 degrees ) p=.005 and 2.78 degrees (6.45 degrees ) p=.069, respectively. Surgical correction correlated significantly (r=0.521, p{\textless}.0001) with the time elapsed until surgery. Loss of surgical correction (postoperative to 6-month RK and TLK increase) correlated significantly with the LSC score (r=0.57, p=.004; r=0.51, p=.022, respectively). Further surgery because of correction loss was not required in any case. CONCLUSIONS: The six-screw construct is effective for treating thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. The medium-to-long-term loss of correction is affected by the amount of bony comminution of the fracture, objectified through the LSC score.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Despite promising early clinical results, the long-term outcome of the use of expandable titanium cages to reconstruct the anterior column after traumatic burst fractures is still unknown. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of the use of expandable titanium cages 5 years postoperatively. METHODS: Eighty patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures (T4-L5) underwent posterior stabilization followed by anterior corpectomy and reconstruction using expandable titanium cages with or without additional anterior plating. After 5 years, fusion was evaluated by means of plain radiographs and CT scans, and the patients' scores on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), their neurological status, and clinical results were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-five (56{\%}) of the 80 patients could be examined after 5 years. There was a relatively high rate of complications related to thoracotomy (26{\%}), but there were no complications directly related to the cages. Revision surgery was required in 1 case. The average postoperative loss of correction was only 2.4 degrees due to minimal subsidence of the cages. No cage showed a radiolucent line or instability in flexion-extension views. Bony fusion, as assessed by CT scan, was achieved in 41 patients (91{\%}). On clinical examination, 96{\%} of all patients were ambulatory and showed minimal restriction of spinal range of motion; 71{\%} did not need analgesic medication at all; and 67{\%} were able to work. The average ODI score was 12. Thirty-one percent of patients complained of some kind of anterior approach-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Combined anteroposterior stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures with expandable titanium cages is a relative safe procedure with satisfactory radiological and clinical long-term outcome. High fusion rates can be achieved, with only minor loss of correction, typically occurring in the 1st year. However, open thoracotomy carries the risks of additional complications and development of post-thoracotomy syndrome.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) was developed to improve injury classification and guide surgical decision making, yet validation remains necessary. This study evaluates the neurological outcome of patients with thoracolumbar spine trauma (TLST) treated according to the TLICS. METHODS: The TLICS was prospectively applied to a consecutive series of patients treated for TLST between 2009 and 2012. Patients with a TLICS of 4 points or more were surgically treated, whereas patients with a TLICS of 3 points or fewer were conservatively managed. The primary outcome was the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS). RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were treated. In 37 patients, the TLICS was 3 points or fewer and the patients were treated nonsurgically (Group 1). The remaining 28 patients with a TLICS of 4 or more points underwent surgical treatment (Group 2). In Group 1, 28 patients underwent some follow-up at the authors' institution; all of these patients were neurologically intact with compression or burst fractures (TLICS of 1 or 2 points; median 2). The average age in this group was 44.5 years, and follow-up ranged from 1 to 36 months (mean 6.7 months, median 3 months). Two patients (both with a TLICS of 2 points) underwent late surgery for axial back pain and mild focal kyphosis, without significant clinical improvement. In Group 2, follow-up ranged from 1 to 18 months (mean 4.4 months, median 3 months) and the TLICS ranged from 4 to 10 points (median 7 points). In this group, preoperatively, 9 (32{\%}) patients had AIS Grade E injuries, 6 (21{\%}) had AIS Grade C, 1 (4{\%}) had AIS Grade B, and 12 (43{\%}) had AIS Grade A injuries. At the final follow-up, the AIS grade was E in 11 patients (39{\%}), D in 5 (18{\%}), and A in 12 (43{\%}). No patient had neurological worsening during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The TLICS can be used to guide treatment that is safe with regard to the neurological status of patients treated for TLST.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An in-vitro study. PURPOSE: The current study is aimed at investigating the differences in stability between short posterior fixation (SPF), hybrid posterior fixation (HPF), and long posterior fixation (LPF) with and without anterior column augmentation using calcium phosphate bone cement (CaP) for treating burst fractures (BFs). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The ideal treatment for thoracolumbar BF is controversial regarding the use of short or LPF constructs. METHODS: Seven human thoracolumbar spines (T9-L4) were tested on a six degree of freedom spine simulator in three physiologic planes, flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). Tested surgical constructs included the following: intact, injury (BF), SPF (T12-L2), HPF (T11-L2), LPF (T11-L3), SPF+CaP, HPF+CaP, LPF+CaP, and CaP alone (CaP). Range of motion (ROM) was recorded at T12-L2 in FE, LB, and AR. RESULTS: THE REDUCTION IN MEAN ROM TRENDED AS FOLLOWS: LPF{\textgreater}HPF{\textgreater}SPF. Only LPF constructs and HPF with anterior column augmentation significantly reduced mean ROM in FE and LB compared to the intact state. All instrumented constructs (SPF, HPF, and LPF) significantly reduced ROM in FE and LB compared to the injured condition. Furthermore, the instrumented constructs did not provide significant rotational stability. Injecting CaP provided minimal additional stability. CONCLUSIONS: For the injury created, LPF and HPF provided better stability than SPF with and without anterior column augmentation. Therefore, highly unstable fractures may require extended, long or hybrid fusion constructs for optimum stability.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients underwent posterior short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar fractures in our institute from 2007 to 2010 were included in this retrospective study. Radiological evaluations were carried out by measuring regional kyphosis angle (RA), anterior vertebral body compression percentage (AVC), and sagittal index (SI) during preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up, with the aim to investigate the rate of correction loss and implantation failure in relation to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosythese(AO) classification of fracture system and the Load Sharing score system. CT scans were also used to determine the preoperative to postoperative canal compromise ratio. During the final follow-up, clinical outcomes were analysed based on scores from the Denis' Pain's and Work scales and neurological function was scored according to the Frankel classification. RESULTS: At the final follow-up (average duration of 15 months), 21 patients (95{\%}) who partially or fully recovered from thoracolumbar fractures were able to resume daily activities with no complaints of pain, or only slight pain. No deterioration in neurological function were recorded. Upon evaluation at each point of time, (preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up), the average RA improved from 21 masculine to 3.5 masculine to 5.6 masculine, average AVC improved from 40.8{\%} to 90.2{\%} to 88.2{\%}, and average SI changed from 19.1 masculine to 3.1 masculine to 4.1 masculine, respectively. Average canal compromise ratio decreased from 45{\%} to 6.7{\%} after surgery. No correlation was found between loss of correction and AO classification of fracture system, and loss of correction and Load Sharing system scores. Also, no correlation was found between clinical outcomes and the correction loss limited to 10 masculine. CONCLUSION: Posterior short-segment fixation in thoracolumbar fractures showed a satisfactory outcome in 95{\%} of the patients based on a 15-month follow-up in our institute, even among patients with comminuted fractures injuries.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) induces platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, and agents that inhibit TXA2 production or interaction with receptors may exert potential application in stroke therapy. AIM: To illustrate the platelet aggregation antagonistic and endothelial protective effect of (E) - 3 - (3 - methoxy - 4 - ((3, 5, 6 - trimethylpyrazin - 2 - yl) methoxy) phenyl) sodium acrylate (MC-002) through TXA2 inhibition and underline mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Platelets aggregation and thoracic aorta ring contraction of rabbits were induced by U46619. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were further applied to explore the protective effect of MC-002 on endothelium when exposed to tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha). MTT method was used to assess cell damage, and ELISA analysis was exerted to estimate nitrogen monoxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1alpha) releasing. Fluorescence spectrophotometry was conducted to determine intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), and western blotting method was applied to evaluate the protein expressions of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TXA2 analog U46619 mediated obvious platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. MC-002 inhibited platelet aggregation through administration in vivo and incubation with platelet in vitro, and relaxed aorta ring in endothelium dependent manner. MC-002 alleviated cell damage, [Ca(2+)]i overload, ET-1 overexcretion and TXB2 activation, but improved NO availability reduction in HUVECs treated with TNF-alpha. Furthermore, MC-002 downregulated ICAM-1, P-selectin and NF-kappaB overexpression induced by TNF-alpha. In conclusion, MC-002 exerted antiplatelet aggregation effect through TXA2 inhibition and relieved inflammatory injury of endothelial cells through NF-kappaB signal pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, Posterior Short Segment Pedicle Screw Fixation is a popular procedure for treating unstable thoracolumbar/lumbar burst fracture. But progressive kyphosis and a high rate of hardware failure because of lack of the anterior column support remains a concern. The efficacy of different methods remains debatable and each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with isolated thoracolumbar/lumbar burst fractures were treated by posterior short segment pedicle screw fixation and transforaminal thoracolumbar/lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) between January 2005 and December 2007. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Demographic data, neurologic status, anterior vertebral body heights, segmental Cobb angle and treatment-related complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean operative time was 167 minutes (range, 150-220). Blood loss was 450 {\~{}} 1200 ml, an average of 820 ml. All patients recovered with solid fusion of the intervertebral bone graft, without main complications like misplacement of the pedicle screw, nerve or vessel lesion or hard ware failure. The post-operative radiographs demonstrated a good fracture reduction and it was well maintained until the bone graft fusion. Neurological recovery of one to three Frankel grade was seen in 14 patients with partial neurological deficit, three grades of improvement was seen in one patient, two grades of improvement was observed in 6 patients and one grade of improvement was found in 6 patients. All the 6 patients with no paraplegia on admission remained neurological intact, and in one patient with Frankel D on admission no improvement was observed. CONCLUSION: Posterior short-segment pedicle fixation in conjunction with TLIF seems to be a feasible option in the management of selected thoracolumbar/lumbar burst fractures, thereby addressing all the three columns through a single approach with less trauma and good results.},

abstract = {About 75-90{\%} of patients with advanced metastatic cancer experience significant cancer pain. Bone cancer pain is one of the most common pains experienced by patients with advanced breast, prostate, or lung cancer. It is characterized by significant skeletal remodeling, fractures, pain, and anemia, all of which reduce the functional status, quality of life, and survival of the patient. Recent years have seen great progress toward alleviating bone pain with the identification of a range of chemicals as well as receptors modulating cancer pain progression. However, the complicated interactions among these factors and, sometimes, the contradicting effects of the same factor in different pathways make it difficult to spot individual effective targets. The sheer quantity of the chemicals involved and the limited understanding from animal models are the constraints in the development of effective therapies for cancer bone pain. In this review, key targets will be discussed along the pain transduction pathway, including peripheral pain sensation, spinal cord transduction pathway, and the central nervous system, to offer a logical and systematic study for the development of combined anti-bone pain treatments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are a leading cause of thoracic and lumbar (T and L) spine injuries. Mechanisms of injury in vehicular crashes that result in thoracic and lumbar fractures and the spectrum of injury in these occupants have not been extensively studied in the literature. PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate the patterns of T and L spine injuries after MVC; correlate these patterns with restraint use, crash characteristics, and demographic variables; and study the associations of these injuries with general injury morbidity and fatality. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The study design is a retrospective study of a prospectively gathered database. PATIENT SAMPLE: Six hundred thirty-one occupants with T and L (T1-L5) spine injuries from 4,572 occupants included in the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) database between 1996 and 2011 were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: No clinical outcome measures were evaluated in this study. METHODS: The CIREN database includes moderate to severely injured occupants from MVC involving vehicles manufactured recently. Demographic, injury, and crash data from each patient were analyzed for correlations between patterns of T and L spine injuries, associated extraspinal injuries and overall injury severity score (ISS), type and use of seat belts, and other crash characteristics. T and L spine injuries patterns were categorized using a modified Denis' classification to include extension injuries as a separate entity. RESULTS: T and L spine injuries were identified in 631 of 4,572 vehicle occupants, of whom 299 sustained major injuries (including 21 extension injuries) and 332 sustained minor injuries. Flexion-distraction injuries were more prevalent in children and young adults and extension injuries in older adults (mean age, 65.7 years). Occupants with extension injuries had a mean body mass index of 36.0 and a fatality rate of 23.8{\%}, much higher than the fatality rate for the entire cohort (10.9{\%}). The most frequent extraspinal injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale Grade 2 or more) associated with T and L spine injuries involved the chest (seen in 65.6{\%} of 631 occupants). In contrast to occupants with major T and L spine injuries, those with minor T and L spine injuries showed a strikingly greater association with pelvic and abdominal injuries. Occupants with minor T and L spine injuries had a higher mean ISS (27.1) than those with major T and L spine injuries (25.6). Among occupants wearing a three-point seat belt, 35.3{\%} sustained T and L spine injuries, whereas only 11.6{\%} of the unbelted occupants sustained T and L spine injuries. Three-point belted individuals were more likely to sustain burst fractures, whereas two-point belted occupants sustained flexion-distraction injuries most often and unbelted occupants had a predilection for fracture-dislocations of the T and L spines. Three-point seat belts were protective against neurologic injury, higher ISS, and fatality. CONCLUSIONS: T and L spine fracture patterns are influenced by the age of occupant and type and use of seat belts. Despite a reduction in overall injury severity and mortality, seat belt use is associated with an increased incidence of T and L spine fractures. Minor T and L spine fractures were associated with an increased likelihood of pelvic and abdominal injuries and higher ISSs, demonstrating their importance in predicting overall injury severity. Extension injuries occurred in older obese individuals and were associated with a high fatality rate. Future advancements in automobile safety engineering should address the need to reduce T and L spine injuries in belted occupants.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the combination involving percutaneous screw fixation and vertebroplasty in split fractures of thoracolumbar spine. METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten consecutive adult patients who had posttraumatic vertebral split fractures (Magerl A2) were prospectively treated by an interventional radiologist under computed tomography and fluoroscopy guidance. Using a bilateral route under local anesthesia, one 4.0-mm cannulated screw was placed on one side to fix the fracture, and on the other side, vertebroplasty was performed. Follow-up ranging from 12 to 24 months was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) RESULTS: Combined procedures were performed on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, creating both osteosynthesis and cement bridge between the displaced fragment and the rest of the vertebral body. Mean VAS measurements +/- standard deviation (SD) decreased from 7.5 +/- 1.5 preoperatively to 3.2 +/- 1.9 at 1 day, 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 1 month, and 1.9 +/- 1.4 at the last examination (P {\textless} 0.001). Mean ODI scores +/- SD decreased from 65.3 +/- 16.2, preoperatively, to 16.1 +/- 5.0 at the final examination (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that type A2 vertebral fractures could be successfully stabilized by the combination of percutaneous osteosynthesis and vertebroplasty.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiographical results. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The evolution of posterior approach for burst fractures was from long-segment to short-segment and then to monosegmental fixation. Decompression of the spinal cord is performed by anterior or posterior approaches. The technique attempts to decompress the spinal cord by a paramedian subpedicle approach, and simultaneous vertebral reconstruction with pile-up titanium spacers (subpedicle decompression and body augmentation [SpBA]) was developed. METHODS: Eighty patients with symptomatic single thoracolumbar Magerl incomplete burst fractures were included. After manual reduction, transpedicle body augmentation and shortsegment fixation (TpBA group) were performed in 38 patients and SpBA in 42 cases. The mean follow-up was 52.6 +/- 18.7 (TpBA) and 42.1 +/- 7.8 (SpBA) months, and the age was 57.9 +/- 7.2 and 59.1 +/- 8.3 years. Clinical and radiographical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The operation time was 66 +/- 11 (TpBA) versus 34.5 +/- 5.5 (SpBA) minutes. The initial anterior vertebral correction was 46.8 +/- 12.2{\%} (TpBA) versus 53.2 +/- 15.0{\%} (SpBA) (P = 0.03) and the final correction was 44.0 +/- 10.8{\%} versus 51.5 +/- 15.3{\%} (P = 0.01). Initial corrections of the lateral Cobb angle were 22.3 degrees +/- 2.6 degrees versus 22.8 degrees +/- 2.7 degrees and the final corrections were 19.1 degrees +/- 3.4 degrees versus 20.5 degrees +/- 2.9 degrees . The VAS score was 7.7 +/- 1.2 versus 7.9 +/- 1.2 preoperatively and 2.2 +/- 0.7 versus 1.8 +/- 0.6 (P = 0.02) at the final visit. Seventy-five patients maintained or recovered to Frankel grade E. Three patients in the TpBA group and 2 in the SpBA group improved from grade C to D. Technical complications included 1 root overstretch in the SpBA group and one incomplete decompression in the TpBA group. CONCLUSION: SpBA is a safe and fast technique to treat Magerl incomplete burst fractures and leads to good clinical results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posterior ligamentous complex injuries of the thoracolumbar (TL) spine represent a major consideration during surgical decision-making. However, X-ray and computed tomography imaging often does not identify those injuries and sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available or is contraindicated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound for detecting posterior ligamentous complex injuries in the TL spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was carried out through four international databases and proceedings of scientific meetings. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated, by using weighted averages according to the sample size of each study. Summary receiver operating characteristic was also estimated. RESULTS: A total of four articles were included in the meta-analysis, yielding a summary estimate: Sensitivity, 0.89 (95{\%} CI, 0.86-0.92); specificity, 1.00 (95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.00); positive likelihood ratio, 224.49 (95{\%} CI, 30.43-1656.26); negative likelihood ratio, 0.11 (95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.19); and diagnostic odds ratio, 2,268.13 (95{\%} CI, 265.84-19,351.24). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity among results of included studies. SUMMARY: Receiver operating characteristic (+/-standard error) was 0.928 +/- 0.047. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The present meta-analysis showed that ultrasound has a high accuracy for diagnosing posterior ligamentous complex injuries in patients with flexion distraction, compression, or burst TL fractures. On the basis of present results, ultrasound may be considered as a useful alternative when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unavailable or contraindicated, or when its results are inconclusive.},

abstract = {AIM: Burst fractures without neurological deficit are often treated successfully  without surgery. A subgroup may fail non-operative treatment owing to pain, and opt for surgery. The following review was conducted to identify predictors of success or failure in the non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients with T11-L4 thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated non-operatively, with bed rest and bracing until the pain abated sufficiently to allow mobilization. Patients were followed prospectively for a mean +/- SD of 12 +/- 14 months, and their data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients successfully completed non-operative treatment. Owing to intractable pain in nine, surgery was undertaken. Ages in the non-operative and operative groups were 46 +/- 18 and 68 +/- 15 years respectively (p = 0.002). The residual canal and angulation at the site of the fracture were 63 +/- 12{\%} and 1.6 +/- 8.4 degrees in the non-operative group and 47 +/- 15{\%} and 6.6 +/- 13.6 degrees in the surgical group (p = 0.001 and 0.149 between groups, respectively). Regression analysis of age, gender, angulation, and residual canal showed that only age (OR, 1.099; 95{\%} CI, 1.022-1.183; p = 0.011) and residual canal (OR, 0.795; 95{\%} CI, 0.642-0.985; p = 0.035) were significant predictors of failure, ultimately undergoing surgery. CONCLUSION: Non-surgical treatment was more likely to prove sufficient in patients aged 46 +/- 18 years, and residual canal of 63 +/- 12{\%}, than in older patients with ages of 68 +/- 15, and canal of 47 +/- 15{\%}. The latter group was more likely to fail, undergoing surgery because of pain or instability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treating traumatic fractures in osteoporosis is challenging. Multiple clinical treatment options are found in literature. Augmentation techniques are promising to reduce treatment-related morbidity. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of reports about extended indication for augmentation techniques. However, biomechanical evaluations of these techniques are limited. METHODS: Nine thoracolumbar osteoporotic spinal samples (4 FSU) were harvested from postmortem donors and immediately frozen. Biomechanical testing was performed by a robotic-based spine tester. Standardized incomplete burst fractures were created by a combination of osteotomy-like weakening and high velocity compression using a hydraulic material testing apparatus. Biomechanical measurements were performed on specimens in the following conditions: 1) intact, 2) fractured, 3) bisegmental instrumented, 4) bisegmental instrumented with vertebroplasty (hybrid augmentation, HA) and 5) stand-alone vertebroplasty (VP). The range of motion (RoM), neutral zone (NZ), elastic zone (EZ) and stiffness parameters were determined. Statistical evaluation was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Significant increases in RoM and in the NZ and EZ (p {\textless} 0.005) were observed after fracture production. The RoM was decreased significantly by applying the dorsal bisegmental instrumentation to the fractured specimens (p {\textless} 0.005). VP reduced fractured RoM in flexion but was still increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) above intact kinematic values. NZ stiffness (p {\textless} 0.05) and EZ stiffness (p {\textless} 0.01) was increased by VP but remained lower than prefracture values. The combination of short segment instrumentation and vertebroplasty (HA) showed no significant changes in RoM and stiffness in NZ in comparison to the instrumented group, except for significant increase of EZ stiffness in flexion (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Stand-alone vertebroplasty (VP) showed some degree of support of the anterior column but was accompanied by persistent traumatic instability. Therefore, we would advocate against using VP as a stand-alone procedure in traumatic fractures. HA did not increase primary stability of short segment instrumentation. Some additional support of anterior column and changes of kinematic values of the EZ may lead one to suppose that additive augmentation may reduce the load of dorsal implants and possibly reduce the risk of implant failure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are very few data concerning the outcome after short-segment posterior stabilization and anterior spondylodesis with rib grafts in patients suffering from unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. We have therefore investigated the clinical and radiographic outcome after posterior bisegmental instrumentation and monosegmental anterior spondylodesis using an autologous rib graft for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 32 consecutive patients at a single center. The monosegmental Cobb angle was measured preoperatively, postoperatively, then 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and also after implant removal. Anterior vertebral fusion was graded on conventional radiographs according to the criteria proposed by Molinari. RESULTS: Segmental kyphosis at the fracture site was corrected from a median of -20 degrees (95{\%} CI: -21.2 to -18.8) to -1.0 degrees (95{\%} CI: -2.7 to 0.7) postoperatively. 1 year after surgery, the segmental angle had decreased by a median of 2.0 degrees (95{\%} CI: 0.2 to 2.8). The spondylodesis fused in all patients, which was evident from incorporation and remodeling of the rib grafts. The median correction loss after implant removal was 0.0 degrees (95{\%} CI: -0.5 to 0.5). 26 of the 32 patients reported having no back complaints at the last follow-up (2 years postoperatively). 1 patient suffered from intercostal neuralgia, and 5 patients reported mild to moderate back pain. INTERPRETATION: Short-segment posterior instrumentation and anterior spondylodesis using an autologous rib graft resulted in sufficient correction of posttraumatic segmental kyphosis. There was no clinically relevant correction loss, and the majority of patients had no back complaints at the 2-year follow-up.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which von Willebrand factor (VWF) achieves hemostasis lie in its structure. Whereas low-molecular-weight forms have diminished hemostatic potential, ultralarge VWF (ULVWF) in excess is potentially thrombogenic. VWF comprises many subunits, which themselves comprise many repeated domains/assemblies possessing characteristic function(s). Organization of these domains/assemblies into a multimeric structure effectively links and replicates these functions. Each domain/assembly influences the synthesis, assembly, secretion, or hemostatic potential of plasma VWF. The C-terminal CT/CK domain mediates dimerization of VWF subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the N-terminal D1D2 assemblies catalyzes disulfide binding between juxtaposed D3 assemblies in the trans-Golgi, creating multimers. The pH-sensitive domains (A2-CT/CK) allow ULVWF multimers to orderly pack into tubules that unravel upon secretion into the circulation. Hemodynamic forces regulate the conformation of the A2 domain and thus, its accessibility to proteolytic enzyme(s) that regulate VWF's hemostatic potential. Binding to the VWF D'D3 assemblies stabilizes coagulation factor VIII. The VWF A1 and A3 domains facilitate platelet capture onto exposed collagen(s) at sites of vascular injury. Our deeper understanding of VWF provided through the recent growth in VWF structure-function studies may potentially guide novel therapeutics for clotting or bleeding disorders.},

abstract = {Spinal injuries are generally very rare in childhood. Fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine occur mainly in older children and adolescents. Exact knowledge of the anatomy is essential for accurate diagnosis in still incomplete ossification. With increasing age the classification can be performed by using the AO classification over the age of 8 years. Neurological symptoms in the thoracic and lumbar spine occur mainly in adolescence. Conventional radiography is the standard diagnostic tool for thoracic and lumbar spinal injuries. With the appearance of abnormal neurological deficits magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostics should also be performed and for operative cases computed tomography (CT) scans are mandatory. The most common fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine are compression fractures (type A) which can generally be treated conservatively due to the stable situation but unstable fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine (types B and C) are stabilized dorsally (internal fixation). Ventral stabilization with vertebral body replacement is occasionally necessary in adolescents. Spinal injuries in children have a good overall prognosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The natural history of cervical spine lesions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is variable. We have actively performed occipito-thoracic fusion for severe destructive rheumatoid cervical disorders and reported its clinical results and complications. In our previous study, the most frequent complication was the adjacent-level failures caused by the fragile spine. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for adjacent-level failures after occipito-thoracic fusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 35 RA patients (31 females and 4 males) who underwent occipito-thoracic fusion using RRS Loop Spinal System((R)) (Robert Reid Inc. Tokyo, Japan), and the incidence and characteristics of adjacent-level failures were investigated. Furthermore, the adjacent-level failures were divided into two types according to their levels, fracture at the lowest level of the fusion area and that at the level inferior to the fusion area, and the characteristics of each type were evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Nine (26{\%}) of 35 patients suffered adjacent-level failures (10 vertebral fractures). Adjacent-level failures occurred when the distance of fixation was "O-T4" or longer. The long fusion might cause adjacent-level failures due to greater mechanical stress. Seven fractures occurred at the lowest level of the fusion area, and all of them were cured without symptoms by conservative treatment. Three fractures occurred at the level inferior to the fusion area, and one of them needed additional surgery due to sudden paraplegia resulting from collapse of the adjacent vertebra. After occipito-thoracic fusion, burst fractures at the level inferior to the fusion area might cause sudden paraplegia, and therefore a careful observation should be required for patients with these fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Traumatic fractures of the spine are most common at the thoracolumbar junction and can be a source of great disability. PURPOSE: To review the most current information regarding the pathophysiology, injury pattern, treatment options, and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Relevant articles, textbook chapters, and abstracts covering thoracolumbar spine fractures with and without neurologic deficit from 1960 to the present were reviewed. RESULTS: The thoracolumbar spine represents a unique system from a skeletal as well as neurological standpoint. The rigid rib-bearing thoracic spine articulates with the more mobile lumbar spine at the thoracolumbar junction (T10 - L2), the site of most fractures. A complete examination includes a careful neurologic examination of both motor and sensory systems. CT scans best describe bony detail while MRI is most efficient at describing soft tissues and neurological structures. The most recent classification system is that of the new Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score. The different fracture types include compression fractures, burst fractures - both stable and unstable -, flexion-distraction injuries and fracture dislocations. Their treatment, both operative and non-operative depends on the degree of bony compromise, neurological involvement, and the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. Minimally invasive approaches to the care of thoracolumbar injuries have become more popular, thus, the evidence regarding their efficacy is presented. Finally, the treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine is reviewed, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, their risks and controversies, and senile burst fractures, as well. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracolumbar spine fractures remain a significant source of potential morbidity. Advances in treatment have minimized the invasiveness of our surgery and in certain stable situations, eliminated it all together.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with reduced bone mineral content and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Reduced peak bone mass might explain the low bone mineral density (BMD) among patients with childhood onset GHD (CO-GHD) whilst the cause of osteopenia in adult-onset GHD (AO-GHD) is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: Prospective multicentric study to asses bone status in GHD adults after two years of recombinant growth hormone replacement treatment. METHODS: In 94 GHD adults (49 men; O 34.5 yrs) we have measured BMD and bone markers (CTX, osteocalcin) during two years of rhGH treatment (at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and after 1 and 2 years). Patients were adequately substituted for GHD and other pituitary deficiencies. RESULTS: We have observed an increase in BMD-lumbar spine: n=42, 0.8155 --{\textgreater}0.9418 g/cm2, p{\textless}0.0001; femoral neck n=41; 0.8468 --{\textgreater}0.9031; p= 0.0004; BMD-whole body 1.0179 --{\textgreater}1.0774; p=0.0003. We have compared gender difference: BMD-L-spine by 15.8 {\%} in men (n=21) and by 5.6 {\%} in women (n=19) (p= 0.008); BMD-femoral neck increased by 11.03 {\%} in men and by about 3.0 {\%} in women (p=0.032). In women, the initial decrease in BMD was recorded after 3 months. CO-GHD adults yielded a higher increase in BMD -L-spine (16.6 {\%}, p=0.022). A correlation exists between IGF-I levels and BMD in lumbar spine (1st year: R=0.348, p=0.026; 2nd year: R= 0.33, p=0.0081) and between IGF-I and osteocalcin (1st year: R=0.383; p=0.0038). CONCLUSION: Two-year therapy with recombinant human growth hormone improved bone status. IGF-I appears to be a good indicator of rhGH effect on bone (Tab. 3, Fig. 9, Ref. 36).

abstract = {Thoracolumbar spine trauma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Special attention to this population is necessary because several unique features of the growing pediatric spine separate these patients from adult patients. These injuries are frequently associated with high-energy trauma and concurrent thoracic or abdominal injuries that require coordinated multidisciplinary care. Thoracolumbar spine trauma in pediatric patients may lead to compression fractures, burst fractures, flexion-distraction injuries (ie, Chance fracture), fracture-dislocation injuries, apophyseal fractures/herniations, and spinous process and transverse process fractures. Depending on the nature of the injury and the patient's level of skeletal maturity, thoracolumbar spinal injuries may have substantial ability to heal and remodel. Because the impact of thoracolumbar spinal injury on pediatric patients can be devastating, appropriate early diagnosis and management, as well as long-term follow-up, are imperative.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Thoracolumbar burst fractures have good outcomes when treated with early ambulation and orthosis (TLSO). If equally good outcomes could be achieved with early ambulation and no brace, resource utilization would be decreased, especially in developing countries where prolonged bed rest is the default option because bracing is not available or affordable. PURPOSE: To determine whether TLSO is equivalent to no orthosis (NO) in the treatment of acute AO Type A3 thoracolumbar burst fractures with respect to their functional outcome at 3 months. STUDY DESIGN: A multicentre, randomized, nonblinded equivalence trial involving three Canadian tertiary spine centers. Enrollment began in 2002 and 2-year follow-up was completed in 2011. PATIENT SAMPLE: Inclusion criteria included AO-A3 burst fractures between T11 and L3, skeletally mature and older than 60 years, 72 hours from their injury, kyphotic deformity lower than 35 degrees , no neurologic deficit. One hundred ten patients were assessed for eligibility for the study; 14 patients were not recruited because they resided outside the country (3), refused participation (8), or were not consented before independent ambulation (3). OUTCOME MEASURES: Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score (RMDQ) assessed at 3 months postinjury. The equivalence margin was set at delta=5 points. METHODS: The NO group was encouraged to ambulate immediately with bending restrictions for 8 weeks. The TLSO group ambulated when the brace was available and weaned from the brace after 8 to 10 weeks. The following competitive grants supported this work: VHHSC Interdisciplinary Research Grant, Zimmer/University of British Columbia Research Fund, and Hip Hip Hooray Research Grant. Aspen Medical provided the TLSOs used in this study. The authors have no financial or personal relationships that could inappropriately influence this work. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled into the TLSO group and 49 patients into the NO group. Forty-six participants per group were available for the primary outcome. The RMDQ score at 3 months postinjury was 6.8 +/- 5.4 (standard deviation [SD]) for the TLSO group and 7.7 +/- 6.0 (SD) in the NO group. The 95{\%} confidence interval (-1.5 to 3.2) was within the predetermined margin of equivalence. Six patients required surgical stabilization, five of them before initial discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Treating these fractures using early ambulation without a brace avoids the cost and patient deconditioning associated with a brace and complications and costs associated with long-term bed rest if a TLSO or body cast is not available.},

Twenty consecutive young adults aged 45 +/- 11 years with fresh burst A3/AO or severely compressed A2/AO fractures underwent via a less invasive posterior approach one-staged reduction with a novel augmentation implant and PMMA plus 3-vertebrae pedicle screw fixation and fusion. Radiologic parameters as segmental kyphosis (SKA), anterior (AVBHr) and posterior vertebral body height ratio (PVBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), cement leakage and functional parameters as VAS, SF-36 were measured pre- and post-operatively. Hybrid construct restored AVBHr (P {\textless} 0.000), PVBHr (P = 0.02), SKA (P = 0.015), SCE (P = 0.002) without loss of correction at an average follow-up of 17 months. PMMA leakage occurred in 3 patients (3 vertebrae) either anteriorly to the fractured vertebral body or to the adjacent disc, but in no case to the spinal canal. Two pedicle screws were malpositioned (one medially, one laterally to the pedicle at the fracture level) without neurologic sequelae. Solid posterolateral spinal fusion occurred 8-10 months post-operatively. Pre-operative VAS and SF-36 scores improved post-operatively significantly. This study showed that this novel vertebral augmentation technique using PEEK implant and PMMA reduces and stabilizes via less invasive technique A2 and A3 vertebral fractures without loss of correction and leakage to the spinal canal.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the curative effect of short-segment transpedicular fixation plus vertebra fracture fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with osteoporosis. METHODS: The clinical data of thoracolumbar burst fractures in 46 patients with osteoporosis, single segment fracture and neurological intactness were analyzed retrospectively from January 2008 to January 2012. There were 20 males and 26 females with a mean age of 64.5 (56-78) years. The mechanisms of injury were fall (n = 20), traffic accident (n = 12), high falling injury (n = 8) and heavy pound injury (n = 4). The involved vertebrae included T11 (n = 5); T12 (n = 17); L1 (n = 21); L2 (n = 3). Pedicle screw was inserted into injured vertebra and the height of collapsed vertebra fractures reduced with position and instrument. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and short form-36 scoring systems were used to evaluate pain level and quality of life. The height restoration and kyphotic correction rates of fracture level were measured radiologically. RESULTS: All patients underwent surgery safely without severe complications. The average follow-up period was 20.5 (9-48) months. There was significant difference (t = 20.057, P = 0.000; t = 24.287, P = 0.000) in VAS score between last follow-up (3.09 +/- 1.01) and post-operation (2.35 +/- 1.02) versus pre-operation (7.22 +/- 1.05) respectively. And also there was significant difference (P {\textless} 0.05) in SF-36 score between last follow-up (126.5 +/- 22.3) and post-operation (96.7 +/- 17.5). The Cobb angle was corrected to (5.6 +/- 1.9) degrees of post-operation and (7.8 +/- 3.3) degrees of last follow-up. The loss rate of vertebral was (4.8 +/- 5.2){\%} of post-operation and (7.6 +/- 2.9) {\%} of last follow-up. There was no loosening or breakage of internal fixations. CONCLUSIONS: The approach of short-segment transpedicular fixation plus vertebra fracture fixation is both safe and effective to maintain reduction and reduce the rate of correction loss and instrument failure.},

METHODS: Twenty patients with Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures underwent anterior decompression with single segmental spinal Interbody fusion. They underwent clinical and radiologic follow-up for at least three years after the surgery. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period lasted 57 months. To the last follow-up, there were no cases of internal fixation loosening, failure and other complications. Titanium mesh or interbody bone grafts were in good position. Spinal kyphosis was not observed. Interbody fusion was achieved for all cases. The average fusion time was 4.5 months. Based on visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, percentage of vertebral body height loss and Cobb angle, the difference was statistically significant between the preoperative period and postoperative one year or final follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05). Results at postoperative one year and final follow-up were better than the preoperative period. However, the difference was not significant between postoperative one year and final follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of vertebral split fractures remains controversial, consisting of either corset or internal fixation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of CT- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of vertebral split fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Sixty-two consecutive adult patients who had post-traumatic vertebral split fractures (A2 according to the AO classification) without neurological symptoms were prospectively treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. All these procedures were performed by an interventional radiologist under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy guidance by using only local anaesthesia. Postoperative outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty was performed on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, creating a cement bridge between the displaced fragment and the rest of the vertebral body. Seven discal cement leakages (11{\%}) were observed, without occurrence of adjacent vertebral compression fractures. The mean VAS measurements +/- standard deviation (SD) significantly decreased from 7.9 +/- 1.5 preoperatively to 3.3 +/- 2.1 at 1 day, 2.2 +/- 2.0 at 1 month, and 1.8 +/- 1.4 at 6 months (P{\textless}0.001). The mean ODI scores +/- SD had also a significant improvement: 62.3 +/- 17.2 preoperatively and 15.1 +/- 6.0 at the 6-month follow-up (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that type A2 vertebral fractures could be successfully treated by CT- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To discuss when and how to operate on thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 77 consecutive patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures treated from 2000 to 2011; 28 patients experienced high-energy spinal trauma and 49 low-energy spinal trauma. Mean follow-up was 5 years (1-11 years). Surgical treatment was done in 15 patients with neurological deficits, and in 16 neurologically intact patients with fractures-dislocations, burst fractures and fractures with marked deformity. Non-surgical treatment was done in 46 neurologically intact patients with simple fracture configurations. Clinical and imaging examination and the Oswestry Disability Index (O.D.I.) questionnaire were obtained. RESULTS: All patients treated surgically maintained spinal alignment; patients with long fusion maintained the best alignment; however, they experienced back stiffness and moderate low back pain. Patients with combined posterior fusion and kyphoplasty experienced earlier recovery and improved sagittal correction. Mean O.D.I. was 22.4 and 14.2{\%} at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Thirty six (78{\%}) patients treated non-surgically were asymptomatic, 22 (48{\%}) experienced mild residual kyphosis, 10 (22 {\%}) developed marked deformity during their follow-up and were finally operated; mean O.D.I. was 28.6 and 12.1{\%} at 3 and 12 months. No difference in O.D.I. was observed between patients who had surgical and non-surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive neurological deficits and/or mechanical instability of the spine are absolute indications for early surgical treatment. Younger patients with high-energy spinal trauma, unstable fractures and neurological deficits should be treated surgically in order to provide optimum conditions for neurologic recovery, early mobilization and possibly ambulation. Most cases can be adequately operated through a posterior only surgical approach; an anterior or combined approach is usually indicated for burst and thoracic spine fractures. Postoperative complications, more common infection and neurological deterioration may occur. Elderly, neurologically intact patients with low-energy, stable spinal fractures without marked spinal deformity may be successfully treated conservatively. Most of these patients will do well; however, follow-up for progressive posttraumatic deformity is required.},

Between February 2004 and December 2008, 138 patients with TBF were divided into group A (108 cases) and group B (30 cases). In group A, under the assistance of real-time B-mode ultrasound, posterior decompression and fracture piece reduction were performed, and we observed the signal changes in spinal cord blood flow. In group B, posterior fenestration was combined with pushing the fracture piece into the fractured vertebral body using an L-shaped operative tool. Presurgical and postsurgical recovery of neurological function was evaluated according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards, and the range of spinal decompression was determined by measuring the proportion of encroached fracture piece in the spinal canal (spinal stenosis rate) on the computed tomography (CT) image. In group A, 12 patients had a grade A spinal injury according to the Frankel grading system, and there were six cases without neurological recovery. In the other patients, neurological function increased by 1-3 grades. There were no aggravated spinal cord injuries or other serious complications. In group B, three patients were categorized as grade A and there were two cases without neurological recovery. In the other patients, neurological function increased by 1-3 grades. In groups A and B, the postsurgical spinal stenosis rate was significantly lower than the presurgical stenosis rate (P{\textless}0.05). The postsurgical spinal stenosis rate in group B was significantly higher compared with group A (P{\textless}0.05). There was no significant difference in neurological function recovery between the groups (P{\textgreater}0.05).

METHODS: From March 2009 to February 2012,56 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated by transpedicular bone graft through Wiltse approach. Among them, there were 36 males and 20 females, ranging in age from 14 to 55 years old (mean, 41 years old). The time from injury to operation from 2 to 15 d (mean,3 d). Twenty-five cases were caused by falling down, 7 cases were caused by slipping, 20 cases were caused by car accident and 4 cases were caused by crush trauma. MRI was performed before operation to exclude pathological fracture. The distance between multifidus muscle and longissimus to midcourt line was measured. Self-made trocar was applied in operation. According to AO classification,there were 33 cases with type A1 compression fracture,5 cases with type A2 cleavage fracture and 18 cases with type A3 burst fracture. Sixteen cases of the 56 cases combined with spinal cord injury. Based on Frankel neurologic grading system, preoperative neurological function was grade B in 5 cases, grade C in 2 cases, gade D in 9 cases. Preoperative Denis gading were P5. Frankel and lumbago Denis clssification were used to evaluate neurological function and lumbago. The imaging data before, after operation and the latest follow-up were used to evaluate correction vision. RESULTS: All patients were followed up over 24 months. At the time of the latest follow-up, Frankel B were 3 cases, Frankel C were 2 cases, Frankel D were 4 cases and Frankel E were 7 cases. According to lumbago Denis clssification, P1 (painlessness) were 32 cases, P2 ( slight pain without treatment) were 18 cases, P3 ( moderate pain and taking medicine occasionally) were 6 cases. The anterior vertebral height improved from preoperative (13.38 +/- 4.72)mm to postoperative (22.18 +/- 1.44)mm. The Cobb's angle decreased from preoperative (28.39 +/- 2.64) degrees to (10.07 +/- 3.05) degrees. There were no nails broken, rod broken, internal fixation lossen and vertebral body recompression.

abstract = {Acute thoracolumbar fractures are commonly diagnosed by clinical symptoms and X-ray plain films. Computed tomography (CT) is used to assess vertebral body damage, posterior wall canal intrusion, and posterior column injury. Both of these imaging tools have helped to develop classifications systems that aid the clinician in differentiating stable versus unstable spinal injuries. Multidetector CT has become the standard of care in polytrauma patients. It provides superior evaluation of bony anatomy and has been reported to be more cost effective than X-ray plain films, particularly in the cervicothoracic junction and in thoracolumbar unstable burst fractures. One disadvantage might be the increase in radiation exposure. Another important limitation remains the inability to provide adequate assessment for ligamentous injury and spinal cord lesions. Disc and ligaments play an important role in fracture stability because the failure of the posterior tension band may lead to progressive kyphosis. The integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex has been included in recent fracture classification systems and treatment algorithms. MR imaging becomes essential for soft tissue injury assessment, especially when including T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression. MRI can now be considered key to accurate fracture classification, detection of occult and distant injuries, and as the basis for therapeutic decision making. It is therefore strongly recommended in the early assessment of spine trauma patients.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (TLICS) has been recently described to help surgeons in the decision-making process of thoracolumbar spinal trauma. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the potential relationships between the TLICS scores with the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) Spine System and patient's neurological status. METHODS: Literature analysis of the potential scored injuries in the TLICS system, based on its individual scores, its total score, and its suggested proposed treatment, correlating these with the AO system and neurological status. RESULTS: Findings are presented according to the TLICS score. Patients with a TLICS 1-3 points, receiving conservative treatment, are AO type A injuries, generally neurologically intact. TLICS 4 group also included AO type A fractures, neurologically ranging from intact to complete spinal cord injury. TLICS 5-10 points includes AO type B and C injuries, regarding their neurological status, and burst fractures (AO type A) with concomitant neurological injury and most of the patients with incomplete deficits and cauda equina syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: As a general overview, according to the TLICS, patients without neurological deficit and with AO type A injuries are conservatively treated. AO type B and C injuries are managed surgically, with regard to neurological status. Patients with cauda equina or incomplete injuries also received a higher severity score. Controversies still exist regarding the management of unstable burst fractures without neurological status. The role of the posterior ligamentous complex status and the magnetic resonance imaging in the decision-making process require more clinical evidence.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) was proposed to improve injury classification and guide surgical decision-making of thoracolumbar spinal trauma (TLST), but its impact on the care of patients has not been quantified. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Analysis of 458 patients treated for TLST trauma from 2000 through 2010 at a single center. Outcome measures Neurological status - ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), failure of conservative treatment, and surgical complications. METHODS: Clinical and radiological data were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to the period before (2000-2006) and after (2007-2010) utilization of the TLICS. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2006, 148 patients were initially treated conservatively (C) and 66 were surgically (S) treated. In the C group, the TLICS ranged from 1 to 7 (median 1; mean 1.57). In the S group, the TLICS ranged from 2 to 10 (median 2; mean 4.14). The TLICS matched treatment in 97.9{\%} of conservatively treated patients. From 2007 to 2010, 162 patients were initially treated C and 82 were treated S. In the C group, the TLICS ranged from 1 to 4 (median 1; mean 1.48). In the S group, the TLICS ranged from 2-10 (median 4; mean 4.4). The TLICS matched treatment in 98.8{\%} of C-treated patients. Overall, failure of C treatment occurred in nine patients; most failures (7/9) and all three missed distractive injuries occurred prior to use of the TLICS. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of the TLICS, there was a trend towards more successful conservative treatment with fewer conversions to surgical treatment.},

abstract = {Lipoxins and resolvins have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions and accumulating evidence indicates that these lipid mediators also attenuate pain-like behavior in a number of experimental models of inflammation and tissue injury-induced pain. The present study was undertaken to assess if spinal administration of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) or 17 (R)-resolvin D1 (17(R)-RvD1) attenuates mechanical hypersensitivity in the carrageenan model of peripheral inflammation in the rat. Given the emerging role of spinal cytokines in the generation and maintenance of inflammatory pain we measured cytokine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after LXA4 or 17(R)-RvD1 administration, and the ability of these lipid metabolites to prevent stimuli-induced release of cytokines from cultured primary spinal astrocytes. We found that intrathecal bolus injection of LXA4 and17(R)-RvD1 attenuated inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity without reducing the local inflammation. Furthermore, both LXA4 and 17(R)-RvD1 reduced carrageenan-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in the CSF, while only 17(R)-RvD1attenuated LPS and IFN-gamma-induced TNF release in astrocyte cell culture. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that lipoxins and resolvins potently suppress inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, possibly by attenuating cytokine release from spinal astrocytes. The inhibitory effect of lipoxins and resolvins on spinal nociceptive processing puts them in an intriguing position in the search for novel pain therapeutics.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective CT analysis of anterior fusion in thoracolumbar trauma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare fusion rates of different bone grafts and to analyze risk factors for pseudarthrosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Interbody fusion is indicated in anterior column defects. Different grafts are used: autologous iliac crest, titanium mesh cages filled with cancellous bone, and autologous ribs. It is not clear which graft offers the most reliable fusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiologic data of 116 patients (71 men, 45 women) operated for type A2, A3, B, or C fractures were analyzed. The average age was 44.6 years (range, 16-75 y) and follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 1-9 y). All patients were treated by posterior instrumentation followed by an anterior graft: 53 cases with iliac crest, 43 cases with mesh cages, and 20 with rib grafts. Fusion was evaluated on CT and classified into complete fusion, partial fusion, unipolar pseudarthrosis, and bipolar pseudarthrosis. RESULTS: Iliac crest fused in 66{\%}, cages in 98{\%}, and rib grafts in 90{\%}. The fusion rate of cages filled with bone was significantly higher as the iliac graft fusion rate (P=0.002). The same was applied to rib grafts compared with iliac crest (P=0.041). Additional bone formation around the main graft, bridging both vertebral bodies, was observed in 31 of the 53 iliac crests grafts. Pseudarthrosis occurred more often in smokers (P=0.042). A relationship between fracture or instrumentation types, sex, age, BMI, and fusion could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Tricortical iliac crest grafts showed an unexpected high pseudarthrosis rate in thoracolumbar injuries. Their cortical bone is dense and their fusion surface is small. Rib grafts led to a better fusion when used in combination with the cancellous bone from the fractured vertebral body. Titanium mesh cages filled with cancellous bone led to the highest fusion rate and built a complete bony bridge between vertebral bodies. Smoking seemed to influence fusion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case control study, Level III.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effectiveness of anterolateral decompression and three  column reconstruction through posterior approach for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fracture. METHODS: Between March 2009 and October 2011, 39 patients with unstable burst thoracolumbar fracture were treated. Of them, there were 32 males and 7 females, with an average age of 43.8 years (range, 25-68 years). The injury causes included falling from height in 17 cases, bruise in 10 cases, traffic accident in 4 cases, and other in 8 cases. The fracture was located at the T10 level in 1 case, T11 in 9 cases, T12 in 6 cases, L1 in 14 cases, L2 in 7 cases, L3 in 1 case, and L4 in 1 case. According to Frankel classification before operation, 5 cases were classified as grade A, 5 as grade B, 9 as grade C, 14 as grade D, and 6 as grade E. Before operation, the vertebral kyphosis Cobb angle was (26.7 +/- 7.1) degrees; vertebral height loss was 37.5{\%} +/- 9.5{\%}; and the space occupying of vertebral canal was 73.7{\%} +/- 11.3{\%}. The time between injury and operation was 1-4 days (mean, 2.5 days). All patients underwent anterolateral decompression of spinal canal by posterior approach and three column reconstruction. After operation, the vertebral height restoration, correction of kyphosis, decompression of the spinal canal, and the recovery of nerve function were evaluated. RESULTS: Increase of paraplegic level, urinary infection, and pressure sore occurred in 1 case, 1 case, and 2 cases, respectively; no incision infection or neurological complications was observed in the other cases, primary healing of incision was obtained. The patients were followed up 12-36 months (mean, 27 months). The patients had no aggravation of pain of low back after operation; no loosening and breaking of screws and rods occurred; no titanium alloys electrolysis and titanium cage subsidence or breakage was observed. The imaging examination showed that complete decompression of the spinal canal, satisfactory restoration of the vertebral height, and good physiological curvature of spine at 2 years after operation. At last follow-up, 1 case was classified as Frankel grade A, 2 as grade B, 2 as grade C, 10 as grade D, and 24 as grade E, which was significantly improved when compared with preoperative one (P{\textless} 0.05). At immediate after operation and last follow-up, the Cobb angle was (6.3 +/- 2.1) degrees and (6.5 +/- 2.4) degrees respectively; the vertebral height loss was 7.9{\%} +/- 2.7{\%} and 8.2{\%} +/- 3.0{\%} respectively; and the indexes were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The technique of anterolateral decompression and three column reconstruction through posterior approach is one perfect approach to treat unstable thoracolumbar fracture because of complete spinal cord canal decompression, three column reconstruction, and immediate recovery of the spinal stability after operation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The authors describe their first experience with virtually navigated pelvic and spine screws based on perioperative CT navigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 22 October 2012 (launching the device) to 9 January 2013, a total of 15 CT-navigated pelvic and spine operations were performed in 14 patients. Nerve root compression, scoliosis, vertebral fracture and spondylodiscitis were the indications for spine procedures; B-type and C-type fractures according to the AO classification were the indications in pelvic surgical procedures. The preparation and the course of the procedures were in accordance with current standards and recommendations in all the cases. Perioperative navigation and subsequent examination of the screw trajectory were performed via O-arm imaging system (Medtronic Navigation, Louisville, Colorado) instead of the standard C-arm fluoroscopy. RESULTS: A total of 73 screws were inserted (60 transpedicular screws into cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, 9 iliosacral screws into the first sacral vertebra and 4 pubic screws). Only one of the pubic screws (1.4{\%} of all screws) was found malpositioned at the subsequent perioperative examination and was extracted immediately and replaced. Further complications were not observed and none of the procedures had to be converted into a standard fluoroscopy guided operation. CONCLUSION: A short but intensive experience with perioperative CT navigation allows us to state: 1. CT navigation shortens the operating time and minimalizes the risk of screw malposition in multiple screw spine procedures; 2. CT navigation improves the introduction of iliosacral and pubic screws in pelvic fixations; 3. there is virtually no radiation load to the staff using the CT navigation; 4. mastering this technique will allow a wider use of miniinvasive screw insertion in the pelvis and other regions where minimal dislocation will enable miniinvasive internal fixation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of posterior semi-laminectomy, restoration of bony fragments and short-segment pedicle screw fixation for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From January 2008 to April 2011, 21 patients (19 males and 2 females) who suffered single-level thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled in this study. Fractures at T11, T12, L1, L2 and L3 level occurred in 3, 5, 8, 4 cases and 1 case, respectively. The patients enrolled were presented with 30{\%}-50{\%} encroachment of spinal canal, partial neurological function deficits and intact pedicles, and underwent semi-laminectomy on the fractured thoracolumbar spine, restoration of the fractured bony fragments with special bone punch beneath dural sac, as well as pedicle screw fixation of the fractured thoracolumbar spine and the two vertical neighboring segments. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12-48 months, with a mean of 17 months. The mean kyphotic deformity was reduced from (17.3 +/- 5.3) degrees preoperatively to (9.2 +/- 4.1) degrees at follow-up within 12 months. The mean spinal canal diameter increased from (9.7 +/- 2.7) mm before surgery to (13.3 +/- 1.4) mm at follow-up. Neurological improvement occurred in all subjects after average 2.5 months (range, 1-7 months). Only postoperative wound dehiscence was observed in 1 case, which was caused by implant reaction of calcium phosphate and healed after debridement. CONCLUSION: Semi-laminectomy and restoration of bony fragments is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for thoracolumbar burst fractures with spinal canal encroachment of less than 50{\%}.},

The indication for neurosurgical instrumentation was placed, although he refused the treatment. Hence he was treated conservatively without a significant improvement up to January 2012 when, still refusing surgery, he accepted to undergo percutaneous vertebroplasty with a novel bioactive injectable strontium-hydroxyapatite cement. Vertebroplasty was performed without complications. A CT scan, performed the day after the procedure, ruled out extravertebral cement leakage. Pain improvement was significant (preprocedure VAS 10, one-week VAS 4) with a gradual decrease up to three months when it stabilized at 2. CT examination after 1 year showed a good cement osseointegration with osteophytic spurs bridging the superior endplate of the level involved to the inferior one of the level above. The new bone ingrowing property of the strontium-hydroxyapatite containing cement permits to extend the treatment indication also to unstable collapses in which the risk of pseudoarthrosis is very high. In this reported case we evaluated the potential role of percutaneous vertebroplasty in traumatic burst fracture with spinal channel involvement.},

She had already undergone resection of the L1 and L2 spinous processes for sharp angular kyphosis, but she still had severe kyphosis and back pain at the L1 and L2. Radiographical examination revealed fused anterior columns at L1 and L2 with severe local kyphosis and a significantly decreased percutaneous distance in the back. The patient underwent anterior instrumented bony resection including an L2 vertebral osteotomy: bilateral L2-L3 facetectomy and partial posterior osteotomy of the L2 vertebrae via a posterior approach followed by an anterior corpectomy of the L2 vertebrae and insertion of a cylindrical cage. No posterior instrumentation was used owing to the presence of atrophied paraspinal soft tissues. Lumbar interbody fusion was performed with vertebral body screws extending from T12 to L4 and corresponding anterior distension and posterior compression. The procedure corrected the kyphosis by 15 degrees and enhanced local stability. Postsurgical visual analogue scale improved from 9.0 to 2.0 and Oswestry Disability Index from 40 to 17.8, respectively. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that anterolateral interbody fusion using extended fixation can compensate for posterior corrective surgery.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Reliability and agreement study, retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To develop a widely accepted, comprehensive yet simple classification system with clinically acceptable intra- and interobserver reliability for use in both clinical practice and research. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although the Magerl classification and thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) are both well-known schemes to describe thoracolumbar (TL) fractures, no TL injury classification system has achieved universal international adoption. This lack of consensus limits communication between clinicians and researchers complicating the study of these injuries and the development of treatment algorithms. METHODS: A simple and reproducible classification system of TL injuries was developed using a structured international consensus process. This classification system consists of a morphologic classification of the fracture, a grading system for the neurological status, and description of relevant patient-specific modifiers. Forty cases with a broad range of injuries were classified independently twice by group members 1 month apart and analyzed for classification reliability using the Kappa coefficient (kappa). RESULTS: The morphologic classification is based on 3 main injury patterns: type A (compression), type B (tension band disruption), and type C (displacement/translation) injuries. Reliability in the identification of a morphologic injury type was substantial (kappa= 0.72). CONCLUSION: The AOSpine TL injury classification system is clinically relevant according to the consensus agreement of our international team of spine trauma experts. Final evaluation data showed reasonable reliability and accuracy, but further clinical validation of the proposed system requires prospective observational data collection documenting use of the classification system, therapeutic decision making, and clinical follow-up evaluation by a large number of surgeons from different countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar burst fracture is a common clinical injury, and the fracture mechanism is still controversial. The aim of this research was to study the formation of intracanal fracture fragments in thoracolumbar burst fractures and to provide information for the prevention of thoracolumbar bursts fractures and reduction of damage to the nervous system. METHODS: A nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model of T11-3 segments was established, and the injury processes of thoracolumbar bursts were simulated. The intact finite element model and the finite element model after the superior articular were impacted by 100 J of energy in different directions. The distribution and variation of stress in the superior posterior region of the L1 vertebral body were analyzed. Abaqus 6.9 explicit dynamic solver was used as finite element software in calculations. RESULTS: A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of the thoracolumbar spine was created. In the intact model, stress was concentrated in the superior posterior region of the L1 vertebral body. The stress peak was a maximum for the extension impact load and a minimum for the flexion impact load. The stress peak and contact force in the facet joint had close correlation with time. The stress peak disappeared after excision of the superior articular process. CONCLUSIONS: The three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model was suitable for dynamic analysis. The contact force in the facet joint, which can be transferred to the superior posterior vertebral body, may explain the spinal canal fragment in thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

METHODS: Normal human nucleus pulposus tissues were harvested for culture and identification of NPCs from 6 patients with burst lumbar vertebra fracture. NPCs at passages 1, 3, 5, and 7 in the in-vitro monolayer culture were harvested to observe the morphology, cell aging, and proteoglycan expression. The cell proliferation rates of NPCs at passage 1 in-vitro in monolayer culture and in 3-D alginate microsphere culture were detected. NPCs at passage 7 were randomly divided into 3-D alginate microsphere control group (group A), RES group (group B), silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)- small interfering RNA (siRNA) + RES group (group C), and negative control-siRNA + RES group (group D); and NPCs in the in-vitro monolayer culture was monolayer control group (group E). After corresponding treatment, Western blot was used for determining the protein expressions of SIRT1, Aggrecan, and collagen type II; real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used for detecting SIRT1 mRNA expression. RESULTS: The cultured cells were identified to be NPCs. Morphological observation, senescence-associated P-galactosidase (SA-P-gal) staining, and toluidine blue staining showed that dedifferentiation of normal NPCs tended to occur under continuous in-vitro monolayer culture, which was more obvious with increase of passage number. NPCs in 3-D alginate microsphere culture showed significantly lower proliferation rate than NPCs in the in-vitro monolayer culture (P {\textless} 0.05), but it could significantly improve the protein expressions of collagen type II and Aggrecan in dedifferentiated NPCs, showing significantly difference between groups E and A (P {\textless} 0.05). The protein expressions of SIRT1, collagen type II, and Aggrecan in group B were significantly improved when compared with that in group A (P {\textless} 0.05). Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot showed that the expressions of SIRT1 mRNA and proteins in group C were significantly inhibited after transfected with SIRT1-siRNA when compared with those in groups B and D (P {\textless} 0.05), and the protein expressions of collagen type II and Aggrecan in group C were significantly lower than those in groups B and D (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Continuous in-vitro monolayer culture could efficiently cultivate numerous seeding NPCs, but it is liable to dedifferentiate. In 3-D alginate microsphere culture, RES could restore the phenotype of dedifferentiated NPCs and synthesize more extracellular matrix, which is related to the regulation of SIRT1.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A retrospective study to assess the health-related quality of life in patients undergoing posterior fixation of thoracolumbar fractures, and to compare the outcome with norm scores and HRQL in patients undergoing surgical treatment for degenerative conditions of the spine. METHODS: The study population consisted of 93 consecutive patients surgically treated for a thoracolumbar fracture from 2005 to 2009. All patients underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation and fusion. 83 patients were available for follow-up. Three questionnaires reflecting health-related quality of life (HRQL) were mailed to the patients: SF-36, ODI, and EQ-5D. RESULTS: 52 men and 31 women were operated with an average age at the time of surgery of 46 years. All fractures were AO-type A3.1 and A3.2 with L1 being the primary fracture level. All patients were neurologically intact; Frankel E. The overall response rate on the questionnaires was 75{\%} with no significant differences between responders and non-responder on basic demographic characteristics. The median follow up period was 3.8 years (range 2-6 years). The scores on all three questionnaires were significantly reduced compared to the national norm scores (p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life is affected several years after short segment posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures without neurological deficit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The conventional surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures is physically invasive for the patient and also causes problems such as the sacrifice of healthy mobile segments to stabilize the fracture site. We performed a procedure for the treatment of fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures by combining percutaneous short pedicle screw fixation and vertebroplasty with transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite blocks grafting. METHODS: Patients with type A3 fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures with no or mild neurological symptoms were treated using temporary posterior fixation without fusion. Consecutive 21 patients were studied, with a mean age of 45.4 years (range 23-73) and a mean follow-up period of 21.9 months (range 15-25). We evaluated operative time, estimated blood loss, low back pain on a visual analogue scale, change in the kyphotic angle, correction loss, bone union, and complications. RESULTS: The average operative time was 95.7 min (range 69-143), and the average blood loss was 38.6 mL (range 10-130). The average correction angle was 9.6 degrees . There were slight correction losses of height of the vertebral bodies. Bone union was obtained in all patients, with no instrumentation failures. Our procedure resulted in no surgery-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of type A3 fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures, this method is less invasive and can preserve the adjacent healthy mobile segment. Our treatment is an optional therapeutic strategy for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and is a good option particularly for young adult patients.},

abstract = {A fall from high height can cause thoracolumbar spine fracture with retropulsion  of endplate fragments into the canal leading to neurological deficit. Our objectives were to develop a hybrid cadaveric/surrogate model for producing thoracolumbar spine injury during simulated fall from height, evaluate the feasibility and performance of the model, and compare injuries with those observed clinically. Our model consisted of a 3-vertebra human lumbar specimen (L3-L4-L5) stabilized with muscle force replication and mounted within an impact dummy. The model was subjected to a fall from height of 2.2 m with impact velocity of 6.6 m/s. Kinetic and kinematic time-history responses were determined using spinal and pelvis load cell data and analyses of high-speed video. Injuries to the L4 vertebra were evaluated by fluoroscopy, radiography, and detailed anatomical dissection. Peak compression forces during the fall from height occurred at 7 ms and reached 44.7 kN at the ground, 9.1 kN at the pelvis, and 4.5 kN at the spine. Pelvis acceleration peaks reached 209.9 g at 8 ms for vertical and 62.8 g at 12 ms for rearward. Tensile load peaks were then observed (spine: 657.0 N at 47 ms; pelvis: 569.4 N at 61 ms). T1/pelvis peak flexion of 68.3 degrees occurred at 38 ms as the upper torso translated forward while the pelvis translated rearward. Complete axial burst fracture of the L4 vertebra was observed including endplate comminution, retropulsion of bony fragments into the canal, loss of vertebral body height, and increased interpedicular distance due to fractures anterior to the pedicles and a vertical split fracture of the left lamina. Our dynamic injury model closely replicated the biomechanics of real-life fall from height and produced realistic, clinically relevant burst fracture of the lumbar spine. Our model may be used for further study of thoracolumbar spine injury mechanisms and injury prevention strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the United States, major compression and burst type fractures ({\textgreater}20{\%} height loss) of the lumbar spine occur as a result of motor vehicle crashes, despite the improvements in restraint technologies. Lumbar burst fractures typically require an axial compressive load and have been known to occur during a non-horizontal crash event that involve high vertical components of loading. Recently these fracture patterns have also been observed in pure horizontal frontal crashes. This study sought to examine the contributing factors that would induce an axial compressive force to the lumbar spine in frontal motor vehicle crashes. METHODS: We searched the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS, 1993-2011) and Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN, 1996-2012) databases to identify all patients with major compression lumbar spine (MCLS) fractures and then specifically examined those involved in frontal crashes. National trends were assessed based on weighted NASS estimates. Using a case-control study design, NASS and CIREN cases were utilized and a conditional logistic regression was performed to assess driver and vehicle characteristics. CIREN case studies and biomechanical data were used to illustrate the kinematics and define the mechanism of injury. RESULTS: During the study period 132 NASS cases involved major compression lumbar spine fractures for all crash directions. Nationally weighted, this accounted for 800 cases annually with 44{\%} of these in horizontal frontal crashes. The proportion of frontal crashes resulting in MCLS fractures was 2.5 times greater in late model vehicles (since 2000) as compared to 1990s models. Belted occupants in frontal crashes had a 5 times greater odds of a MCLS fracture than those not belted, and an increase in age also greatly increased the odds. In CIREN, 19 cases were isolated as horizontal frontal crashes and 12 of these involved a major compression lumbar burst fracture primarily at L1. All were belted and almost all occurred in late model vehicles with belt pretensioners and buckets seats. CONCLUSION: Major compression burst fractures of the lumbar spine in frontal crashes were induced via a dynamic axial force transmitted to the pelvis/buttocks into the seat cushion/pan involving belted occupants in late model vehicles with increasing age as a significant factor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the various treatments of neurologically involved unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, the combination of anterior and posterior instrumentation provides the most stable reconstruction. However, the use of both approaches on a trauma patient may increase the morbidity. This study is a retrospective matched cohort study to evaluate the advantages of a single stage posterior approach for spinal canal decompression in combination with circumferential reconstruction by comparing the clinical and radiographic results. METHODS: From March 2005 to September 2009, patients with matched type spinal fracture, ages at surgery, and involved levels in our institute underwent either a single stage posterior approach (group one, n = 12) or traditional combined approach (group two, n = 14) for spinal canal decompression and circumferential reconstruction were reviewed. Pre- and post-operative X-ray flms were reviewed and changes in Cobb angle of thoracolumbar spine were documented. Intra-operative, post-operative, and general complications were registered. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was (27.7 +/- 9.6) months (range, 14 to 56 months) in group one and (29.2 +/- 7.4) months (range, 20 to 60 months) in group two (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The mean operation time was 214 minutes (range, 186 +/- 327 minutes) in group one and 284 minutes (range, 219 +/- 423 minutes) in group two (P {\textless} 0.05). The average volume of intraoperative blood loss was 1856 ml (range, 1250 +/- 3480 ml) in group one and 2453 ml (range, 1600 +/- 3680 ml) in group two (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the groups one and two in average vertebral body height loss at the injured level and the average Cobb angle in sagittal plane before and immediately after surgery. Postoperatively, there was an epidural hematoma in one patient in group one and two patients in group two. Bony union after stabilization was obtained in all patients, without loosening or breakage of screws. Loss of correction (5 degrees ) was seen in 1 patient in group one at the 6th month owing to the subsidence of the Titanium mesh cages into the vertebra. In group two, totally four patients suffered respiratory-related complication, including pneumonia in two, severe atelectasis in one and pleural effusions in one. Importantly, there were no intraoperative or postoperative deaths in any group. All patients with incomplete neurologic deficits improved at least 1 Frankel grade. CONCLUSION: Single-stage posterior vertebra resection in combination with circumferential reconstruction is a new option to manage severe thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Only limited data are available concerning the effect of ventral thoracoscopic spondylodesis (VTS) on elderly patients and the medium-term outcome. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a retrospective study, 23 patients were included from 2003 to 2008. An age over 60, a traumatic burst fracture in the thoracolumbar region and a VTS procedure were inclusion criteria. A preoperative neurological deficit, ASA scores greater than 3 and a malignant disease were exclusion criteria. The mean age was 65 (62-70) years, 17 male and 6 female patients were included. In 87 {\%} (n = 18) of the patients a compression fracture type A was found. Bone density values were obtained in 5 patients, mean value was -1,7. 21 patients were treated with a dorsoventral, bisegmental procedure. Two patients with limited kyphosis and no relevant stenosis of the spinal canal were treated with a ventral only procedure. In two cases with measured low bone quality, pedicle screws were placed with bone cement. Patients were monitored on ICU for 24 hours after operation until the thoracic drainage was removed. At an average follow-up of 3.9 years, patients were evaluated with SF 36 (short form 36) and an Oswestry disability index score (ODI score). The postoperative radiographic control was performed with a CT scan, X-ray controls were taken 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the operation. Cobb angle and scoliosis angle were measured. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS-Software 17.0 (SPSS(R), Inc., Chicago, USA) and a Mann-Whitney U test and a level of significance of p {\textless} 0,05. RESULTS: In five patients pulmonary complications occurred, in one case a revision operation had to be performed due to pleural effusion. One patient suffered from a delayed pneumonia. The mean loss of correction in all patients was 3,3 degrees (-20 degrees -1 degrees ). In four patients with a distinct loss of correction at an average of 13,6 degrees +/- 4,5 degrees , iatrogenic damage of the lower or upper cover plate of the adjacent vertebral bodies was found. The risk of loss of correction was found to be significantly higher in case of damage to the lower or upper cover plate (p {\textless} 0.001). Test results from the SF 36 score (sum scale 40.8) showed no significant difference in life quality to a similar aged comparison group. The ODI score revealed a mean vertebral column associated impairment of 10.8 {\%}, 20 patients showed only minimal limitations. CONCLUSION: Also in older patients VTS seems to be an adequate treatment of traumatic burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Perioperative pulmonary complications were easy to handle and had no effect on the clinical outcome. Postoperative radiographs showed only little loss of correction, in four cases iatrogenic damage of the cover-plate led to a distinct loss of correction. Careful and accurate preparation of the cover plates is therefore decisive.},

abstract = {Paradigm change has recently taken place in spine surgery with the application of minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive techniques have several advantages over the open traditional techniques: less blood loss, preservation of spine muscle integrity, shorter hospitalization, early mobilization, reduced pain levels, lower risk of infection. The presented cases cover following lumbar pathologies: segmental spinal instability, LV-SI grade II. spondylolisthesis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spine trauma. Unilateral or bilateral mini-open technique was employed in the degenerative cases, depending on symptoms and signes. If unilateral symptoms--pathology was identified, screws and rod were implanted percutaneously on the side contralateral to the pathology. The segmental fusion between vertebral bodies was always assured by a cage and autologous bone. The presented trauma case involved combined AO type A2 and B fractures. The anterior column was strengthened with vertebral body stents filled with bone cement, the posterior column was fixed with a percutaneously implanted screw rod system. Insertion of stents in the collapsed vertebra significantly increased the vertebral body height and also improved the stability of the spine. Minimally invasive spine surgery techniques appear more advantageous over the traditional open spine surgery that necessitates for large midline approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the options of percutaneous systems for reducing relevant posttraumatic kyphosis in spinal burst fractures. Clinical advantages of percutaneous techniques are evident from the literature and a disadvantage can be a lack of repositioning options in reducing the fracture kyphosis. Better results seem to be possible with new techniques and especially monoaxial percutaneous screws. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 70 patients with burst fractures (AO type Magerl A3.1-A3.3) of the thoracolumbar spine were treated with a special percutaneous reduction technique in the Trauma Clinic in Murnau (BGU) Germany between July 2009 and March 2011. Posttraumatic, intraoperative and postoperative kyphosis was measured in computed tomography (CT) scans in monosegmental and bisegmental angles. Two different percutaneous fixation systems were compared for reduction. Statistical analyses were carried out with Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a highly significant difference between preoperative and postoperative kyphosis angles but no differences in reduction between the two percutaneous systems. In 39 cases additional reconstruction of the anterior column was necessary because of a ventral defect. In comparison to the MCS 2 study of the German Society of Trauma Surgery (DGU) we found no differences in postoperative kyphosis angles (3 degrees ). CONCLUSION: A significant reduction of posttraumatic kyphosis of thoracolumbar burst fractures is possible with percutaneous techniques. Prerequisites are percutaneous monoaxial screws and tools and a special percutaneous technique as described.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the years 2002 and 2003 a total of 16 patients with incomplete cranial burst fractures were treated by ventral thoracoscopic monosegmental spondylodesis and were included in this study prospectively. The data acquisition was done preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. After 6 years a follow-up examination was performed in 13 of these patients (5 men and 8 women, average age 36.3 years, follow-up rate 81{\%}) and 8 patients were treated ventrally only whereas 5 patients were treated dorsoventrally. RESULTS: The operative reduction of the kyphotic malalignment was superior in the dorsoventrally treated patients. The persistent gain of monosegmental correction after 6 years seemed to be higher in the patient group treated dorsoventrally. The average physical component summary (PSC) scores were comparable to a control group of the same age and revision surgery was performed in two patients both related to the iliac crest bone graft. CONCLUSIONS: The ventral and dorsoventral therapy strategies showed good and very good functional outcomes, respectively. The dorsoventral treatment concept secured a persistent gain of monosegmental correction which seemed to be superior compared to a ventral only therapy strategy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The proposed the thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) for  thoracolumbar injury cites the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC). However, no report has elucidated the severity of damage in thoracic and lumbar injury with classification schemes by presence of the PLC injury. The purpose of this study was to accurately assess the severity of damage in thoracic and lumbar burst fractures with the PLC injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients treated surgically for thoracic and lumbar burst fractures were enrolled in this study. There were 71 men and 29 women whose mean age was 36 years. Clinical and radiologic data were investigated, and the thoracolumbar injury classification schemes were also evaluated. All patients were divided into two groups (the P group with PLC injuries and the C group without PLC injuries) for comparative examination. RESULTS: Fourth-one of 100 cases showed PLC injuries in MRI study. The load sharing classification score was significantly higher in the P group [7.8+/-0.2 points for the P group and 6.9+/-1.1 points for the C group (p{\textless}0.001)]. The TLICS (excluded PLC score) score was also significantly higher in the P group [6.2+/-1.1 points for the P group and 4.0+/-1.4 points for the C group (p{\textless}0.001)]. CONCLUSION: The presence of PLC injury significantly influenced the severity of damage. In management of thoracic lumbar burst fractures, evaluation of PLC injury is important to accurately assess the severity of damage.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective observational study. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of thoracoscopically assisted corpectomy with posterior percutaneous transpedicular instrumentation in prone position achieves treatment goals in burst thoracic or thoracolumbar fractures and minimizes the associated morbidities. METHODS: Between December 2007 and December 2008, 26 patients with acute burst spinal fractures were operated upon in our hospital. Those patients underwent posterior percutaneous stabilization plus anterior thoracoscopically assisted corpectomy and fusion in prone position. Clinical and radiological outcomes of these patients were evaluated after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) combined with clinical examination was used for clinical evaluation. Plain X-ray in two views was used for the radiological evaluation. RESULTS: The mean operative time was 248 min. The average blood loss was 765 ml. Ten patients had preoperative neurological deficits ranging from Frankel A to D. One patient did not show any neurological improvement at the final follow-up. The mean ODI at final follow-up was about 7. The mean preoperative kyphosis angle was 25.58 degrees , improved to 9.2 degrees postoperatively and to 13.8 degrees at the final follow-up. No cases of implant failure were reported at the final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal invasive spinal techniques including thoracoscopic decompression and fusion and short segment posterior percutaneous instrumentation showed good clinical outcomes and can be considered as alternative to open procedures with decreased rates of morbidities in managing burst thoracic and thoracolumbar fractures.},

The immediate postoperative erect radiographs were compared with the erect radiographs at the last follow-up by 2 independent observers (spine fellows not involved in the management of the patients) critically for any rotational instability using the Nash-Moe technique of assessment of vertebral rotation as well as for any "parallelogram effect." The intraobserver and interobserver reliability was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 208 cases included in the study during the study period that satisfied the criteria. The total number of motion segments fused was 707 ranging from 1 to 15 involving various etiologies. The average follow-up was 15 months (12-36 mo). Barring one patient with a thoracolumbar fracture with rotational instability (AO [Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen] type C) who had undergone a short-segment fixation, none of the cases demonstrated any rotational instability in the follow-up radiographs. Interestingly, the rotational instability (parallelogram effect) in that patient got corrected spontaneously once anterior reconstruction was performed. The intraobserver reliability was 100{\%} and the interobserver reliability was 92.83{\%}. This variability was in assessing the grade of vertebral rotation only; none of the levels had a change in rotation irrespective of variation in grade assessment in the final postoperative radiograph. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that use of cross-links in clinical practice may be avoidable. The derivations from biomechanical studies do not translate into clinical advantages. Eliminating the usage of cross-links reduces the operative time as well as the overall total hospital costs (a single cross-link may cost anywhere between {\$}1500 and {\$}2000 and surgeons tend to use single or multiple cross-links). Additionally, prominence of implants, corrosion, infection, implant failure, and pseudarthrosis are the other complications attributed to cross-links in the literature that can be eliminated by preventing their incorporation in spinal constructs.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is significant controversy surrounding the ideal management of  thoracolumbar burst fractures. While several treatment and management algorithms have been proposed, the ideal treatment strategy for these fractures remains unsettled. The authors review their experience with short-segment posterior fusion followed by anterior thoracoscopic corpectomy for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: We identified all patients treated by a single surgeon at our institution from 2002 to 2009 with short-segment posterior fusion followed by anterior thoracoscopic corpectomy for unstable thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. Demographic data, mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, Cobb angle, American Spinal Injury Association score, associated injuries, tobacco use, follow-up duration, and radiographic studies were all collected. Outcomes were assessed for fracture alignment (preoperative, postoperative, and long-term follow-up kyphosis), rate of fusion, neurological outcome, and treatment complications. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction defined as T10 to L1 were included. At a mean follow-up of 20.4 months, 90 {\%} of patients had demonstrated radiographic evidence of fusion and 91 {\%} retained the correction of their kyphotic deformity. There were three complications in the series. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment posterior fusion with thoracoscopic anterior corpectomy represents an alternative to traditional open treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. A thoracoscopic approach allows for a short-segment posterior fusion, reducing the loss of adjacent motion segments, minimizes morbidity associated with traditional open anterior approaches, allows for anterior and posterior column stabilization, and is associated with a high rate of bony fusion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Iatrogenic dural tears are common complications encountered in spine surgery with known ramifications. There is little information, however, with respect to the implications and complications of traumatic dural tears. PURPOSE: To describe the demographics and characteristics of traumatically acquired dural tears and evaluate the complication rate associated with traumatic dural tears in patients who have undergone surgical treatment for spine injuries. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single Level I trauma center to identify patients with traumatic dural tears between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample comprises 187 patients with traumatic dural tears identified from 1,615 patients who underwent operative management of their traumatic injury. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures consisted of a description of the location and nature of dural tears and associated fracture patterns and neurologic status as well as an assessment of complications attributable to the traumatic dural tear. METHODS: No funding was received or used in this study. In total, 1,615 operatively managed spine injuries over a 7-year period were reviewed to identify 187 patients with traumatic dural tears. Operative reports were reviewed to assess location and description of injury as well as type of repair, if done. Associated spinal cord injuries as well as fracture level, patterns, and complications were recorded. Postoperative records were assessed focusing on complications related to the traumatic dural tears. RESULTS: Traumatic dural tears were identified in 9.1{\%} (67/739) of cervical, 9.9{\%} (45/452) of thoracic, and 17.6{\%} (75/424) of lumbosacral spine fractures. Among the patients, 82.3{\%} (154/187) had a formal dural repair. Fracture patterns included burst (AO Type A3) 26.2{\%} (49/187), flexion distraction (AO Type B) 16{\%} (30/187), and fracture dislocations (AO Type C) 36.4{\%} (68/187). A complete neurologic injury was noted in 48.7{\%} (91/187) of the patient population, whereas no neurologic injury was noted in 17.1{\%} (32/187). Two patients (1{\%}) developed a persistent cerebral spinal fluid leak that necessitated an irrigation and debridement with exploration and closure of the cerebral spinal fluid tear. Two patients (1{\%}) developed a pseudomeningocele; one required a return to the operating room for irrigation and debridement, and the other suspected of having developed meningitis was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Among the patients, 2.1{\%} (4/187) were noted to have a complication directly related to a traumatic dural tear. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic dural tears occurred in 11.6{\%} of patients with operatively managed traumatic spine injuries at a regional Level 1 trauma center. In total, 83{\%} had a neurologic injury and 49{\%} had complete spinal cord injuries. Patients with traumatically induced dural tears have a low likelihood of developing a complication attributable to the dural tear.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of wide posterior release on the correction of  severe and rigid thoracic scoliosis in sagittal plane. METHODS: A total of 37 idiopathic scoliosis patients (26 females and 11 males) with severe and rigid thoracic curves corrected with posterior pedicle screw system between 2006 and 2009 were recruited. Their average age was 17.3 years (range: 14 - 22) at operation and the thoracic Cobb angle was between 70 - 100 degrees . They were separated into 2 groups: group A (n = 15) with wide posterior release and group B (n = 22) with posterior soft tissue release alone. The preoperative, postoperative and latest standing posteroanterior and lateral radiographs during follow-ups were reviewed. RESULTS: All patients were operated successfully. No statistic difference existed in the average operative duration between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The average volume of blood loss was 874 ml in Group A versus 712 ml in Group B (P {\textless} 0.05). The average coronal Cobb angle on postoperative standing photograph was 27.4 degrees (68.1{\%} correction) in Group A and 35.6 degrees (56.9{\%} correction) in Group B. For comparing sagittal correction results in patients with similar thoracic sagittal deformities, we distinguished subgroup A1 (preoperative TKA {\textless} 40 degrees ) from subgroup A2 (preoperative TKA {\textgreater} 40 degrees ) in group A and subgroup B1 (preoperative TKA {\textless} 40 degrees ) from subgroup B2 (preoperative TKA {\textgreater} 40 degrees ) in group B. The postoperative TKA was 26.8 degrees ({\textgreater} 9.2 degrees than preoperation) in subgroup A1 and 12.5 degrees (3.1 degrees {\textless} preoperation) in subgroup B1 (P {\textless} 0.05). The postoperative TKA was 28.4 degrees (24.9 degrees {\textless} preoperation) in subgroup A2 and 39.1 degrees (10.3 degrees {\textless} preoperation) in subgroup B2 (P {\textless} 0.05). There was one case of dural leakage in group A. A leakage of cerebrospinal fluid was cured with a prone position and wound compression. One case of infection in superficial part of wound in group B was cured after debridement. No nerve system injury, deep infection or instrumentation failure was found. During a follow-up period of 2 years, there was no obvious correction loss or trunk decompensation. CONCLUSION: In idiopathic scoliosis patients with severe and rigid thoracic curves, wide posterior release via a posterior approach may help to correct the deformity in sagittal plan and achieve more coronal correction in these curves.},

abstract = {Posterior instrumentation is a common fixation method used to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, the role of different cross-link configurations in improving fixation stability in these fractures has not been established. A 3D finite element model of T11-L3 was used to investigate the biomechanical behavior of short (2 level) and long (4 level) segmental spine pedicle screw fixation with various cross-links to treat a hypothetical L1 vertebra burst fracture. Three types of cross-link configurations with an applied moment of 7.5 Nm and 200 N axial force were evaluated. The long construct was stiffer than the short construct irrespective of whether the cross-links were used (p {\textless} 0.05). The short constructs showed no significant differences between the cross-link configurations. The XL cross-link provided the highest stiffness and was 14.9{\%} stiffer than the one without a cross-link. The long construct resulted in reduced stress to the adjacent vertebral bodies and screw necks, with 66.7{\%} reduction in bending stress on L2 when the XL cross-link was used. Thus, the stability for L1 burst fracture fixation was best achieved by using long segmental posterior instrumentation constructs and an XL cross-link configuration. Cross-links did not improved stability when a short structure was used.},

Different approaches and techniques have been utilized, but with high incidence of morbidity and mortality, besides unsatisfactory clinical and radiological results.

Here we report a case of acute lumbar burst fracture at L2 treated by minimally invasive true lateral approach posteriorly instrumented with percutaneous pedicle screws. The minimum disruptive access in addition to a rigid construction allowed a lumbar corpectomy without the morbidity of standard open approaches, lowering surgery costs and accelerating the patient recovery with successfully clinical and radiological results.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of single screwrod anterior instrumentation for  thoracolumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficit. METHODS: 16 men and 5 women aged 22 to 55 (mean, 34) years underwent single screw-rod anterior instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficit. The vertebrae involved were T10 (n=2), T11 (n=2), T12 (n=7), L1 (n=8), and L2 (n=2). No patient had disruption of the posterior ligament complex. Postoperatively, a thoracolumbar sacral orthosis was used until solid fusion. Outcome measures included neurological recovery, degree of kyphosis, complications, and pain and functional status of the patients. RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 36 (range, 13-50) months. All patients recovered neurologically by at least one grade. Of the 21 patients, 6 improved from grade B to grade C (n=4) or grade D (n=2), 13 from grade C to grade D, and 2 from grade D to grade E. The mean degree of kyphosis improved from 23 masculine +/- 5 masculine to 7 masculine +/- 3 masculine. Seven patients had complications including ipsilateral basal atelectasis (n=3), urinary tract infection (n=1), haematuria (n=1), postoperative ileus (n=1), and superficial wound infection (n=1). None had iatrogenic visceral or vascular injury, pseudoarthrosis or hardware-related complications. Only one patient had severe back pain persistently. CONCLUSION: Single screw-rod anterior instrumentation supplemented with an orthosis can be an alternative for double screw-rod anterior instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with smaller vertebral bodies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and safety of the treatment for thoracolumbar fractures with pedicle screw at the fracture level and vertebroplasty via paraspinal approach. METHODS: From August 2007 to August 2010, 22 old patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with pedicle screw at the fracture level and vertebroplasty via paraspinal approach. There were 14 males and 8 females, ranging in age from 60 to 71 years (mean, 64.6 years). The time from injury to surgery varied from 1 to 4 d (mean,2.7 d). All the patients suffered from single thoracolumbar fractures and located at T11 in 2 cases, at T12 in 5 cases, at L1 in 11 cases and at L2 in 4 cases. According to the Denis fracture classification, there were 6 compression fractures and 16 burst fractures. The mean preoperative load-sharing classification of spine fractures was 5.4 score. The mean preoperative thoracolumbar injury classification and scoring was 5.2. Based on the ASIA neurologic grading system, preoperative neurological function was grade B in 2 cases,grade C in 3 cases, grade D in 7 cases and grade E in 10 cases. The neurological function, vertebral central and anterior height, kyphotic angle of the vertebral fractures by radiographs and visual analog scale were calculated pre-operatively, post-operatively and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Median operating time was 60.8 min (ranged from 50 to 95 min) and median blood loss was 84 ml (ranged from 50 to 130 ml). The operative incisions were healed well. The duration of follow-up averaged 21.6 months (ranged from 12 to 48 months). The anterior vertebral body height was corrected from preoperative (52.3 +/- 10.3) {\%} to postoperative (6.1 +/- 4.2) {\%} and (6.8 +/- 5.4) {\%} at the last follow-up. The central vertebral body height was corrected from preoperative (38.9 +/- 11.2) {\%} to postoperative (8.3 +/- 4.7) {\%} and (9.4 +/- 4.5){\%} at the last follow-up. The Cobbs angle of the injured vertebral segment was corrected from preoperative (19.5 +/- 9.5) degrees to postoperative (4.3 +/- 4.1) degrees and (6.2 +/- 4.7) degrees at the last follow-up. The VAS scores reduced from preoperative 8.56 +/- 0.88 to post-operative 3.48 +/- 0.91 and 3.20 +/- 0.92 at the last follow-up. The postoperative neurologic function of all 22 patients improved 1 to 2 degrees except 10 patients of grade E. There were no instances of instrumentation failure and no patient had persistent postoperative back pain. CONCLUSION: The pedicle screw at the fracture level and vertebroplasty via paraspinal approach has the advantages of less invasive and blood loss, and could prevent the development of kyphosis and offers improvement of the spinal cord function. Furthermore, it could decrease the risks of postoperative back pain and the failure of instrumentation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore efficacy of modified funnel method for transpedicular bone  grafting in treating thoracolumbar vertebras fracture. METHODS: From May 2006 to November 2011, 35 patients (19 males and 16 females, ranged in age from 21 to 66 years with an average of 34.6 years) with thoracolumbar vertebras fracture were treated by posterior pedicle screw fixation, reduction and modified funnel method for transpedicular autogenous iliac bone grafting. Of the 35 cases, 9 cases were severe compression fracture and 26 cases were burst fracture. The anterior body height and Cobb's angle of injured vertebral were measured by X-ray; the effect of implantation bone and CT value were assessed by radiograph CT scan; Nerve function were evaluated according to Frankel's neurological function classification and back pain were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were followed up from 18 to 37 months with an average of 19.7 months. No nerve injuries aggravated, and 11 patients with partial nerve injuires preoperatively were improved at least 1 level recovery postoperatively; Breakage or loosen of screws were not found. Vertebral bone grafting filled well, bone fusion were got after 6 months' treatment and without cavity gap in grafting bone area. The anterior vertebral height was improved respectively from preoperative (50.17 +/- 8.26){\%} to postoperative (90.79 +/- 4.85){\%}, and (90.34 +/- 4.03){\%} at the final follow-up. The Cobb's angle improved from preoperative (28.7 +/- 6.24) degrees to postoperative (7.26 +/- 3.79) degrees, with (7.34 +/- 4.05) degrees at the final follow-up. CT value of injured vertebras at the final follow-up were significantly higher than adjacent vertebras'. The average VAS was 1.06. CONCLUSION: Posterior pedicle screw fixation, reduction and modified funnel method for transpedicular autogenous iliac bone grafting is a feasible and safe method for the treatment of thoracolumbar vertebras fracture. It can effectively prevent bone loss of injured vertebral height, progressive deformity of kyphosis, and keep spinal movement function at the maximum.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical effects of pedicle fixation without bone fusion in treating thoracolumbar fractures through paraspinal approach. METHODS: From January 2006 to January 2009, 25 patients (15 males and 10 females) with thoracolumbar fractures were treated. The average age was 39.3 years,ranged from 17 to 49 years. According to classification, flexion fracture in 7 cases, brust fracture in 18 cases. There were no nervous injury, and radiology information showed the angle of sagittal vertebral body {\textgreater}20 degrees or collapse of vertebral body {\textgreater}40{\%},without vertebral injury. The operation were performed at 3 to 7 days after injury (mean 5 day). Internal fixation implants were removed at 8 to 12 months after operation. The height, kyphosis angle were measured before operation, 1 week and 24 months after operation,and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were compared before and after operation. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 24 months. Among them, 1 case was followed up at 30 months after operation. The operation time ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 90) minutes, the blood loss was 120 to 280 (mean 200) ml. The height of vertebral body and kyphosis angle were obviously corrected, and had significant differences between postoperation immediately and at the final follow-up (P{\textless}0.05). There were no differences after remove of internal fixation (P{\textgreater}0.05). The final ODI was (5.36 +/- 1.21){\%}, had statistical differences compared with preoperation (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION: For flexion and burst thoracolumbar fractures without nervous injury, pedicle fixation without bone fusion is a good method,which has advantages of minimally invasive, rapid recovery, and maintain spinal motion segment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There has been no study regarding the comparison between vertebroplasty and conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture. PURPOSE: To compare the results of vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation with that of conservative treatment alone. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. METHODS: The vertebroplasty group included 40 consecutive patients with primary osteoporotic burst fracture who underwent vertebroplasty using calcium phosphate cement, and the control group was made up of 40 patients given conservative treatment alone who were matched for age, gender, the injury level, and the type of fracture. Two groups of patients who had no neural deficit were prospectively examined. Clinical and radiological outcomes of these two groups were compared blindly. The authors do not report any conflict of interest in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included visual analog scale (VAS) of the back pain, analgesic requirements, and mobility; in a lateral radiograph, the deformity index was measured and expressed as the ratio of the vertebral body (VB) height (sum of measurements at anterior, middle, and posterior regions of VB) to the longitudinal diameter of VB. Anteroposterior height comparison was expressed as the percentage of VB height at the anterior region compared with the height at the posterior region. Each recovery rate was calculated as a percentage by the formula: (value at the examination-value before treatment)/value before treatment x 100. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up was more than 12 months (mean; 22.5 months). The mean VAS at 12 months after injury was 2.17 cm in the conservative group and 0.61 cm in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0002). The mean duration of analgesic medication required was 157.2 days in the conservative group and 21.3 days in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0048). The mean deformity index at 12 months after injury was 1.66 in the vertebroplasty group and 1.38 in the control group, and the mean recovery rate was +7.3{\%} and -18.4{\%}, respectively (p{\textless}.0001). Anteroposterior height comparison at 12 months after injury was 49.1{\%} in the conservative group and 71.2{\%} in the vertebroplasty group, and the mean recovery rate was -26.4{\%} and +30.1{\%}, respectively (p{\textless}.0001). One fracture in the vertebroplasty group showed delayed union until 6 months after injury. In the control group, there were six delayed union including four pseudoarthroses at over 6 months after injury that caused leg pain and were treated by conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation provided a better clinical and radiological result than conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the post-traumatic disc degeneration and range of motion 10 years after short-segment fixation without fusion for thoracolumbar burst fractures with neurological deficit. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Early clinical results of short-segment fixation without fusion for thoracolumbar burst fractures were satisfactory. However, the long-term results have not been reported, and post-traumatic disc degeneration and preservation of thoracolumbar motion have not been elucidated. METHODS: Twelve patients who had thoracolumbar burst fractures and associated incomplete neurological deficit, operatively treated within 4 days of admission and had their implants removed within 1 year, were prospectively followed for at least 10 years. Following indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation, transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite grafting to the fractured vertebrae was performed. RESULTS: Sagittal alignment was improved from a mean preoperative kyphosis of 17 degrees to -2 degrees (lordosis) by operation, but was found to have slightly deteriorated to 2 degrees at the final follow-up observation. With respect to back pain, 8 patients did not report back pain. Three reported occasional minimal pain, and 1 reported moderate pain. None reported severe pain or needed daily dosages of analgesics.Regarding disc degeneration, the shape of the disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra had not changed from the preoperative to the 10-year postoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI). Although signal intensity of the disc had decreased by 1 grade from the preoperative to the 2-year postoperative MRI, the intensity had not changed from the 2-year postoperative MRI to the 10-year postoperative MRI. At the 10-year follow-up, flexion-extension radiographs revealed that a mean range of motion at the disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra was 12 masculine (range; 5-19). CONCLUSION: This unprecedented 10-year follow-up study demonstrated that posterior indirect reduction, transpedicular hydroxyapatite grafting, and pedicle screw fixation does not require fusion to a segment, thereby preserves thoracolumbar motion without resulting in post-traumatic disc degeneration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

PURPOSE: This study evaluates the use of the TLICS in a large, consecutive series of patients. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 458 patients treated for thoracic or lumbar spine trauma between 2000 and 2010 at a single, tertiary medical center were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) status and crossover from conservative to surgical treatment were measured. METHODS: Clinical and radiological data were evaluated, classifying the injuries by ASIA status, the Magerl/AO classification, and the TLICS system. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients (67.6{\%}) was treated conservatively (group 1) and 148 patients (32.3{\%}) were surgically (group 2) treated. All patients in group 1 were ASIA E, except one (ASIA C). In this group, 305 patients (98{\%}) had an AO type A fracture. The TLICS score ranged from 1 to 7 (mean 1.53, median 1). A total of 307/310 (99{\%}) patients matched TLICS treatment recommendation (TLICS{\textless}/=4), except three with distractive injuries (TLICS 7) initially misdiagnosed. Nine patients (2.9{\%}) were converted to surgical management. In group 2, 105 (70.9{\%}) were ASIA E, whereas 43 (29{\%}) had neurological deficits (ASIA A-D). One hundred and three patients (69.5{\%}) were classified as AO type A, 36 (24.3{\%}) as type B, and 9 (6{\%}) as type C. The TLICS score ranged from 2 to 10 (mean 4.29, median of 2). Sixty-nine patients (46.6{\%}) matched the TLICS recommendation; all discordant patients (53.4{\%}) were treated for stable burst fractures (TLICS=2). No neurological complications occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The TLICS recommendation matched treatment in 307/310 patients (99{\%}) in the conservative group. However, in the surgical group, 53.4{\%} of patients did not match TLICS recommendations, all were burst fractures without neurological injury (TLICS=2). The TLICS system can be used to effectively classify thoracolumbar injuries and guide conservative treatment. Inconsistencies, however, remain in the treatment thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

The aim of the present study was to report the spinal injuries during recent earthquake in northwest Iran, its consequences and management. Of the 923 hospitalized patients, 26 (2.8{\%}) had neurosurgical complications. The imaging and clinical data of the patients were retrospectively studied regarding the anatomical location of the injury, the severity of spinal injury and associated neurological deficit. To further analyze the findings, Magerl (AO) and Frankel's classifications were used. The injuries without any fracture were considered as minor spinal injuries. The mean age of the patients was 44.54+/-22.52 (range: 5-88) years. We detected a total of 38 vertebral injuries including 24 major (63.15{\%}) and 14 minor injuries (36.85{\%}). The most common injuries were observed in the lumbar spine (19 injuries, 50{\%}). The 24 major injuries chiefly included Magerl type A (14 injuries, 58.3{\%}). According to the Frankel's classification, majority of the patients (88.46{\%}) had no neurological deficit. In this study, three patients had nerve injuries. In conclusion, the number and proportion of spinal fractures patients in the recent twin earthquakes, northwest Iran was limited and caused less nerve injuries compared to the previous similar disasters. This might be due to the milder earthquake consequences since the incident happened in the middle of the day when men were working their fields. Potential complications in patients traumatized in earthquake incidents should be monitored for and early assessment of the neurological function is required to prioritize care for the victims.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although Denis classification is considered as one of most clinically useful schemes for the evaluation of spinal fracture, there is little documentation on the relationship between fracture pattern and the neurologic recovery. The purpose is to evaluate the correlation between the fracture patterns according to Denis classification and neurologic recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 38 patients (26 men and 12 women) in this series had an average follow-up of 47.1 months, and they were all managed surgically. Denis classification had been used prospectively to determine the fracture morphology. Frankel Scale and American Spinal Injury Association Spinal Cord Injury Assessment Form [American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score] were obtained before surgery, after surgery and at the final follow-up. RESULTS: The common injuries making neurologic deterioration were burst fracture and fracture-dislocation. The degree of neurologic deficits seen first and at the final follow-up was more severe in fracture-dislocation than burst fracture. The neurologic recovery was not different between burst fracture and fracture-dislocation, assessed by Frankel grading and ASIA scoring system. The neurologic recovery evaluated by ASIA score was not different between the lumbar and thoracic spinal fracture. The neurologic recovery assessed by Frankel grade was greater in the lumbar spinal fractures in than the thoracic spinal fractures. CONCLUSION: The severity of initial and the final follow-up neurologic deficits were correlated with the fracture patterns according to Denis classification, but the neurologic recovery was not correlated.},

It served as a retractor for the diaphragm, and offered a stable support for the scope and other instruments, making an assistant superfluous. Moreover, it allowed bimanual manipulation. Of course, the two-dimensional image, provided by the scope, necessitated proper eye-hand coordination. Twenty-eight consecutive patients underwent either a monosegmental (n = 10) or a bisegmental (n = 18) anterior stabilization in the area Th11L1. Three portals were necessary, but an assistant was not needed. The overall (mean +/- SD) operating time was 196 +/- 56 min, the blood loss was 804 +/- 719 mL. Intraoperatively, one epidural bleeding and a single screw cut-out occurred. All complications were managed endoscopically. Postoperatively, evacuation of a haemothorax (n = 1) was necessary. In all patients, wounds and fractures healed uneventfully. The combination of the endoscopic technique and the retractor system was feasible, successful, safe, and time efficient. Moreover, it allowed for anterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures by a single surgeon. It became the standard approach in the authors' department.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The AO Spine Classification Group was established to propose a revised AO spine injury classification system. This paper provides details on the rationale, methodology, and results of the initial stage of the revision process for injuries of the thoracic and lumbar (TL) spine. METHODS: In a structured, iterative process involving five experienced spine trauma surgeons from various parts of the world, consecutive cases with TL injuries were classified independently by members of the classification group, and analyzed for classification reliability using the Kappa coefficient (kappa) and for accuracy using latent class analysis. The reasons for disagreements were examined systematically during review meetings. In four successive sessions, the system was revised until consensus and sufficient reproducibility were achieved. RESULTS: The TL spine injury system is based on three main injury categories adapted from the original Magerl AO concept: A (compression), B (tension band), and C (displacement) type injuries. Type-A injuries include four subtypes (wedge-impaction/split-pincer/incomplete burst/complete burst); B-type injuries are divided between purely osseous and osseo-ligamentous disruptions; and C-type injuries are further categorized into three subtypes (hyperextension/translation/separation). There is no subgroup division. The reliability of injury types (A, B, C) was good (kappa = 0.77). The surgeons' pairwise Kappa ranged from 0.69 to 0.90. Kappa coefficients kappa for reliability of injury subtypes ranged from 0.26 to 0.78. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed TL spine injury system is based on clinically relevant parameters. Final evaluation data showed reasonable reliability and accuracy. Further validation of the proposed revised AO Classification requires follow-up evaluation sessions and documentation by more surgeons from different countries and backgrounds and is subject to modification based on clinical parameters during subsequent phases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) combined general anesthesia on myocardial injury of high blood sugar patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in the perioperative phase. METHODS: Recruited were 40 senile patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) more than 6.5{\%}. They were more than 60 years old. They received post-traumatic fracture reduction surgery of four limbs. They were randomly assigned to two groups, Group N (treated by general intravenous anesthesia) and Group D (treated by EA combined with general intravenous anesthesia), 20 in each group. All patients were maintained anesthesia by propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium. Prior to the induction of anesthesia, patients in Group D received induction of EA at Neiguan (PC6) and Baihui (DU20) for 20 min, which lasted to the end of the surgery. At before intubation (T0), immediately after intubation (T1), 5 min (T2), immediately after extubation (T3), 5 min (T4), 60 min (T5), 180 min (T6), the fast blood glucose (FBG), plasma vasoactive substance TXB2 and 6-K-prostacycline (6-K-PGF1alpha) were detected in the two groups. The glucose coefficient of variation (GluCV) and the ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha were calculated. The changes of ST-segment elevation (mV, sampling 1 min after each time point, and the mean calculated) was recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in all the tested values between the two groups at T0 (P{\textgreater}0.05). The FBG, ST elevation, and the ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha were significantly higher at each time point than at T0 in Group N (P{\textless}0.05), while there was no statistical difference in Group D (P{\textgreater}0.05). The ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha and ST elevation were significantly higher in Group N than in Group D (P{\textless}0.01). The TXB2 and 6-K-PGF1alpha were significantly higher at each time point than at T0 in the two groups (P{\textless}0.05). The increment of TXB2 was obviously lower in Group D than in Group N (P{\textless}0.05), but the increment of 6-K-PGF1alpha was obviously higher in Group D than in Group N (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION: EA could reduce the perioperative stress response to the injury of coronary vascular endothelial cells, and improve myocardial ischemia and CHD patients' prognosis by regulating the central nervous system, the cardiovascular active substances, and anti-oxygen free radicals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged healing and persistent inflammation following surgery for rhinosinusitis impacts patient satisfaction and healthcare resources. Cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are important mediators in T-helper 2 (Th2) inflammatory rhinosinusitis. Decreased wound healing has been demonstrated with Th2 cytokine exposure, but this has not been extensively studied in sinonasal epithelium. We hypothesized that in vitro exposure of primary sinonasal epithelial cell cultures to Th2 inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and IL-13 would impair wound resealing and decrease expression of annexin A2 at the wound edge. METHODS: Following 24-hour exposure to IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13 vs controls, sterile linear mechanical wounds were created in primary sinonasal epithelial cultures (n = 12 wounds per condition). Wounds were followed for 36 hours or until complete closure, and residual wound areas were calculated by image analysis. Group differences in annexin A2 were assessed by immunofluorescence labeling, confocal microscopy, and Western blots. RESULTS: Significant wound closure differences were identified across cytokine exposure groups (p {\textless} 0.001). Mean percentage wound closure at the completion of the 36-hour time course was 98.41{\%} +/- 3.43{\%} for control wounds vs 85.02{\%} +/- 18.46{\%} for IL-4 exposed wounds. IL-13 did not significantly impair sinonasal epithelial wound resealing in vitro. Annexin A2 protein levels were decreased in IL-4 treated wounds when compared to control wounds (p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Th2 cytokine IL-4 decreases sinonasal epithelial wound closure in vitro. Annexin A2 is also diminished with IL-4 exposure. This supports the hypothesis that IL-4 exposure impairs sinonasal epithelial wound healing and may contribute to prolonged healing in Th2 inflammatory rhinosinusitis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the results of three types of short segment screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia. METHODS: The records of 70 patients who underwent short segment screw fixation for a thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia (-2.5{\textless} mean T score by bone mineral densitometry {\textless}-1.0) from January 2005 to January 2008 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on whether or not bone fusion and bone cement augmentation procedure 1) Group I (n=26) : short segment fixation with posterolateral bone fusion; 2) Group II (n=23) : bone cement augmented short segment fixation with posterolateral bone fusion; 3) Group III (n=21) : bone cement augmented, short segment percutaneous screw fixation without bone fusion. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a visual analogue scale and modified MacNab's criteria. Radiological findings, including kyphotic angle and vertebral height, and procedure-related complications, such as screw loosening or pull-out, were analyzed. RESULTS: No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between patients managed using the three different techniques at last follow up. However, Group I showed more correction loss of kyphotic deformities and vertebral height loss at final follow-up, and Group I had higher screw loosening and implant failure rates than Group II or III. CONCLUSION: Bone cement augmented procedure can be an efficient and safe surgical techniques in terms of achieving better outcomes with minimal complications for thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia.},

abstract = {Thoracolumbar fracture is a common traumatic condition; however, the management remains challenging. The aim of this study is to establish criteria for selection of the anterior, posterior and posterolateral approaches for open reduction and internal fixation of thoracolumbar fracture. A group of 64 patients with Denis type A and B thoracolumbar burst fracture were treated with anterior, traditional posterior and paraspinal approach reduction with or without decompression. The fracture was fixed with titanium mesh and Z-plate by anterior approach and screw rod system by posterior approach and paraspinal approach. Clinical evaluations showed operation duration, blood loss, average length of incision and postoperative ODI in the paraspinal group were less than the traditional posterior group and anterior group. The statistical significant differences were reached (P {\textless} 0.05). There is not statistical difference between the three approaches for relevant parameters of radiographs (Cobb angle). The anterior approach surgery should be limitedly used for severe Denis type B fracture with direct reduction. The posterior approach is familiar to the spine surgeons and is commonly applied to most Denis type A and B thoracic lumbar fractures with indirect reduction and has less complication compared to the anterior approach, but also has some shortcomings. Paraspinal muscle approach is the muscle gap approach, in line with the minimally invasive surgery , which is now advocated with the idea with indirect reduction, compared to traditional surgery can significantly relieve postoperative pain and is worthy of further research and promotion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of craniocerebral traumas increases with a growing number of road accidents. It should be emphasized that it is rather difficult to determine precisely the craniocerebral traumas incidence rate, however, it is well known that road accidents are the major cause of these injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study embraced 43 men (mean age: 47.1; SD: 11.4) after craniocerebral traumas. Of the 43 men, 23 drivers had driving license of the following classes: A, Al, A2, AM, B, B1 and BE without professional driving permit, and 20 men worked as professional drivers licensed according to the following classes: C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1 and DIE. The duration of drivers' employment ranged from 4 to 33 years (mean: 19 years; SD: 7.7). The clinical diagnosis was based on the patient's medical history, medical records, neurological examination complemented with other specialist examinations. RESULTS: Posttraumatic encephalopathy diagnosed in 23 (53.5{\%}) patients was characterized by varied clinical symptoms. Posttraumatic simple encephalopathy diagnosed in 13 patients was the most frequent contradiction to run motor vehicles. Posttraumatic epilepsy was a contradiction in 5 and posttraumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage in 2 patients (one with neurological deficiency hemiparesis, the other with frontal lobe syndrome. Following the treatment 46.5{\%} of men under study did not show neurological deficits and were allowed to run motor vehicles. CONCLUSIONS: The certification procedure in cases of past craniocerebral traumas should not follow the routine and careful examination of each individual case is required prior to assessing a driver's ability to run motor vehicles.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main treatment method used for thoracolumbar fractures is open reduction and internal fixation. Commonly there are three surgical approaches: anterior, posterior and paraspinal. We attempt to compare the three approaches based on our clinical data analysis. METHODS: A group of 94 patients with Denis type A or B thoracolumbar burst fracture between March 2008 and September 2010 were recruited in this study. These patients were treated by anterior-, posterior- or paraspinal-approach reduction with or without decompression. The fracture was fixed with titanium mesh and Z-plate via anterior approach (24 patients), screw and rod system via posterior approach (38 patients) or paraspinal approach (32 patients). Clinical evaluations included operation duration, blood loss, incision length, preoperative and postoperative Oswestry disability index (ODI). RESULTS: The average operation duration (94.1 min +/- 13.7 min), blood loss (86.7 ml +/-0.0 ml), length of incision (9.3 mm +/- 0.7 mm) and postoperative ODI (6 +/- 0.5) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in paraspinal approach group than in traditional posterior approach group (operation duration 94.1 min +/- 13.7 min, blood loss 143.3 ml +/-28.3 ml, length of incision 15.4 cm +/- 2.1 cm and ODI 12 +/- 0.7) and anterior approach group (operation duration 176.3 min +/- 20.7 min, blood loss 255.1 ml +/- 38.4 ml, length of incision 18.6 cm +/- 2.4 cm and ODI 13 +/- 2.4). There was not statistical difference in terms of Cobb angle on radiographs among the three approaches. CONCLUSION: The anterior approach surgery is convenient for resection of the vertebrae and reconstruction of vertebral height, but it is more complicated and traumatic. Hence it is mostly used for severe Denis type B fracture. The posterior approach is commonly applied to most thoracolumbar fractures and has fewer complications compared with the anterior approach, but it has some shortcomings as well. The paraspinal approach has great advantages compared with the other two approaches. It is in accordance with the concept of minimally invasive surgery and can replace most posterior approach operations.},

METHODS: From January 2007 to March 2010,27 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with posterior open reduction and internal fixation with the approach through para-vertebral muscles. There were 19 males and 8 females with the mean age of 36.3 years old (ranged,21 to 57). According to Magerl type, type A2 was in 5 cases, A3 in 14, B1 in 3, B2 in 5. According to Frankel classification of spinal cord injury: grade D was in 6 cases and grade E in 21 cases. X-rays and CT scans were performed after operation. Cobb angle of the injured vertebral segment,the percentage of vertebral compression,and sagittal diameter stenosis rate of the injured spinal canal were observed by radiographic data. Neurological function was evaluated by the Frankel grade. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months with an average of 19.6 months. The percentage of vertebral compression, Cobb angle of the injured vertebral segment, spinal canal sagittal diameter stenosis rate were respectively corrected from (46.6 +/- 10.5){\%}, (18.3 +/- 7.2) degrees, (30.2 +/- 7.2){\%} to postoperative (5.2 +/- 3.7){\%}, (5.3 +/- 5.1) degrees, (6.3 +/- 4.2){\%} and (6.7 +/- 4.6){\%}, (7.1 +/- 3.1), (7.2 +/- 4.5){\%} at last follow-up. There were significant difference in above items between preoperation and postoperation (P {\textless} 0.05); and there was no significant difference in above items between postoperation and last follow-up (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In aspect of nerve function, 3 cases with Frankel grade D recovered to grade E. CONCLUSION: Using reduction and short-segment pedicle screws fixation at the fracture level through para-vertebral muscles approach is an effective method in treating thoracolumbar fractures. The method has advantages of simple operation,easy establishing screw, short operative time, less blood loss, which can obtain good reduction and stable, reliable fixation after operation.},

abstract = {OBJECT: To compare the clinical efficacy of titanium mesh cages and autogenous iliac bone graft to restore vertebral height through posterior approach in patients with thoracic and lumbar spinal tuberculosis. METHOD: 59 patients with spinal tuberculosis underwent interbody fusion and internal fixation through posterior approach in our department from January 2011 to December 2013. In group A, 34 patients obtained titanium mesh for the reconstruction of vertebral height, among them 25 patients (group A1) suffered from single-segment spinal tuberculosis, and 9 patients, (group A2) had multi-segment spinal tuberculosis. In group B, 25 patients got autogenous iliac bone graft to restore vertebral height, including 24 patients with single-segment spinal tuberculosis (group B1), and 1 patient with multi-segment spinal tuberculosis (group B2). The clinical efficacy was evaluated based on average operation time, blood loss, hospital stays, hospitalization expenses, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive protein (CRP), neurological function recovery, bony fusion, intervertebral height, Cobb angle and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Final follow-up time was an average of 35.5 months ranging from 15 to 56 months. All patients were completely cured and obtained solid bone fusion. The bony fusion time was 9.4+/-6.1 months in group A1, 10.2+/-2.7 months in group A2 and 8.7+/-3.6 months in group B1. There were no significant difference among three groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). The Cobb correction and restoration of intervertebral height significantly improved compared with those in preoperation, but without significant difference among three groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). The loss of angular correction and intervertebral height in group A1 were found to be less than those in group B1 (P{\textless}0.05), but with no significant difference between group A1 and group A2, and between group A2 and group B1 (P{\textgreater}0.05). Patients in group B1 got the most loss of angular correction and intervertebral height. In addition, neurological function was revealed to be significantly improved after surgery. There were significant differences of VAS, ODI, ESR and CRP between preoperation and postoperation at the final follow-up time (P{\textless}0.05), with no significant difference among three groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). No statistically significant difference was found when analyzing blood loss, hospital stays, hospitalization expenses, and corrective cost among three groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). Complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage (2 cases in group A1 and group A2), sinus formation (3 cases in group A1, group A2 and group B1), and intervertebral infection (1 case in group B1), but no implant failure or donor site complications was found in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Titanium mesh cages could obtain good clinical efficacy comparable to autogenous iliac bone graft when treating single-segment spinal tuberculosis, and may be better than autogenous iliac bone graft for treating multi-segment spinal tuberculosis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Burst fractures in thoracolumbar and lumbar spine typically occur from severe trauma, which may result in cauda equina herniation (CEH). In this study, we attempted to document the incidence and evaluate the sequelae of CEH that were found during decompression and fusion surgery for patients with burst fractures. PATIENT CONCERNS: A total of 416 patients were enrolled in this study. DIAGNOSES: The patients had been operated on through an anterior or posterior approach for treatments of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures at our department between June 1, 2008 and June 1, 2011. INTERVENTIONS: A retrospective analysis of hospital records and a review on radiographs were performed. Data regarding demographics, injury mechanism, radiographs, surgical procedures, outcomes and follow-ups were collected and analyzed. OUTCOMES: The CEH was observed in 49 patients (12{\%}), including 40 males and 9 females with a mean age of 33.7 years old. The posterior approach group included 301 patients (215 males and 86 females), with 13{\%} incident rate for CEH (40/301). The anterior approach group included 115 patients (80 males and 35 females), with 8{\%} incident rate for CEH (9/115). Forty-four patients (90{\%}) with CEH had neurological deficits; while other 5 patients (10{\%}) were neurologically intact but entrapments of a significant proportion of their cauda equina rootlets in the dorsal lamina fracture were observed during operations. Both vertebrae burst fracture and lamina fracture were observed in 95{\%} patients with posterior CEH (38 out of 40). LESSONS: Traumatic CEH were found in 12{\%} of the patients with thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures that were treated by surgery. Patients with a lumbar burst fracture showing neurological deficits in combination with a laminar fracture have an increased risk of traumatic CEH.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study we report here was to compare outcomes for temporary short-segment pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty and for such fixation without vertebroplasty. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective multicenter comparative study. PATIENT SAMPLE: We studied 62 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who underwent short-segment posterior instrumentation using ligamentotaxis with Schanz screws with or without vertebroplasty. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiological parameters (Cobb angle on standing lateral radiographs) were used. METHODS: Implants were removed approximately 1 year after surgery. Neurologic function, kyphotic deformity, canal compromise, and fracture severity were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: After surgery, all patients with neurologic deficit had improvement equivalent to at least one grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale and had fracture union. Kyphotic deformity was reduced significantly, and reduction of the vertebrae was maintained with and without vertebroplasty, regardless of load-sharing classification. Although no patient required additional anterior reconstruction, kyphotic change was observed at disc level mainly after implant removal with or without vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary short-segment fixation yielded satisfactory results in the reduction and maintenance of fractured vertebrae with or without vertebroplasty. Kyphosis recurrence may be inevitable because adjacent discs can be injured during the original trauma.},

A broad range of topics are presented to cover the full spectrum of the field. Degenerative diseases are discussed in a series of 3 articles on (1) pathophysiology, management, and surgical approaches to degenerative cervical myelopathy; (2) novel approaches to degenerative thoracolumbar disease (eg, interspinous process spacers, minimally invasive/endoscopic approaches); and (3) animal models and emerging therapeutics in degenerative disk disease. Also included is a unique study aiming to establish the critically important cost-benefit relationship for spine procedures with perspectives on how value is defined and how to address variability.Primary and metastatic spine oncology are reviewed with a focus on upcoming targeted biologics, subspecialized radiotherapy (eg, proton-beam, carbon-ion, stereotactic radiosurgery), genetic profiling to stratify risk, and morbidity-reducing surgical approaches (eg, minimally invasive/endoscopic resections, percutaneous instrumentation). Trauma is discussed in 2 high-quality papers on controversies in spinal trauma and neuroprotective/neuroregenerative interventions for traumatic spinal cord injury. A stimulating article on cervical, thoracolumbar, and pediatric deformity highlights the rapid evolution of deformity surgery with a look at innovative tools (eg, high-fidelity 3-dimensional reconstructions, magnetically controlled growing rods) and their impact on quality of life. Additionally, a must-read article on surgical site infections discusses key risk factors and evidence-based preventative techniques to remain aware of. Finally, cutting-edge technologies, including computer-assisted navigation, shared-control robotics, neuromodulation, novel osteobiologics, and biomaterials, are covered in detail in a series of 3 fascinating papers on the next generation of the field.Each section intends to highlight the salient literature and afford insights from multiple key thought leaders in an effort to minimize bias and provide varied perspectives. Overall, we hope this issue provides high-quality, evidence-based data relevant to trainees and practicing surgeons while also stimulating excitement about the future of spine surgery.},

abstract = {Management of spinal trauma is a complex and rapidly evolving field. To optimize  patient treatment algorithms, an understanding of and appreciation for current controversies and advancing technologies in the field of spinal trauma is necessary. Therefore, members of the AOSpine Knowledge Forum Trauma initiative used a modified Delphi method to compile a list of controversial issues and emerging technologies in the field of spinal trauma, and a list of the 14 most relevant topics was generated. A total of 45 440 manuscripts covering the breadth of spine and spinal trauma were initially identified. This broad search was then refined using the 14 categories felt to be most relevant to the current field of spinal trauma. The results were further pared down using inclusion criteria to select for the most relevant topics. The 8 remaining topics were classification schemes, treatment of vertebral compression fractures, treatment of burst fractures, timing of surgery in spinal trauma, hypothermia, the importance of global sagittal balance, lumbar subarachnoid drainage, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. These 8 topics were felt to be the most relevant, controversial, rapidly evolving, and most deserving of inclusion in this summary. In summary, despite recent advances, the field of spinal trauma has many ongoing points of controversy. We must continue to refine our ability to care for this patient population through education, research, and development. It is anticipated that the new AOSpine fracture classification system will assist with prospective research efforts.},

We studied the sagittal and frontal balance in a population with these injuries to determine whether mismatch in the pelvic and lumbar angles are associated with chronic low back pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with posterior pelvic ring fractures (Tile C1, C2, C3 and A3.3) that had healed were included. Foreign patients and those with an associated spinal or acetabular fracture or nonunion were excluded. The review consisted of subjective questionnaires, a clinical examination, and standing A/P and lateral stereoradiographic views. The pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), pelvic incidence (PI), measured lumbar lordosis (LLm), T9 sagittal offset, leg discrepancy (LD) and lateral curvature (LC). The expected lumbar lordosis (LLe) was calculated using the formula LLe=PI+9 degrees . We defined lumbopelvic mismatch (LPM) as the difference between LLm and LLe being equal or greater than 25{\%} of LLe. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were reviewed after an average follow-up of 8.8 years [5.4-15]. There were four Tile C1, five Tile C2, five Tile C3 and one Tile A3.3 fracture. Ten of the 15 patients had low back pain. The mean angles were: LLm 49.6 degrees and LLe 71.9 degrees (P=0.002), PT 21.3 degrees , SS 44.1 degrees , PI 62.9 degrees in patients with low back pain and LLm 57.4 degrees and LLe 63.2 degrees (P=0.55), PT 13 degrees , SS 43.1 degrees , PI 54.2 degrees in those without. LPM was present in 9 patients, 8 of who had low back pain (P=0.02). Six patients, all of whom had low back pain, had a mean LC of 7.5 degrees [4.5-23] (P=0.02). The mean LD was 0.77cm. DISCUSSION: The findings of this small study suggest that patients who experience low back pain after their posterior arch of the pelvic ring fracture has healed, have a lumbopelvic mismatch. Early treatment of these patients should aim to reestablish the anatomy of the pelvic base relative to the frontal and sagittal balance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze correlations between spinopelvic configuration and fracture pattern or location in traumatic vertebral fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The spinopelvic configuration represented by the pelvic incidence (PI) angle showed to have a strong correlation with the occurrence of degenerative diseases of the thoracolumbar spine. No data are available on whether there is an influence of the PI angle on traumatic vertebral lesions as well. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a consecutive series of patients sustaining traumatic vertebral fractures, we retrospectively analyzed spinopelvic computed tomography data sets of 197 patients (121 male and 76 female patients; mean age, 51 years). Measurements included the PI angle, level of fracture(s), and fracture type according to the AO classification. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate correlation between PI and fracture level and between PI and fracture type. RESULTS: An average of 1.6 fractures per patient was found in the 197 individuals included in our study. PI angle showed a mean of 50.6 degrees for the left hip and a mean of 49.9 degrees for the right hip. There were no significant differences of the PI angle between male and female patients as well. Neither a significant effect of the PI angle on the vertebral fracture level (P=0.64) nor a significant relationship between the PI angle and the fracture type according to the AO classification (P=0.52) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The spinopelvic configuration represented by PI angle seems to influence neither the level nor the type of vertebral fractures in trauma patients.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical and radiographic study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of vertebrectomy and expandable cage placement by a single-stage posterior approach for unstable mid and lower lumbar burst fractures (below the L3). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with unstable mid and lower lumbar burst fractures require surgical treatment to relieve pain, address paralysis, and stabilize the spine to prevent further segmental deformity. However, controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent single-stage posterior-only vertebral column resection and vertebral body reconstruction using an expandable cage. Neurological status was classified using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, whereas functional outcome was analyzed using a visual analog scale for back pain. Segmental Cobb angles were measured above and below the fractured vertebral body preoperatively, immediate postoperatively, and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: The preoperative neurological status was ASIA grade E in 2 patients, grade D in 5 patients, grade C in 2 patients, and grade B in 2 patients. Postoperatively, neurological stability was demonstrated in 3 patients (27{\%}), and 8 (73{\%}) showed improvement in the ASIA grade. The mean preoperative visual analog scale score was 8.3, which decreased to 4.5 postoperatively, and to 1.8 at the final follow-up. The mean preoperative segmental lordotic angle was 9.2 degrees, which increased to 16.9 degrees postoperatively, and decreased to 15.1 degrees at the last follow-up. The mean operating time was 208.8 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 1006.3 mL. Regarding surgical complications, 1 patient experienced a dural tear and 1 patient demonstrated cage subsidence. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this small series suggest the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of this surgical option for unstable mid and lower lumbar burst fractures. This technique from a single posterior approach offers several advantages over traditional anterior or combined approaches using strut graft or nonexpandable implants.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the association of dopamine-related genes with short-  and long-term neurobehavioral recovery, as well as neurobehavioral recovery trajectories over time, in children who had sustained early childhood traumatic brain injuries (TBI) relative to children who had sustained orthopedic injuries (OI). Participants were recruited from a prospective, longitudinal study evaluating outcomes of children who sustained a TBI (n = 68) or OI (n = 72) between the ages of 3 and 7 years. Parents completed ratings of child executive function and behavior at the immediate post-acute period (0-3 months after injury); 6, 12, and 18 months after injury; and an average of 3.5 and 7 years after injury. Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in dopamine-related genes (dopamine receptor D2 [DRD2], solute carrier family 6 member 3 [SLC6A3], solute carrier family 18 member A2 [SLC18A2], catechol-o-methyltransferase [COMT], and ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 [ANKK1]) were examined in association with short- and long-term executive function and behavioral adjustment, as well as their trajectories over time. After controlling for premorbid child functioning, genetic variation within the SLC6A3 (rs464049 and rs460000) gene was differentially associated with neurobehavioral recovery trajectories over time following TBI relative to OI, with rs464049 surviving multiple testing corrections. In addition, genetic variation within the ANKK1 (rs1800497 and rs2734849) and SLC6A3 (rs464049, rs460000, and rs1042098) genes was differentially associated with short- and long-term neurobehavioral recovery following TBI, with rs460000 and rs464049 surviving multiple testing corrections. The findings provide preliminary evidence that genetic variation in genes involved in DRD2 expression and density (ANKK1) and dopamine transport (SLC6A3) plays a role in neurobehavioral recovery following pediatric TBI.},

abstract = {Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) is among the most challenging complications of spinal cord injury (SCI). A recent report by us demonstrated an improvement in NDO in SCI rats following chronic systemic treatment with the purine nucleoside inosine. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of inosine underlying improvement of NDO. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent complete spinal cord transection at T8. Inosine (1 mM) delivered intravesically to SCI rats during conscious cystometry significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous non-voiding contractions. In isolated tissue assays, inosine (1 mM) significantly decreased the amplitude of spontaneous activity (SA) in SCI bladder muscle strips. This effect was prevented by a pan-adenosine receptor antagonist CGS15943, but not by A1 or A3 receptor antagonists. The A2A antagonist ZM241385 and A2B antagonist PSB603 prevented the effect of inosine. The effect of inosine was mimicked by the adenosine receptor agonist NECA and the A2B receptor agonist BAY60-6583. The inhibition of SA by inosine was not observed in the presence of the BK antagonist, iberiotoxin, but persisted in the presence of KATP and SK antagonists. These findings demonstrate that inosine acts via an A2B receptor-mediated pathway that impinges on specific potassium channel effectors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pediatric scapula fractures occurring in high-energy motorized vehicle accidents and their associated injury patterns in a pediatric patient population. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred sixty-eight pediatric patients who presented after either on-road or off-road motorized vehicle accidents between 1996 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-eight patients were found to have scapula fractures and the remaining 1930 were identified as controls. RESULTS: A total of 39 scapula fractures occurred in 38 patients. The most common pattern was the AO/OTA 14-A3 (n=32), followed by 14-A2 (n=5), 14-B1 (n=1), and 14-C2 (n=1). Scapula fracture patients experienced higher rate of spine fractures (42{\%} vs. 18{\%}, P=0.001), skull fractures (26{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P=0.02), rib fractures (40{\%} vs. 7.6{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001), clavicle fractures (34{\%} vs. 6{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001), and upper extremity fractures (58{\%} vs. 21{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001) compared with controls. Scapula fracture patients had higher Injury Severity Scores (22.1 vs. 10.8, P{\textless}0.0001), thoracic injury (79{\%} vs. 31{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001), intracranial hemorrhage (32{\%} vs. 15{\%}, P=0.012), pneumothorax (55{\%} vs. 8{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001), and lung contusion (63{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001). No difference in mortality was observed for scapula and control patients (5{\%} vs. 2{\%}, P=0.302). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric scapula fractures were not associated with higher mortality rates in this series but were associated with significant morbidity as demonstrated by high rates of associated intracranial hemorrhage, skull fractures, thoracic injury, upper extremity fractures, and spine fractures compared with control patients. Surgeons who care for pediatric trauma patients should view scapula fractures as an indicator for more significant injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Around 5{\%} of all trauma patients suffer from spinal trauma. Spinal fractures are mainly located in the thoracic and lumbar spine. For multisegmental vertebral fractures categorized as instable, combined dorsal instrumentation and ventral stabilization is recommended. Numerous vertebral body replacement systems are available for ventral stabilization. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to analyze radiological results following the implantation of a hydraulic expandable vertebral body replacement and the evaluation of patients' outcome three years after implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who suffered traumatic multisegmental fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine in the period from September 2009 to September 2012 were included in this study. Patients with additional injuries or abnormal sensitivity or motor function were excluded from the current study. All patients underwent dorsal percutaneous instrumentation. Afterwards, implantation of the vertebral body replacement was performed via the mini-open approach at our level I trauma center. In the computed tomography and Xray imaging, the sagittal kyphotic angle was measured. Furthermore, the clinical outcome (patients' satisfaction, VAS spine score) was analyzed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: During the above mentioned period, seven patients (four female; three male) underwent dorsal instrumentation and ventral trisegmental fusion and were identified fitting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and thus could be included in the study. Most fractures were located in the thoracic-lumbar junction and were categorized A4 according to the AO Spine classification system. The analysis of the radiological data showed a pre-operative average traumatic segmental angle of 18.1 +/- 14.9 degrees , which could be decreased by reposition procedure to 6.4 +/- 1.7 degrees . The complete follow-up, including the data three years after implantation of the vertebral body implant, was available for three patients. The traumatic segmental angle remained stable in the follow-up three years later. In one case, a subsidence of the implant of 1.5 mm was observed, having no influence on the patients' satisfaction. All three patients indicated to be very satisfied with their outcome. The VAS spine score rating was in the range between 62.4 and 70.2. CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that in the case of multisegmental fractures complete reposition by ligamentotaxis and by the percutaneous instrumentation system is possible. In addition to the percutaneous dorsal instrumentation, the implantation of a hydraulically expandable vertebral body replacement may allow a stable fusion after complex traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Patients are very satisfied with their outcome after this procedure.},

abstract = {Posterior pedicle screw fixation has become a popular method for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, it remains unclear whether additional fixation of more segments could improve clinical and radiological outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of fixation levels with pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Springer, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant randomized and quasirandomized controlled trials that compared the clinical and radiological efficacy of short versus long segment for thoracolumbar burst fractures managed by posterior pedicle screw fixation. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Based on predefined inclusion criteria, Nine eligible trials with a total of 365 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Results were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and standard mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95{\%} confidence interval. Baseline characteristics were similar between the short and long segment fixation groups. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding radiological outcome, functional outcome, neurologic improvement, and implant failure rate. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that extension of fixation was not necessary when thoracolumbar burst fracture was treated by posterior pedicle screw fixation. More randomized controlled trials with high quality are still needed in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subsidence and late fusion are commonly observed in anterior subtotal corpectomy and reconstruction for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. The subsidence rate of this surgical method was reported from 19.6{\%} to 75{\%} in the literatures, which would cause treatment failure. Thus, an improvement of anterior surgery technique should be studied to reduce these complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 130 patients of thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by minimal corpectomy, decompression and U cage, between January 2009 and December 2010 were included in this study. The hospital Ethical Committee approved the protocols. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale, visual analog scales, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used for clinical evaluation. The local kyphosis angle, vertebral height (one level above the fractured vertebral to one level below), canal stenosis, and fusion status were used to assess radiological outcome. All complications and demographic data such as number of male/female patients, average age, mode of trauma, burst level involved, mean surgery time and blood lost were reported. RESULTS: 120 patients were followed up for 24 months. Most patients had improvement of at least 1 ASIA grade, and all experienced pain reduction. The mean ODI score steadily decreased after the surgery (P {\textless} 0.01). Approximately, 83.3{\%} of patients achieved solid fusion at 3 months and reached 98.3{\%} at 6 months. The kyphosis angle and radiographic height were corrected significantly after the surgery and with a nonsignificant loss of correction at 24 months (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The average canal stenosis index was increased from 39{\%} to 99{\%} after surgery. No cage subsidence or implant failure was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes described here suggest that the selective corpectomy and rectangular cage reconstruction can effectively promote solid fusion and eliminate complications related to subsidence or implant failure.},

abstract = {Background: Flexion-distraction injuries (FDI) represent 5{\%} to 15{\%} of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Treatment depends on the extent of ligamentous involvement: osseous/Magerl type B2 injuries can be managed conservatively, while ligamentous/Magerl type B1 injuries undergo stabilization with arthrodesis. Minimally invasive surgery without arthrodesis can achieve similar outcomes to open procedures. This has been studied for burst fractures; however, its role in FDI is unclear. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the literature that examined minimally invasive surgery instrumentation without arthrodesis for traumatic FDI of the thoracolumbar spine. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched, and articles were screened using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines for patients with traumatic FDI of the thoracolumbar spine treated with percutaneous techniques without arthrodesis and had postoperative follow-up. Results: Seven studies with 44 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 19 patients with osseous FDI and 25 with ligamentous FDI. When reported, patients (n = 39) were neurologically intact preoperatively and at follow-up. Osseous FDI patients underwent instrumentation at 2 levels, while ligamentous injuries at approximately 4 levels. Complication rate was 2.3{\%}. All patients had at least 6 mo of follow-up and demonstrated healing on follow-up imaging. Conclusion: Percutaneous instrumentation without arthrodesis represents a low-risk intermediate between conservative management and open instrumented fusion. This "internal bracing" can be used in osseous and ligamentous FDIs. Neurologically intact patients who do not require decompression and those that may not tolerate or fail conservative management may be candidates. The current level of evidence cannot provide official recommendations and future studies are required to investigate long-term safety and efficacy.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture undergoing instrumentation between 2010 and 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. The degree of neurological injury was determined using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system. The association between the morphology of the fracture and the severity of neurological injury was analyzed. RESULTS: There was a strong association between fracture morphology and the severity of neurological injury. Of the patients, 77.5{\%} with SI {\textgreater}/=20 degrees , 81.6{\%} with CC {\textgreater}/=40{\%}, and 100{\%} with LVBH {\textgreater}/=50{\%} had lesion according to ASIA. All of 7 patients with ASIA A had SI {\textgreater}/=20 degrees , CC {\textgreater}/=40{\%}, and LVBH {\textgreater}/=50{\%}. On the other hand, 79{\%} of the patients with ASIA E had SI {\textless}20 degrees , 83.7{\%} of the patients with ASIA E had CC {\textless}40{\%}, and all of the patients with ASIA E had LVBH {\textless}50{\%}. SI, CC, and LVBH were lower in neurologically intact patients (ASIA E), whereas they were higher in patients with neurological deficits (ASIA A, B, C, D) (P = 0.001; P {\textless} 0.01). These measurements had 100{\%} negative predictive values and relatively high positive predictive values. CONCLUSION: SI, CC, and LVBH are significantly associated with the severity of neurological injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. The patients with SI {\textgreater}25 degrees , the patients with CC {\textgreater}40{\%}, and the patients with LVBH {\textgreater}50{\%} are likely to have a more severe neurological injury.},

abstract = {AIM: Conservative treatment is a frequently used treatment modality for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. However, not many studies evaluating radiological and clinical results of conservative treatment are found. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors, and compression and kyphosis rates after 1 year in patients with AO type A thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar fractures treated conservatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiological and clinical results of 79 thoracolumbar fractures in 57 patients, who were treated conservatively, were evaluated one year after trauma. Fractures were classified according to thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) score and AO spinal trauma classification system. Compression rate, wedge and kyphosis angles, and sagittal index were calculated in early and late periods after trauma. RESULTS: Female/male ratio was 25/32, and mean age was 41.7+/-16.7 years. They were followed for 15.2+/-4.9 months. Mean compression rates were 19.6{\%} and 25.2{\%}; wedge angles were 10.1 and 12.7 degrees; kyphosis angles were 5.82 and 8.9 degrees; and sagittal indexes were 8.01 and 10.13 in all patients just after trauma and after one year, respectively. Fractures in older patients ( {\textgreater} 60 years of age) and in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis, located in the thoracolumbar junction, AO type A2 and A3 fractures, and solitary fractures had higher compression and kyphosis rates at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Early mobilization without bed rest for stable thoracolumbar fractures according to the TLICS system is a good treatment option, and radiological and clinical results are usually acceptable. However, fractures in patients older than 60 years, those with osteoporosis or osteopenia, fractures located in the thoracolumbar junction, solitary fractures, and fractures in AO type A2 or A3, are more inclined to increase in compression and kyphosis and may require a closer follow-up.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous techniques have increasingly gained popularity in recent years. The application of technological innovation, including neuromonitoring techniques, has the potential to increase the safety and efficacy of these procedures. METHODS: Thirty patients suffering from osteoporotic dorsolumbar burst fracture were prospectively enrolled in this study. The patients underwent percutaneous fenestrated pedicle screw fixation augmented with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection. A novel surgeon-dedicated neuromonitoring device was used in order to increase the safety and the accuracy of the screw insertion. A second group of 30 patients who did not undergo neuromonitoring during percutaneous pedicle screw placement, matched for demographic characteristics, constituted the control group. FINDINGS: A total of 296 screws were inserted. All treated patients had a good outcome, documented by an improvement in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Excellent trajectories were achieved in all patients. Cobb's angle and anterior vertebral height were satisfactorily restored in all study group patients. Three misplaced screws in three patients and a case of PMMA leakage without neurological deficits were observed in the control group, whereas no complication was recorded in the study group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Neuromonitoring in cement-augmented percutaneous pedicle screw placement appears to improve surgeon confidence during surgery, reducing the risk of screw misplacement or cement leakage.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is still no general consensus about the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Recommendations depend on type of fracture, grade of instability, bone quality, and general conditions of the patient. Spontaneous fractures may be considered to be treated different compared to cases with high-velocity trauma. METHODS: According to the DVO, patients without trauma should first be treated conservatively. However, there is no more strict time protocol of 3 or 6 week conservative treatment before operations may be indicated. Surgical criteria are not yet distinctly defined. For highly unstable fractures (type B and C according to the AO Spine Classification), posterior instrumentation with cement augmented screws and as long construct, respectively, is adequate. Current literature has been analysed for diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: There is no clear operative concept for burst fractures and classic osteoporotic fractures with dynamic ongoing sintering. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation showed to prevent the fractures from ongoing kyphotic deformity and the patients from painful immobilization. Indications and results of classical vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been discussed intensively in the literature. Further development included special injection techniques, cements with different viscosities and stenting systems to reach more stable constructs and avoid typical complications, such as cement extrusion. CONCLUSIONS: This review reports upon indications and limitations of percutaneous vertebral augmentation and the potential development of classifications and therapeutic algorithms.},

Initially, a standardized diagnostic algorithm including magnetic resonance tomography is recommended to detect accompanied further vertebral body fractures, to interpret the individual fracture stability, and to screen for relevant traumatic intervertebral disc lesions. Aim of the therapy is to assure fast mobilization and to maintain spinal alignment. Unstable fracture morphology is defined by vertebral body fractures including a relevant defect of the posterior vertebral cortex as well as type B or C fractures. With respect of type A fractures, a combined anterior-posterior approach including a primary cement-augmented posterior stabilization and anterior spondylodesis is indicated in those patients with relevant intervertebral lesions or in those suffering from high-energy accidents resulting in unstable burst-type fractures. The others will benefit from hybrid stabilizations including cement-augmented posterior stabilizations and cement augmentation (kyphoplasty) of the fractured level to gain a ventral transosseous stability. In addition, individually adapted antiosteoporotic therapy is essential.},

abstract = {This article describes different types of vertebral fractures that affect the thoracolumbar spine and the most relevant contributions of the different classification systems to vertebral fracture management. The vertebral fractures types are based on the three columns model of Denis that includes compression, burst, flexion-distraction and fracture-dislocation types. The most recent classifications systems of these types of fractures are reviewed, including the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS) and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen Spine Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (AOSpine-TLICS). Correct classification requires a quantitative imaging approach in which several measurements determine TLICS or AOSpine-TLICS grade. If the TLICS score is greater than 4, or the AOSpine-TLICS is greater than 5, surgical management is indicated. In this review, the most important imaging findings and measurements on radiography, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are described. These include degree of vertebral wedging and percentage of vertebral height loss in compression fractures, degree of interpedicular distance widening and spinal canal stenosis in burst fractures, and the degree of vertebral translation or interspinous widening in more severe fractures types, such as flexion-distraction and fracture-dislocation. These findings and measurements are illustrated with schemes and cases of our archives in a didactic way.},

abstract = {Hyperuricemia is not only the main feature of gout but also a cause of gout-related organ injuries including glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Uric acid (UA) has been proven to directly cause mesangial cell (MC) proliferation with elusive mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to examined the role of inflammatory cascade of COX-2/mPGES-1/PGE2 in UA-induced MC proliferation. In the dose- and time-dependent experiments, UA increased cell proliferation shown by the increased total cell number, DNA synthesis rate, and the number of cells in S and G2 phases in parallel with the upregulation of cyclin A2 and cyclin D1. Interestingly, UA-induced cell proliferation was accompanied with the upregulation of COX-2 and mPGES-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Strikingly, inhibition of COX-2 via a specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 markedly blocked UA-induced MC proliferation. Meanwhile, UA-induced PGE2 production was almost entirely abolished. Furthermore, inhibiting mPGES-1 by a siRNA approach in MCs also ameliorated UA-induced MC proliferation in line with a significant blockade of PGE2 secretion. More importantly, in gout patients, we observed a significant elevation of urinary PGE2 excretion compared with healthy controls, indicating a translational potential of this study to the clinic. In conclusion, our findings indicated that COX-2/mPGES-1/PGE2 cascade activation mediated UA-induced MC proliferation. This study offered new insights into the understanding and the intervention of UA-related glomerular injury.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The spinal traumas are common and leading problem in orthopaedics practice. The individuals are at a risk of high energy trauma in modern era. Unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures are serious injuries of concern, if left untreated may result in marked morbidity and disability to the patient. Thoracolumbar is the second most common segment involved in the spinal cord following spinal injuries followed by cervical segment. The goal of treatment of any spinal injury is restoration of the patient to maximum possible function with disability free life. AIM: To analyse the outcomes of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures stabilized with short segment posterior instrumentation with transpedicular screws. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective interventional study consisted of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures carried out at Department of Orthopaedics, New Civil Hospital, Surat during Jan 2014 to Dec 2015. We stabilized the patients with unstable thoracolumbar spinal fractures with short segment posterior instrumentation by using the intermediate screw option in the fractured vertebra level as a method of augmentation. Patients were evaluated for maintenance of spinal correction and neurological improvement after short segment posterior instrumentation in unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. RESULTS: The mean age for males was 35.57 +/- 11.62 years and for females was 33.56 +/- 11.2 years. The most common vertebra involved in the study group was T12 (31.25{\%}). In the study, about 66{\%} patients had a fall from height as the mode of injury, whereas 34{\%} injuries were due to road traffic accident. In the study group, the mean regional angle observed during pre-operative stages was 16.0 degrees +/-5.1 degrees . There was a statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05) difference between pre-op and post-operative regional angles as well as anterior wedge angles. There was a statistically significant difference (p{\textless}0.05) in the vertebral height between pre-operative and post-operative stages. CONCLUSION: Short segment posterior instrumentation is a very stable implant construct in maintenance of deformity correction and fracture reduction along with the added advantage of sparing of the motion segments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transpedicular grafting techniques with posterior short-segment instrumentation have demonstrated to prevent high implant failure in unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. We tested our hypothesis that short-segment instrumentation with two additional augmenting screws in the injured vertebra could provide stability and was similar to those of the transpedicular grafting technique. METHODS: Twenty patients belonged to group A; treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation and reinforced by two augmenting screws at the fractured vertebra. Group B had thirty-one patients; the fractured vertebra was augmented with transpedicular autogenous bone graft. Group C had twenty patients; the injured vertebra was strengthened with calcium sulfate cement. Clinical outcome and radiographic parameters were compared. RESULTS: Group A had the least blood loss (101.7 +/- 72.5 vs. 600 +/- 403.1 vs. 247.5 +/- 164.2 ml, p {\textless} 0.001) and the least operation time (142.0 +/- 57.2 vs. 227.2 +/- 43.6 vs. 161.6 +/- 28.5 min, p {\textless} 0.001). However, group A had the highest collapsed rate of the body height at the 18-month follow-up (10.5 +/- 7.0 vs. 4.6 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.2 +/- 8.5{\%}, p = 0.002). The failure rate, include implant failure or loss of 10 degrees or more of correction, group B had the lowest failure rate (10{\%} vs. 3.2{\%} vs. 10{\%}, p = 0.542). The group A had the highest rate of return to their previous employment (50{\%} vs. 38{\%} vs. 35{\%}, p = 0.265). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with transpedicular grafting techniques, additional two "augmenting screws" in the fracture vertebra with short-segment instrumentation are sufficient for one-level thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Experts recommend aggressive management with continuous intravenous infusions or inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane. However, there is concern that MRI changes in RSE reflect isoflurane neurotoxicity. We performed a case-control study to determine whether isoflurane is neurotoxic, based on MRI signal changes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of the incidence of MRI changes in RSE treated with and without isoflurane. Charts were reviewed for demographic and treatment information. T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences of MRIs were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists blinded to treatment group for presence or absence of signal change or atrophy in the meninges, cortex, white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. RESULTS: Eight cases of RSE receiving treatment with isoflurane were identified and double-matched with 15 controls who received only intravenous anesthetics. Baseline characteristics were similar. Hippocampal signal change was observed more frequently in cases receiving isoflurane (p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal signal changes were associated with isoflurane use in patients with RSE. They were also associated with number of seizure days prior to MRI and the use of multiple anesthetic agents. Similar changes have been seen as a result of RSE itself, and one cannot rule out the possibility these changes represent seizure-related effects. If isoflurane-related, these hippocampal signal changes may be the result of a direct neurotoxic effect of prolonged isoflurane use or failure of isoflurane to protect the hippocampus from seizure-induced injury despite achieving electrographic burst-suppression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flexion injuries of the spine range from mild compression fractures to severe flexion-distraction injuries, that is, Chance fractures. Chance fractures are often unstable and Arkader and colleagues demonstrated improved outcomes when Chance fractures are treated operatively compared with those managed nonoperatively. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients treated over a 5-year period (2008 to 2013) for a flexion injury, either a Chance or a compression fracture, of the thoracolumbar spine at our tertiary pediatric level I trauma center. Patients were excluded if they had prior spine surgery or had a pathologic fracture. RESULTS: Of the 26 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 27{\%} (7/26 patients) had a Chance fracture and 73{\%} (19/26) had compression fracture(s). The mean age of the 7 patients with Chance fractures was 14.6 years (range, 13 to 16 y). In total, 71{\%} (5/7) of the patients with Chance fractures were initially misdiagnosed: (3 as compression fractures, 1 as a burst fracture, 1 as muscular pain) and 80{\%} (4/5) of these misdiagnoses were made by a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon. Average delay to correct diagnosis was 95 days (range, 2 to 311 d), with 57{\%} (4/7) of the patients having {\textgreater}/=1 month delay. These 4 patients with a Chance fracture and {\textgreater}/=1 month delay in correct diagnosis presented to our clinic electively with chronic back pain. None of the patients with Chance fractures had a neurological injury. Six patients with posterior ligamentous disruption were treated with surgical instrumentation and fusion. All Chance fractures occurred between the levels of T12 and L3. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric Chance fractures in this series were initially misdiagnosed (71{\%}; 5/7) or mistreated (14{\%}; 1/7) by neurosurgeons or orthopaedic surgeons. Mean time to the correct diagnosis was 3 months for the Chance fractures in this series. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measures of aortic occlusion (AO) for resuscitation in patients with  severe torso trauma remain controversial. Our aim was to characterize the current use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) and resuscitative open aortic cross-clamping (ACC), and to evaluate whether REBOA should be an alternative method to resuscitative open ACC. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study between 2004 and 2013 from a nationwide trauma registry in Japan. Participants were selected who underwent either REBOA or ACC. Their characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were analyzed to compare REBOA and ACC directly. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was mortality in the emergency department. Logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the outcomes between REBOA and ACC with adjustment for severity; 1:1 propensity score matching was also performed. RESULTS: Of the 159,157 trauma patients, 903 were eligible based on the selection criteria. Overall, 405/607 patients (67{\%}) who had REBOA died compared to 210/233 patients (90{\%}) who had ACC. Patients with REBOA had higher revised trauma score (RTS) (mean +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.2; P {\textless} 0.001) but higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) (median (interquartile); 34 (25) vs. 34 (20); P {\textless} 0.001), and higher probability of survival (0.43 +/- 0.36 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.30; P {\textless} 0.001) compared to those with ACC. REBOA had an odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital mortality of 0.309 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.190-0.502) adjusting for trauma and injury severity score using a logistic regression model (n = 903). Similar associations were observed adjusting for RTS (OR = 0.224; 95{\%} CI = 0.129-0.700) or adjusting for ISS (OR, 0.188; 95{\%} CI, 0.116 to 0.303). In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 304), REBOA was associated with lower mortality compared to ACC (OR, 0.261; 95{\%} CI, 0.130 to 0.523). Patients with REBOA had less severe chest complications than those with ACC (Abbreviated Injury Scale thorax, 3.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.8; P {\textless} 0.001), although physiological severity and backgrounds were similar in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent AO had a high mortality. REBOA might be a favorable alternative method to resuscitative ACC for severe torso trauma although some indication bias could still remain. Further studies are needed to elucidate optimal indications.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures undergoing instrumentation between 2010 and 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. TLICS and AO systems were compared based on patients" American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores and they were analyzed for their safety and reliability. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were studied. Neurological deficits were detected in 18 patients and the remaining 37 patients had normal neurological functions. All the patients with neurological deficits received {\textgreater} 4 points according to TLICS. There were 14 patients with incomplete spinal cord injury and all of them received {\textgreater} 4 points according to TLICS (p {\textless} 0.01). On the other hand; 8 of these 14 patients received 4 points according to the AO system. None of the 37 patients without neurological deficit received {\textless} 4 points of TLICS whereas 18 of these 37 patients received 3 AO points, to whom AO recommends conservative treatment despite the fact that they had unstable burst fractures (p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Recommendations of TLICS might be more reliable than those of AO particularly for guiding the surgical management of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. However, this conclusion needs to be verified with further multicenter prospective studies.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An ambispective analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the global prevalence of specific degenerative cervical pathologies in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) through detailed review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: DCM encompasses a spectrum of age-related conditions that result in progressive spinal cord injury. METHODS: MRIs of 458 patients (age 56.4 +/- 11.8, 285 male, 173 female) were reviewed for specific degenerative features, directionality of cord compression, levels of spinal cord compression, and signal changes on sagittal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and sagittal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). Data were analyzed for differences between sex using Chi-square tests and geographic variations using Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Spondylosis was frequently present (89.7{\%}) and was commonly accompanied by enlargement of the ligamentum flavum (LF) (59.9{\%}). Single-level disc pathology, ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and spondylolisthesis had a prevalence of approximately 10{\%} each. OPLL was accompanied by spondylosis in 91.7{\%}. Klippel-Feil syndrome was observed in 2.0{\%}. The Asia-Pacific region had more OPLL (29{\%}, P = 3 x 10) and less spondylolisthesis (1.9{\%}, P = 0.002). Females presented more commonly with single-level disc pathology (13.9{\%} vs. 6.7{\%}; P = 0.013), and males with spondylosis (92.3{\%} vs. 85.6{\%}; P = 0.02) and enlargement of LF (61.4{\%} vs. 49.1{\%}; P = 0.01). C5 to C6 was the most frequent maximum compressed site (39.5{\%}) and region for T2WI hyperintensity (38.9{\%}). T2WI hyperintensity more commonly presented in males (82.4{\%} vs. 66.7{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is the largest report on the prevalence and spectrum of pathology in patients with DCM. Herein, it has been demonstrated that degenerative features are highly interrelated, that females presented with milder MRI evidence of DCM, and that variations exist in the prevalence of pathologies between geographical regions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.},

abstract = {The intraosseous fluid sign (IFS) in chronic osteoporotic vertebral fractures is  attributed to fluid accumulation within non-healing intervertebral clefts. IFS can also be seen in acute traumatic fractures, not previously described. We hypothesize a pathophysiological mechanism for the acute traumatic intraosseous fluid sign (ATIFS) and its predisposition to dynamic fracture mobility with axial loading on upright radiographs. Retrospective analysis was performed of 41 acute thoracic and lumbar compression or stable burst fractures with both supine CT and upright plain films completed within 1 week of each other. The presence of an intravertebral cleft with fluid attenuation and vertebral body height loss was assessed on CT scans. Changes in the fractured vertebral body height and angulation were measured on upright radiographs. The ATIFS was identified in 18 (44{\%}) of the 41 acute fractures. Mean kyphotic angle increase was significantly greater (p = 0.000) for ATIFS fractures (8.2 degrees , SD +/-4.2) than fractures without ATIFS (1.6 degrees , SD +/-3.4). There was significantly greater mean anterior (p = 0.0009) and central (p = 0.026) height loss in ATIFS fractures (4.3 mm, SD +/-3.76 and 1.89 mm, SD +/-4.44, respectively) compared to fractures without ATIFS (0.59 mm, SD +/-2.24 and -0.52 mm, SD +/-2.01, respectively). The IFS can be seen in acute traumatic vertebral fractures and show dynamic mobility. These ATIFS fractures show statistically significant greater mean height loss ratio differences and have significantly greater changes in kyphotic angulation on upright imaging when compared to fractures without ATIFS.},

A total of 62 patients with Denis B TLBF with neurological deficiencies were included in this study between January 2009 and December 2011. Clinical evaluations including the Frankel scale, pain visual analog scale (VAS) and radiological assessment (CT scans for fragment reduction and X-ray for the Cobb angle, adjacent superior and inferior intervertebral disc height, and vertebral canal diameter) were performed preoperatively and at 3 days, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. All patients underwent successful PARF, and were followed-up for at least 2 years. Average surgical time, blood loss and incision length were recorded. The sagittal vertebral canal diameter was significantly enlarged. The canal stenosis index was also improved. Kyphosis was corrected and remained at 8.6+/-1.4o (P{\textgreater}0.05) 1 year postoperatively. Adjacent disc heights remained constant. Average Frankel grades were significantly improved at the end of follow-up. All 62 patients were neurologically assessed. Pain scores decreased at 6 months postoperatively, compared to before surgery (P{\textless}0.05). PARF provided excellent reduction for traumatic segmental kyphosis, and resulted in significant spinal canal clearance, which restored and maintained the vertebral body height of patients with Denis B TLBF with neurological deficits.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation (MIPS) combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) using calcium phosphate for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficits. METHODS: Between September 2011 and April 2013, a total of thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 50.73 years (range 40-63 years), who suffered from thoracic or lumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficits underwent the procedure of MIPS combined with PVP using calcium phosphate. The preoperative and postoperative pain assessment were evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). The Cobb angles and central and anterior columns height were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 27.54 +/- 2.47 months. The mean VAS significantly decreased from 9 (range 6-10) before surgery 2 (range 1-3) immediately after surgery and 1 (range 0-2) at 2-yearA follow-up. The Cobb angle was 22.58 +/- 1.70 degrees before surgery and 4.11 +/- 1.41 degrees immediately after surgery and 5.06 +/- 1.11 degrees at 2-year follow-up. The central and anterior vertebral body height decreased from 44.10 +/- 7.0{\%} and 49.76 +/- 6.43{\%} before surgery to 80.09 +/- 4.05{\%} and 93.31 +/- 1.87{\%} immediately after surgery, respectively. No significant changes in vertebral body height restoration were observed during 2 years follow-up after surgery. In addition, there were no instrumentation failure and complications in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that MIPS combined with PVP using calcium phosphate is a good choice for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficits.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The thoracic cage is an anatomical entity composed of the upper thoracic spine, the ribs and the sternum. The aims of this study were primarily to analyse the combined injury pattern of thoracic cage injuries and secondarily to evaluate associated injuries, trauma mechanism, and clinical outcome. We hypothesized that the sternal fracture is frequently associated with an unstable fracture of the thoracic spine and that it may be an indicator for unstable thoracic cage injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria for the study were (a) sternal fracture and concomitant thoracic spine fracture, (b) ISS{\textgreater}/=16, (c) age under 50 years, (d) presence of a whole body computed-tomography performed at admission of the patient to the hospital. Inclusion criteria for the control group were as follows: (a) thoracic spine fracture without concomitant sternal fracture, (b)-(d) same as study cohort. RESULTS: In a 10-year-period, 64 patients treated with a thoracic cage injury met inclusion criteria. 122 patients were included into the control cohort. In patients with a concomitant sternal fracture, a highly unstable fracture (AO/OTA type B or C) of the thoracic spine was detected in 62.5{\%} and therefore, it was significantly more frequent compared to the control group (36.1{\%}). If in patients with a thoracic cage injury sternal fracture and T1-T12 fracture were located in the same segment, a rotationally unstable type C fracture was observed more frequently. The displacement of the sternal fracture did not influence the severity of the concomitant T1-T12 fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant sternal fracture is an indicator for an unstable burst fracture, type B or C fracture of the thoracic spine, which requires surgical stabilization. If sternal and thoracic spine fractures are located in the same segment, a highly rotationally unstable type C fracture has to be expected.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to analyze the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of the new AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system in young Chinese orthopedic surgeons with different levels of experience in spinal trauma. Previous reports suggest that the new AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system demonstrates acceptable interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility. However, there are few studies in Asia, especially in China. METHODS: The AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system was applied to 109 patients with acute, traumatic thoracolumbar spinal injuries by two groups of spinal surgeons with different levels of clinical experience. The Kappa coefficient was used to determine interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility. RESULTS: The overall Kappa coefficient for all cases was 0.362, which represents fair reliability. The Kappa statistic was 0.385 for A-type injuries and 0.292 for B-type injuries, which represents fair reliability, and 0.552 for C-type injuries, which represents moderate reliability. The Kappa coefficient for intraobserver reproducibility was 0.442 for A-type injuries, 0.485 for B-type injuries, and 0.412 for C-type injuries. These values represent moderate reproducibility for all injury types. The raters in Group A provided significantly better interobserver reliability than Group B (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no between-group differences in intraobserver reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the new AO spine injury classification system may be applied in day-to-day clinical practice in China following extensive training of healthcare providers. Further prospective studies in different healthcare providers and clinical settings are essential for validation of this classification system and to assess its utility.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological results in patients with unstable Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by modified one-stage posterior/anterior combined surgery. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with unstable Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled in this study. The patients underwent one-stage posterior/anterior combined surgery with posterior instrumentation using pedicle screws and anterior monosegmental reconstruction utilizing titanium mesh cages. The mean follow-up period was 38.3 months. Clinical outcomes, radiological parameters, and treatment-related complications were assessed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years. The mean operative time and blood loss were 230 min and 645 ml, respectively. The VAS pain score was significantly improved after surgery, and the improvement was maintained until the final follow-up. In 23 patients with neurologic dysfunction, 20 (87 {\%}) patients had improvement after surgery. By the final follow-up, 27 patients had returned to work; 18 of the 27 patients returned to a similar job. The mean sagittal kyphosis was corrected from 21.2 degrees preoperatively to 2.5 degrees postoperatively, which increased slightly to 4.3 degrees at the final follow-up. Minimal subsidence and tilt of the titanium mesh cage were observed during the follow-up period. Solid bony fusion was achieved in all patients. One patient developed a posterior surgical site infection, which was resolved by antibiotic treatment and surgical debridement. CONCLUSION: Modified one-stage posterior/anterior combined surgery for Denis type B unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures can produce good clinical and radiological outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to identify the independent risk factors of neurologic deficit after thoracolumbar burst fracture. Traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine are the most common type of spinal column fractures. Many studies have attempted to determine whether neurologic deficit in such fractures is related to spinal canal stenosis or other parameters observed on axial computed tomography. However, this relationship remains controversial. METHODS: A review of the clinical data and axial computed tomography (CT) for 105 patients was performed. Neurologic deficit was classified according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification. Various preoperative CT parameters, including vertebral body compression, canal stenosis, sagittal alignment, and fragment reverse, were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification, canal volume, transverse canal diameter, median sagittal diameter, Cobb angle, compression ratio of the sagittal diameter, compression ratio of the cross-sectional area, and compression ratios of the anterior vertebral height (AVH), middle vertebral height (MVH), and posterior vertebral height (PVH) were significantly associated with severity of nerve injury (P {\textless} 0.05). However, flip angle and rotation angle of bony fragments were unrelated to severity of nerve damage. Multivariate logistic regression identified AO classification, compression ratio of median sagittal diameter, anterior vertebral compression ratio, and distance from the posterior margin to the vertebral body above to be independent variables associated with neurologic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The four CT parameters most strongly associated with neurologic deficit in thoracolumbar burst fractures are AO classification, compression ratio of median sagittal diameter, anterior vertebral compression ratio, and distance from the posterior margin to the vertebral body above.},

Methods While developing the AOSpine Sacral Injury Classification System, a survey was sent to all members of AOSpine and AOTrauma. The survey asked four yes-or-no questions to help determine the best way to handle controversial aspects of sacral fractures in future classifications. Chi-square tests were initially used to compare surgeons' answers to the four key questions of the survey, and then the data was modeled through multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 474 surgeons answered all questions in the survey. Overall 86.9{\%} of respondents felt that the proposed hierarchical nature of injuries was appropriate, and 77.8{\%} of respondents agreed that that the risk of neurologic injury is highest in a vertical fracture through the foramen. Almost 80{\%} of respondents felt that the separation of injuries based on the integrity of L5-S1 facet was appropriate, and 83.8{\%} of surgeons agreed that a nondisplaced sacral U fracture is a clinically relevant entity. Conclusion This study determines the global perspective on controversial areas in the injury patterns of sacral fractures and demonstrates that the development of a comprehensive and universally accepted sacral classification is possible.},

abstract = {Activation of RhoA/Rho kinase leads to growth cone collapse and neurite retraction. Although RhoA/Rho kinase inhibition has been shown to improve axon regeneration, remyelination and functional recovery, its role in neuronal cell death remains unclear. To determine whether RhoA/Rho kinase played a role in neuronal death after injury, we investigated the relationship between RhoA/Rho kinase and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), a lipase that mediates inflammation and cell death, using an in vitro neuronal death model and an in vivo contusive spinal cord injury model performed at the 10th thoracic (T10) vertebral level. We found that co-administration of TNF-alpha and glutamate induced spinal neuron death, and activation of RhoA, Rho kinase and cPLA2. Inhibition of RhoA, Rho kinase and cPLA2 significantly reduced TNF-alpha/glutamate-induced cell death by 33, 52 and 43 {\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Inhibition of RhoA and Rho kinase also significantly downregulated cPLA2 activation by 66 and 60 {\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA and Rho kinase reduced the release of arachidonic acid, a downstream substrate of cPLA2. The immunofluorescence staining showed that ROCK1 or ROCK2, two isoforms of Rho kinase, was co-localized with cPLA2 in neuronal cytoplasm. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay showed that ROCK1 or ROCK2 bonded directly with cPLA2 and phospho-cPLA2. When the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 was applied in mice with T10 contusion injury, it significantly decreased cPLA2 activation and expression and reduced injury-induced apoptosis at and close to the lesion site. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of RhoA/Rho kinase-mediated neuronal death through regulating cPLA2 activation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the procedure of posterior instrumentation and vertebroplasty for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture in youth and middle-aged patients is safe, practical and effective in short- and long-term. METHODS: A total of 50 patients aged 30-55 years old who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fracture complicated with incomplete paralysis or without neurologic symptom received surgery by using pedicle-screw implantation, reduction and bone cement filling through the unilateral or bilateral pedicles. The bone cement injection was conducted slowly and cautiously under monitor of fluoroscopy. Spinal canal exploration or decompression was performed regularly in follow-ups by X-ray films and CT scans. RESULTS: Cement leakage occurred in 5 cases without relevant symptom, including 1 case with leak from anterior aspect, 2 cases from lateral aspect, and 2 cases through ruptured end-plate into disc space. No spinal canal leakage or introvascular leakage was detected. The following-up duration was 5 to 10 years. There was no vertebral body height loss and regional kyphosis. The gaps within fractured vertebral body prior to surgery were disappeared completely. There was also no cement-bone interface detected. In 15 out of 50 cases, there were newly-formed bone bridges between fractured vertebral body and upper or lower adjacent vertebral body. There was no hardware failure occurred up to final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Bone cement filling combined with posterior instrumentation through pedicle-screw technique is a safe, practical and effective method for treatment of non-osteoporotic thoracolumbar spinal burst fractures without severe neurologic injury. The gaps among fracture fragments can be filled evenly and completely. Therefore, instant and permanent spinal stability can be achieved with excellent long-term result.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of short segmental pedicle screw fixation with and without fusion in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 57 patients with single segment thoracolumbar burst fractures, who accorded with the inclusion criteria between February 2012 and February 2014. The patients underwent posterior short segmental pedicle screw fixation with fusion in 27 cases (fusion group) and without fusion in 30 cases (non-fusion group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, time between injury and admission, fracture segment and classification, and neurologic function America Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification between 2 groups, which had the comparability (P{\textgreater}0.05). The operative time, blood loss, and hospitalization days were compared between 2 groups. The height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the range of motion (ROM) were measured on the X-ray film. The functional outcomes were evaluated by using the Greenough low-back outcome score and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain. The neurologic functional recovery was assessed by ASIA grade. RESULTS: The operative time was significantly shortened and the blood loss was significantly reduced in the non-fusion group when compared with the fusion group (P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found in hospitalization days between 2 groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). The patients were followed up for 2.0-3.5 years (mean, 3.17 years) in the fusion group and for 2-4 years (mean, 3.23 years) in the non-fusion group. X-ray films showed that 2 cases failed bone graft fusion, the fusion time was 12-17 weeks (mean, 15.6 weeks) in the other 25 cases. Complication occurred in 2 cases of the fusion group (1 case of incision deep infection and 1 case of hematoma at iliac bone donor site) and in 1 case of the non-fusion group (fat liquefaction); primary healing of incision was obtained in the others. The Cobb angle, the height of injured vertebrae showed no significant difference between 2 groups at pre-operation, immediate after operation, and last follow-up (P{\textgreater}0.05). The ROM of injured vertebrae showed no significant difference between 2 groups at 1 year after operation (before implants were removed) (P{\textgreater}0.05). The implants were removed at 1 year after operation in all cases of the non-fusion group, and in 11 cases of the fusion group. At last follow-up, the ROM of injured vertebrae in the non-fusion group was significantly higher than that in the fusion group (P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found in Greenough low-back outcome score, VAS score, and ASIA grade between 2 groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Fusion is not necessary when thoracolumbar burst fracture is treated by posterior short segmental pedicle screw fixation, which can preserve regional segmental motion, shorten the operative time, decrease blood loss, and eliminate bone graft donor site complications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of clinical use, in  vivo, on the torsional behavior of Reciproc and WaveOne instruments considering the possibility that they degraded with use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diameter at each millimeter, pitch length, and area at 3 mm from the tip were determined for both types of instruments. Twenty-four instruments, size 25, 0.08 taper, of each system were divided into two groups (n=12 each): Control Group (CG), in which new Reciproc (RC) and WaveOne Primary (WO) instruments were tested in torsion until rupture based on ISO 3630-1; and Experimental Group (EG), in which each new instrument was clinically used to clean and shape the root canals of one molar. After clinical use, the instruments were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy and subsequently tested in torsion until fracture. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance at a=.05. RESULTS: WO instruments showed significantly higher mean values of cross-sectional area A3 (P=0.000) and smaller pitch lengths than RC instruments with no statistically significant differences in the diameter at D3 (P=0.521). No significant differences in torsional resistance between the RC and WO new instruments (P=0.134) were found. The clinical use resulted in a tendency of reduction in the maximum torque of the analyzed instruments but no statistically significant difference was observed between them (P=0.327). During the preparation of the root canals, two fractured RC instruments and longitudinal and transversal cracks in RC and WO instruments were observed through SEM analysis. CONCLUSION: After clinical use, no statistically significant reduction in the torsional resistance was observed.},

abstract = {Plants depend on innate immune responses to retard the initial spread of pathogens entering through stomata, hydathodes or injuries. These responses are triggered by conserved patterns in pathogen-encoded molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the first responses, and the resulting 'oxidative burst' is considered to be a first line of defense. In this study, we conducted association analyses between ROS production and bacterial spot (BS; Xanthomonas spp.) resistance in 63 genotypes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). A luminol-based assay was performed on leaf tissues that had been treated with a flagellin 22 (flg22), flagellin 28 and a Xanthomonas-specific flg22 (flg22-Xac) peptide, to measure PAMP-induced ROS production in each genotype. These genotypes were also assessed for BS disease response by inoculation with Xanthomonas perforans, race T4. Although there was no consistent relationship between peptides used and host response to the BS, there was a significant negative correlation (r=-0.25, P{\textless}0.05) between foliar disease severity and ROS production, when flg22-Xac was used. This response could potentially be used to identify the Xanthomonas-specific PRR allele in tomato, and eventually PAMP-triggered immunity loci could be mapped in a segregating population. This has potential significance in tomato improvement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Timely interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans is of paramount importance in diagnosing and managing spinal column fractures, which can be devastating. Out-of-hospital, on-call spine surgeons are often asked to evaluate CT scans of patients who have sustained trauma to the thoracolumbar spine to make diagnosis and to determine the appropriate course of urgent treatment. Capturing radiographic scans and video clips from computer screens and sending them as instant messages have become common means of communication between physicians, aiding in triaging and transfer decision-making in orthopedic and neurosurgical emergencies. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to compare the reliability of interpreting CT scans viewed by orthopedic surgeons in two ways for diagnosing, classifying, and treatment planning for thoracolumbar spine fractures: (1) captured as video clips from standard workstation-based picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and sent via a smartphone-based instant messaging application for viewing on a smartphone; and (2) viewed directly on a PACS. STUDY DESIGN: Reliability and agreement study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty adults with thoracolumbar spine fractures who had been consecutively admitted to the Division of Orthopedic Surgery of a Level I trauma center during 2014. OUTCOME MEASURE: Intraobserver agreement. METHODS: CT scans were captured by use of an iPhone 6 smartphone from a computer screen displaying PACS. Then by use of the WhatsApp instant messaging application, video clips of the scans were sent to the personal smartphones of five spine surgeons. These evaluators were asked to diagnose, classify, and determine the course of treatment for each case. Evaluation of the cases was repeated 4 weeks later, this time using the standard method of workstation-based PACS. Intraobserver agreement was interpreted based on the value of Cohen's kappa statistic. The study did not receive any outside funding. RESULTS: Intraobserver agreement for determining fracture level was near perfect (kappa=0.94). Intraobserver agreement for AO classification, proposed treatment, neural canal penetration, and Denis classification were substantial (kappa values, 0.75, 0.73, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively). Intraobserver agreement for loss of vertebral height and kyphosis were moderate (kappa values, 0.55 and 0.45, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: Video clips of CT scans can be readily captured by a smartphone from a workstation-based PACS and then transmitted by use of the WhatsApp instant messaging application. Diagnosing, classifying, and proposing treatment of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine can be made with equal reliability by evaluating video clips of CT scans transmitted to a smartphone or by the standard method of viewing the CT scan on a workstation-based PACS. Evaluating video clips of CT scans transmitted to a smartphone is a readily accessible, simple, and inexpensive method. We believe that it can be reliably used for consultations between the emergency physicians or orthopedic or neurosurgical residents with offsite, on-call specialists. It might also enable rural orcommunity emergency department physicians to communicate more efficiently and effectively with surgeons in tertiary referral centers.},

However, their use is still limited to lumbar burst fractures mainly due to their difficulties in burst fracture reduction and decompression. Here we present a novel bio-inspired MIS device which can be used with an endoscope to reset the bone fragments retropulsed into the spinal canal within the wounded vertebral body. Its head jaw mimics the biomechanical characteristics of a crocodile rostrum to improve the performance in gripping and moving bone pieces in the confined space of a vertebral body.

In this study we present a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based thin-film device composed of layers of varying ratios of lactic and glycolic acid that elutes RvD1 unidirectionally to target tissues. The device demonstrated sustained release in vitro for 56 days with an initial burst of release over 14 days. The asymmetric design of the device released 98{\%} of RvD1 through the layer with the lowest molar ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid, and the remainder through the opposite side. We validated structural integrity of RvD1 released from the device by mass spectrometry and investigated its bioactivity on human vascular endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cells (VSMC). RvD1 released from the device attenuated VSMC migration, proliferation, and TNF-alpha induced NF-kappaB activation, without evidence of cytotoxicity. Delivery of RvD1 to blood vessels was demonstrated ex vivo in a flow chamber system using perfused rabbit aortas and in vivo in a rat carotid artery model, with the devices applied as an adventitial wrap.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the epidemiology of thoracolumbar fractures and associated injuries in blunt trauma patients. METHODS: A systematic review and metaanalysis was performed based on a MEDLINE database search using MeSH terms for studies matching our inclusion criteria. The search yielded 21 full-length articles, each sub-grouped according to content. Data extraction and multiple analyses were performed on descriptive data. RESULTS: The rate of thoracolumbar fracture in blunt trauma patients was 6.90{\%} (+/-3.77, 95{\%} CI). The rate of spinal cord injury was 26.56{\%} (+/-10.70), and non-contiguous cervical spine fracture occurred in 10.49{\%} (+/-4.17). Associated injury was as follows: abdominal trauma 7.63{\%} (+/-9.74), thoracic trauma 22.64{\%} (+/-13.94), pelvic trauma 9.39{\%} (+/-6.45), extremity trauma 18.26{\%} (+/-5.95), and head trauma 12.96{\%} (+/-2.01). Studies that included cervical spine fracture with thoracolumbar fracture had the following rates of associated trauma: 3.78{\%} (+/-5.94) abdominal trauma, 21.65{\%} (+/-16.79) thoracic trauma, 3.62{\%} (+/-1.07) pelvic trauma, 18.36{\%} (+/-4.94) extremity trauma, and 15.45{\%} (+/-11.70) head trauma. A subgroup of flexion distraction injuries showed an associated intra-abdominal injury rate of 38.70{\%} (+/-13.30). The most common vertebra injured was L1 at a rate of 34.40{\%} (+/-15.90). T7 was the most common non-junctional vertebra injured at 3.90{\%} (+/-1.09). Burst/AO type A3 fractures were the most common morphology 39.50{\%} (+/-16.30) followed by 33.60{\%} (+/-15.10) compression/AO type A1, 14.20{\%} (+/-8.08) fracture dislocation/AO type C, and 6.96{\%} (+/-3.50) flexion distraction/AO type B. The most common etiology for a thoracolumbar fracture was motor vehicle collision 36.70{\%} (+/-5.35), followed by high-energy fall 31.70{\%} (+/-6.70). CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the incidence of thoracolumbar fracture in blunt trauma and the spectrum of associated injuries. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first epidemiological road map for blunt trauma thoracolumbar injuries.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The use of intermediate screws in fractured vertebrae has been proposed to decrease the number of fused levels in thoracolumbar fractures and to enable short fixations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of this technique and to establish predictive factors involved in loss of segmental kyphosis correction (LKC). METHODS: Forty-three patients who underwent short-segment spinal fixation with intermediate screws for a thoracolumbar spine fracture in a two-year time period were enrolled in the study. Patients had AO-type A3, A4 and B2 thoracolumbar fractures. Radiological parameters included segmental kyphosis (SK), vertebral wedge angle (VWA) and loss of anterior and posterior vertebral body height. Patients were evaluated up to one-year follow-up. The correlation between LKC and potential risk factors, such as smoking habit, sex, age, neurological status and BMI was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean preoperative SK was 16.5 degrees +/-6.5 degrees , and it decreased to 3.4 degrees +/-3.5 degrees postoperatively (P{\textless}0.01). At the one-year follow-up mean SK dropped to 5.5 degrees +/-3.9 degrees (P{\textless}0.01). Mean preoperative VWA was 20.0 degrees +/-8.1 degrees , and significantly improved to 6.3 degrees +/-3.1 degrees after surgery (P{\textless}0.01). There was a mean LKC of 1.8 degrees +/-2.1 degrees at one year. LKC mildly correlated with body mass index (BMI, r: +0.31), and obese patients (BMI{\textgreater}30) had an increased risk of LKC at the one-year follow-up (P=0.03; odds ratio [OR]=3.2). DISCUSSION: Analysis of the radiological data at one-year follow-up showed that all the evaluated parameters were associated with a mild loss of correction, with no impact on the clinical outcomes or implant failure. These findings confirm the trends reported in the literature. The correlation between LKC and clinical features, such as BMI, age, sex, smoking habit and preoperative neurological status was investigated. Interestingly, a positive correlation was observed between BMI and LKC, and obese patients with BMI{\textgreater}30 had an increased risk of LKC at one-year follow-up (OR 3.2); to our knowledge this finding has never before been reported. CONCLUSION: Short-segment fixation with intermediate screws is a viable technique with positive clinical and radiological outcomes at one-year follow-up. However, surgeons should be aware that in obese patients (BMI{\textgreater}30) this technique is associated with an increased risk of LKC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of minimally invasive passage in posterior laminotomy decompression and intervertebral bone grafting combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Between January 2013 and March 2015, 53 patients with Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated by minimally invasive passage in posterior laminotomy decompression and intervertebral bone grafting combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. There were 37 males and 16 females with a mean age of 43 years (range, 16-57 years). The causes included falling injury from height in 23 cases, traffic accident injury in 15 cases, heavy pound injury in 7 cases, and falling injury in 8 cases. The time between injury and operation was 7 hours to 12 days (mean, 6.7 days). The involved segments included T11 in 2 cases, T12 in 7 cases, L1 in 20 cases, L2 in 18 cases, and L3 in 6 cases; based on the neurological classification of spinal cord injury by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), 3 cases were rated as grade A, 5 cases as grade B, 12 cases as grade C, 24 cases as grade D, and 9 cases as grade E. The operation time, bleeding volume, and postoperative drainage were recorded; postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation, and ASIA for neurological function assessment; CT and X-ray films were taken to observe fracture healing, bone fusion, and grafted bone absorption; The vertebral canal patency rate was calculated; the relative height of fractured vertebrae and Cobb angle were measured. RESULTS: The operation was successfully completed in all patients; the average operation time was 150 minutes (range, 90-240 minutes); the average bleeding volume was 350 mL (range, 50-500 mL); the average postoperative drainage was 80 mL (range, 20-150 mL); and the average VAS score was 2.3 (range, 1.5-4.7) at 3 days after operation. The incisions healed primarily. All the patients were followed up 12-19 months (mean, 15 months). All fractures healed at 3-9 months (mean, 6 months). No complications of broken nails, broken rod, and screw loosening occurred. At last follow-up, the vertebral canal patency rate was significantly improved when compared with preoperative value (t=27.395, P=0.000). The Cobb angle, and the anterior and posterior heights of of traumatic vertebra were significantly improved at 1 week, 1 year, and last follow-up when compared with preoperative ones (P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference between different time points after operation (P{\textgreater}0.05). The neurological function was improved in different degrees; 1 case was rated as grade A, 4 cases as grade B, 7 cases as grade C, 15 cases as grade D, and 26 cases as grade E, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative one (Z=-5.477, P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive passage in posterior laminotomy decompression, bone graft in the injured vertebrae combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is an effective method to treat Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures, which not only can fully decompression, but also can effectively maintain the postoperative injured vertebral height, reduce the postoperative failure risk of internal fixation and decrease operation trauma.},

abstract = {CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Patients who have experienced high energy trauma have  a particularly high risk of suffering from fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The detection of spinal injuries and the correct classification of fractures before surgery are not only absolute requirements for the implementation of appropriate surgical treatment but they are also decisive for the choice of surgical procedure. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: By the application of spiral computed tomography (CT) crucial additional information on the morphology of the fracture can be gained in order to estimate the fracture type and possibly the indications for specific surgical treatment options. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to provide valuable additional information regarding injuries to the discoligamentous structures of the spine. PERFORMANCE: Magerl et al. developed a comprehensive classification especially for injuries of the thoracic and lumbar spine, which was adopted by the working group for osteosynthesis (AO). This is based on a 2pillar model of the spinal column. The classification is based on the pathomorphological characteristics of fractures recognizable by imaging. The injury pattern is of particular importance. ACHIEVEMENTS: In spinal trauma a distinction is made between stable and unstable fractures. The treatment of spinal injuries depends on the severity of the overall injury pattern. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Besides adequate initial treatment at the scene, a trauma CT should be immediately carried out in order that no injuries are overlooked and to ensure a rapid decision on the treatment procedure.},

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction in the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture. Methods This is a retrospective study, based on medical records from the archives of the Fifth People's Hospital of Fudan University, from January 2012 to January 2015. The 49 patients with thoracolumbar fracture were treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction. The treatment plan was determined by the AO classification and the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity classification. Baseline data included patient demographics, mechanism of injuries, fracture level, and neurologic status. Kyphotic angle correction and vertebral body height (VBH) restoration were used to assess radiologic outcome. Blood loss, operative complications, hospital stay, and pain score on the visual analog scale (VAS) were used to assess safety and clinical outcomes. Result A total of 49 patients with 51 thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction. There was significant improvement in kyphotic angle correction (p {\textless} 0.05) and restoration of anterior vertebral height (p {\textless} 0.05) after each reduction procedure. These improvements remained statistically significant at the latest follow-up for restoration of anterior VBH (p {\textless} 0.05) and kyphotic angle correction (p {\textless} 0.05). The preoperative VAS score was 8.2 +/- 1.3, and the postoperative VAS score (3 days after the operation) was 3.5 +/- 0.7. Conclusion Percutaneous pedicle screw internal fixation technique combined with three-step reduction is a relatively safe and effective technique for treating selected thoracolumbar burst fractures, and it yields satisfactory results.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE: To study the different biomechanical property among fixed-axis, monoplanar and polyaxial screws in the static and dynamic tests. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Correction loss is a common phenomenon in the patients with thoracolumbar vertebral fractures who underwent the posterior pedicle screw fixation. The incidence varies with the kinds of fixation instrumentation used. There is higher incidence in polyaxial pedicle screws group than in fixed-axis pedicle screws. Monoplanar pedicle screws, which are mobile in the axial plane but fixed in the sagittal plane, can be a better fixation instrumentation for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in theory. METHODS: A total of 30 porcine spinal units (L2-L4) were used for the static and dynamic tests, which were randomized into six groups (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3). Static test was performed in A1, A2, and A3. In this test, fixed-axis, monoplanar, and polyaxial screws were performed in A1, A2, and A3, respectively. The ultimate load was noted after tested. In addition, dynamic test was performed in B1, B2, and B3, used fixed-axis, monoplanar, and polyaxial screws, respectively. Correction loss (head-shank angle shift and anterior vertebral body height shift) was obtained and analyzed in each mode. RESULTS: In static test, fixed-axis and monoplanar screws had significantly higher ultimate load than polyaxial screws (P {\textless} 0.05) and fixed-axis screws had a little higher ultimate load than monoplanar screws (P {\textless} 0.05). In dynamic test, correction loss was minimal in fixed-axis screws, medium in monoplanar screws, and maximal in polyaxial screws. However, the differences were statistically significant in all comparisons but not in the comparison of fixed-axis and monoplanar screws (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings from the current study suggest that monoplanar screws can significantly increase the stiffness in axial direction compared with polyaxial screws, and reduce the risks of correction loss. For thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, monoplanar screw is a better optional instrumentation for minimally invasive surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

METHODS: From April 2011 to April 2014, 32 patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fracture were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty and pedicle screw fixation. There were 13 males and 19 females, aged in ranging from 60 to 73 years old(averaged 65.6 years). All fractures were single thoracolumbar fracture and 4 cases located on T(1)(1), 9 on T(1)(2), 16 on L(3); and 3 on L(2). Cobb angle, vertebral anterior compression rate, vertebral posterior compression rate, spinal canal occupying ratio were compared, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) were analyzed before and after operation. RESULTS: The mean operation time was 65.7 min(ranged, 60 to 120 min) and blood loss was 25.2 ml (ranged, 20 to 50 ml). The operative incisions obtained primary healing. All patients were followed up from 12 to 48 months with an average of 20.6 months. Vertebral anterior compression rate and vertebral posterior compression rate were respectively corrected from preoperative (49.70+/-5.89){\%}, (17.36+/-4.11){\%} to (6.00+/-2.10){\%}, (5.48+/-1.65){\%} at 2 d after operation, and (6.06+/-1.57){\%}, (5.68+/-1.82){\%} at last follow up. Cobb angle and spinal canal occupying ratio were respectively corrected from preoperative (13.34+/-3.56) degrees , (22.77+/-5.83){\%} to(2.86+/-0.95) degrees , (5.02+/-1.93){\%} at 2 d after operation, and (3.04+/-0.94) degrees , (5.15+/-1.93){\%} at last follow up. VAS and ODI were respectively decreased from preoperative (6.84+/-0.88)points, (77.50+/-5.10){\%} to(1.94+/-0.72) points, (17.94+/-4.82){\%} at 2 d after operation, and (1.63+/-0.83) points, (15.63+/-5.19){\%} at last follow up. Cement leakage occurred in 3 cases. No internal fixation failure and intractable lower back pain were found. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty and pedicle screw fixation could restore vertebral body height, improve spinal canal occupying, correct kyphosis, relieve pain, improve life quality, and it is a safe and effective method in treating osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

Among them, including 22 males and 26 females aged from 55 to 72 years old with an average of 62.2 years old. The time from injury to operation varied from 8 h to 9 d(mean 4.5 d). According to Denis fracture classification, 35 cases were compression fractures and 13 cases were burst fractures. Nine vertebrae located on T(1)(1), 15 vertebrae on T(1)(2), 14 vertebrae on L(1), 7 vertebrae on L(2), and (3) vertebrae on L(3). Anterior vertebral body height, sagittal Cobb angle, sagittal index(SI), failure of internal fixation and recurrence of kyphosis were observed before and after operation. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 24 to 48 months with an average of 32.5 months. Operative time ranged from 60 to 140 min with an average of 85 min;blood loss ranged from 50 to 100 ml with an average of 75 ml. Before operation, at 3 d and 1 year after operation, anterior vertebral body height respectively was (56.4+/-2.6){\%}, (91.2+/-1.6){\%} and (86.9+/-3.2){\%}; sagittal Cobb angle respectively was(26.6+/-3.2) degrees , (6.2+/-1.0) degrees and (6.8+/-1.5) degrees ; SI respectively was(51.6+/-4.2){\%}, (90.2+/-5.9){\%} and (88.7+/-4.2){\%}; VAS respectively was(7.6+/-1.2), (2.8+/-1.9), (1.1+/-0.4) points. There were significant differences above items between before operation and at 3 d after operation, while no significance between 1 year and 3 d after operation. No neurologic damage, internal fixation failure and recurrence of kyphosis occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous short segment pedicle screw fixation with bone cement augmentation in treating single level thoracolumbar osteoporotic fracture has advantages of less trauma, and could effectively restore normal physiological load transmission of spinal, avoid failure of internal fixation and recurrence of kyphosis.},

METHODS: Fifty-six cases of thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated in our trauma center from October 2012 to October 2013 were included in this study. The fractures were classified by the anteroposterior classification, whereas the severity of intervertebral disc injury was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between the severity of intervertebral disc injury and the anteroposterior type of thoracolumbar fractures, whereas a chi2 test was adopted to measure the variability between different fracture types and upper and lower adjacent disc injuries. RESULTS: The Spearman correlation coefficients between fracture types and the severity of the upper and lower adjacent disc injuries were 0.739 (PU{\textless}0.001) and 0.368 (PL=0.005), respectively. It means that the more complex Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classifications are the disc injury is more severe. There was also a significant difference in the severity of injury between the upper and lower adjacent discs near the fractured vertebrae (p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In thoracolumbar spinal fractures, the severity of the adjacent intervertebral disc injury is positively correlated with the anteroposterior fracture type. The injury primarily involves intervertebral discs near the fractured end plate, with more frequent and severe injuries observed in the upper than in the lower discs. The presence of intervertebral disc injury, along with its severity, may provide useful information during the clinical decision-making process.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Growth hormone deficiency is considered the most important factor determining skeletal fragility in hypopituitary patients. Osteoblasts and chondrocytes express growth hormone (GH) receptor. Two GH receptor isoforms (GHRi) have been identified: they differ for the presence/absence of a protein fragment encoded by exon 3 of GHR gene. Consequently, three genotypes were identified: carriers of both the full-length proteins (flfl-GHR), carriers of one full-length protein and one deleted protein (fld3-GHR) and carriers of both deleted proteins (d3d3-GHR). This polymorphism confers a higher sensitivity to endogenous GH and to recombinant human GH (rhGH); its effect on bone metabolism and skeletal fragility is unknown. The aim of this article was to investigate the role of GHRi in predicting skeletal fragility in adult-onset GHD (AO-GHD) patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the association between the d3-GHR isoform and the prevalence of morphometric vertebral fractures (VFs) in AO-GHD. Ninety-three AO-GHD were enrolled. Forty-nine patients carried flfl-GHRi (52.7{\%}), and 44 patients (47.3{\%}) carried at least one allele of the d3-GHR isoform. Thirty-two VFs were documented. Fifty-seven patients underwent rhGH replacement therapy. RESULTS: Median age was significantly higher in fractured patients as compared to nonfractured ones; d3-carrier patients showed a lower VF risk as compared to flfl-GHRi (OR: 0.37, 95{\%} IC: 0.24-0.55, P {\textless} 0.0001). This finding was also confirmed in AO-GHD undergoing rhGH replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that d3-GHR may protect AO-GHD particularly when treated with rhGH from the risk of VFs.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Drug-eluting stents (DESs), have shown promising results in prevention of in-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The elevated level of leukotrienes (LTs) detected in injured arteries after PCI, together with the potential role of LTs in inflammatory cascades and structural alterations in arterial wall provides the rationale for development of therapeutic strategies for prevention of in-stent restenosis using LTs receptor antagonists. Montelukast (MK) is a selective cysLT1 receptor antagonist, with anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties, which has been used for treatment of various diseases. Here, we report on the fabrication of MK/PLGA particles by electrospraying, aiming towards the development of particle based coating of DESs. The electrosprayed particles incorporated with 3{\%} and 6{\%} w/w MK exhibited fairly spherical shape with smooth surfaces and narrow size distribution. Sustained release of MK for up to 40days was obtained for both formulations, with higher initial burst release and drug release rate for the particles with higher drug loading. The LTD4 induced proliferation and migration of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) by 35{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively, which was substantially antagonized using MK incorporated particles. Nevertheless, MK antagonism preserved the normal proliferation and migration of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Moreover, MK antagonism inhibited the LTD4 induced phenotypic transition of HCASMCs from contractile to synthetic type. The electrosprayed MK-PLGA particles can be employed as a coating for DESs to inhibit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia responsible for in-stent restenosis, yet preserve the healing rate of the stented vessel.

abstract = {Osteoporotic compression spine fractures have a different clinical course and outcomes when compared to spinal fractures occurring in the younger population. Only a few studies have investigated the risk factors for progressive osteoporotic compression spine fractures. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and radiological factors related to progressive collapse following acute osteoporotic compression spine fractures. We retrospectively identified all patients treated for thoracolumbar fractures in our institution between January 2008 and July 2013. Included cases were examined by plain radiographs and CT scans. For each patient we classified the fracture according to the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. The difference between initial and final height loss and initial and final local kyphosis was documented as height loss difference and kyphotic angle difference. The presence of old fractures and intravertebral cleft were also documented. The study included 153 patients, comprising 102 women and 51 men. The mean patient age was 68.9years. The mean length of follow up was 15months. A statistically significant correlation was found between patient age, final height loss, height loss difference and kyphotic angle difference. Height loss difference and kyphotic angle difference were significantly correlated to type of fracture according to the AO classification system. The height loss difference was 18.1{\%} in A1 type fractures, 27.1{\%} in A2 type fractures, 24.2{\%} in A3 type fractures and 25.7{\%} in A4 type fractures. During a minimum 3-month follow up of conservative treatment for acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, age and the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System were predictive factors for progressive collapse.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Besides a patient reported outcome measure, the AOSpine Knowledge Forum  Trauma aims to develop a new concept of a surgeon reported outcome measure (SROM) for spine trauma patients. This study aims to identify parameters that spine surgeons consider relevant to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients. METHODS: An international cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among spine surgeons from the five AOSpine International world regions. They were asked to evaluate the relevance of a compilation of 16 clinical and radiological parameters for thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients, both for the short term (3 months-2 years) and long term ({\textgreater}/=2 years), on a five-point scale. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Out of the 279 invited members of AOSpine International and the International Spinal Cord Society, 118 (42.3 {\%}) participated in this study. Of the 16 surveyed parameters, 5 were identified as relevant by at least 70 {\%} of the participants. Neurological status was identified as most relevant. In contrast, five parameters were not deemed relevant for any spine region or time period, except for comorbidity. Only minor differences were observed when analyzing the responses according to each world region, spine surgeons' clinical experience, or professional background. CONCLUSIONS: Including a large and representative sample of spine trauma experts, this study identified parameters to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients. The results form the basis for the development of a SROM for this specific patient population.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Resolvin D1 (RvD1) on inflammatory-state realted proteins and genes in the human primary umbilical vein endothelial HUVEC cells exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). METHODS: We analyzed the influence of RvD1 and/or BaP on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cytosolic prostaglandine E2 synthase (cPGES), glutathione S transferase (GSTM1) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein expression by Western blot. Additionaly, phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) activity, as well as AhR, CYP1A1, phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A) and prostaglandin synthase 2 (PTGS2) gene expression by qRT-PCR was studied. RESULTS: RvD1 down-regulates cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) and prostaglandin synthase 2 (PTGS2) gene expression in HUVEC cells exposed to BaP. Repressesion of COX-2, cPGES and overexpressesion of GSTM1 protein was noted after co-treatment with RvD1 and BaP. After incubation with RvD1 an increase of cPLA2 and a decrease of CYP1A1 activity was observed when compared to BaP treated alone endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that RvD1 can significantly contributes on vascular function and alleviates the harmful effects caused by BaP, which might potentially aid in the repair of the injured endothelium.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Classification methods that are currently being used for clinical decision making in thoracolumbar fractures, are limited by reproducibility and prognostic value. Additionally, they do not include kyphosis. As a posttraumatic kyphosis is related to persistent pain, it is of importance to determine a risk of posttraumatic kyphosis based on fracture type and patient characteristics. PURPOSE: To determine risk factors (AO classification, age, gender, localization) that may lead to progressive kyphosis after a thoracolumbar fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective radiographic analysis of a consecutive patientcohort that presented in our clinic with a traumatic fracture of the thoracolumbar spine between 2004 and 2011. Cobb angle, Gardner angle, vertebral compression angle and anterior vertebral body compression were measured on plain radiographs, direct post-trauma and at follow-up. RESULTS: Age and localization are not significantly correlated, but there seems to be an increased risk of progression of kyphosis in age {\textgreater} 50 years and fractures localized at Th12 or L1. A3 type fractures are significantly more at risk for posttraumatic kyphosis compared to A1 and A2 type fractures. 30-50{\%} of the A3 type fractures have an end Gardner angle and end vertebral compression angle of more than 20 degrees. CONCLUSION: AO-type A3 fractures appear to be at risk of progression of kyphosis. Localization at Th12-L1 and age above 50 years seem to be risk factors for significant posttraumatic kyphosis. These findings should be used in patient counseling and a meticulous evaluation by weekly radiographs is recommended to determine the treatment strategy of thoracolumbar fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: As war injury patterns have changed throughout Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OIF and OEF), a relative increase in the incidence of complex lumbosacral dissociation (LSD) injuries has been noted. Lumbosacral dissociation injuries are an anatomical separation of the spinal column from the pelvis, and represent a manifestation of severe, high-energy trauma. PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of combat-related LSD injuries at a mean of 7 years following operative treatment. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: We identified 20 patients with operatively managed LSDs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Time from injury to arrival in the United States, operative details, fixation methods, postoperative complications, time to retirement from military service, disability, and ambulatory status at latest follow-up. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of outcomes of all patients with operatively managed combat-related LSD from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2011. RESULTS: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria and were treated as follows: posterior spinal fusion (12, 60{\%}), sacroiliac screw fixation (7, 35{\%}), and combined anterior-posterior fusion for associated L3 burst fracture (1, 5{\%}). The mean age was 28.2+/-6.4 years old. The most common mechanism of injury was mounted improvised explosive device (IED, 55{\%}). On average, 2.2 spinal regions were injured per patient. Neurologic dysfunction was present in 15 patients. Three patients underwent operative stabilization of their injuries before evacuation to the United States. Four patients had a postoperative wound infection and two patients underwent reoperation. Mean follow-up was 85.9 months (range: 39.7-140.8 months). At most recent follow-up, seventeen patients were no longer on active duty military service. Eight patients had persistent bowel dysfunction and nine patients had persistent bladder dysfunction. Fifteen patients reported chronic low back pain. Seventeen were ambulating and five had documentation of running following surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of operatively managed LSD in patients currently reported. Our series suggests that combat-related LSD injuries frequently result in persistent, long-term neurologic dysfunction, disability, and chronic pain. Operative management carries a high postoperative risk of infection. However, a select group of patients are highly functional at latest follow-up.},

abstract = {Optimal treatment of injuries to the thoracolumbar spine is based on a detailed analysis of instability, as indicated by injury morphology and neurological status, together with significant modifying factors. A classification system helps to structure this analysis and should also provide guidance for treatment. Existing classification systems, such as the Magerl classification, are complex and do not include the neurological status, while the TLICS system has been accused of over-simplifying the influence of fracture morphology and instability. The AOSpine classification group has developed a new classification system, based mainly upon the Magerl and TLICS classifications, and with the aim of overcoming these drawbacks. This differentiates three main types of injury: Type A lesions are compression lesions to the anterior column; Type B lesions are distraction lesions of either the anterior or the posterior column; Type C lesions are translationally unstable lesions. Type A and B lesions are split into subgroups. The neurological damage is graded in 5 steps, ranging from a transient neurological deficit to complete spinal cord injury. Additional modifiers describe disorders which affect treatment strategy, such as osteoporosis or ankylosing diseases. Evaluations of intra- and inter-observer reliability have been very promising and encourage the introduction of this AOSpine classification of thoracolumbar injuries to the German speaking community.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this multicentre study was to determine whether the recently  introduced AOSpine Classification and Injury Severity System has better interrater and intrarater reliability than the already existing Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) for thoracolumbar spine injuries. METHODS: Clinical and radiological data of 50 consecutive patients admitted at a single centre with a diagnosis of an acute traumatic thoracolumbar spine injury were distributed to eleven attending spine surgeons from six different institutions in the form of PowerPoint presentation, who classified them according to both classifications. After time span of 6 weeks, cases were randomly rearranged and sent again to same surgeons for re-classification. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability for each component of TLICS and new AOSpine classification were evaluated using Fleiss Kappa coefficient (k value) and Spearman rank order correlation. RESULTS: Moderate interrater and intrarater reliability was seen for grading fracture type and integrity of posterior ligamentous complex (Fracture type: k = 0.43 +/- 0.01 and 0.59 +/- 0.16, respectively, PLC: k = 0.47 +/- 0.01 and 0.55 +/- 0.15, respectively), and fair to moderate reliability (k = 0.29 +/- 0.01 interobserver and 0.44+/0.10 intraobserver, respectively) for total score according to TLICS. Moderate interrater (k = 0.59 +/- 0.01) and substantial intrarater reliability (k = 0.68 +/- 0.13) was seen for grading fracture type regardless of subtype according to AOSpine classification. Near perfect interrater and intrarater agreement was seen concerning neurological status for both the classification systems. CONCLUSIONS: Recently proposed AOSpine classification has better reliability for identifying fracture morphology than the existing TLICS. Additional studies are clearly necessary concerning the application of these classification systems across multiple physicians at different level of training and trauma centers to evaluate not only their reliability and reproducibility, but also the other attributes, especially the clinical significance of a good classification system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of pelvic fractures in trauma patients is reported to be 3-8.2{\%}, with roughly half of these fractures being caused by high energy injuries with a potential for catastrophic hemorrhage and death. Indications for internal fixation of anterior pelvic ring are controversial. Because of fears of disturbing the pelvic hematoma and causing additional hemorrhage, open reduction and internal fixation of pelvic ring disruption is routinely delayed. In contrast to conventional surgery, percutaneous screw fixation is gaining popularity in the treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures mainly because of minimal soft tissue damage, less operative blood loss, early surgical intervention and comfortable mobilization of the patient. Fluoro-navigation is a new surgical technique in orthopedic trauma surgery. This study is to investigate clinical results of fluoro-navigation surgery in anterior pelvic ring fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2006 to October 2011, 23 patients with anterior pelvic ring fractures were treated with percutaneous cannulated screw under fluoro-navigation. There were 14 men and 9 women, with a mean age of 40.1 years (range 25-55). According to the AO and Orthopedic Trauma Association classification, there were seven A 2.1, two A 2.2, one A 2.3, six B 1.2, one B 2.1: 1, one B 2.2, one C 1.2, two C 1.3 and two C 2.3 types of fractures. Amongst these patients, 13 had posterior pelvic ring injuries, 8 had other injuries including urethral, lumbar vertebrae fractures and femoral fractures. All patients were operated when their general condition stabilized after emergency management. The mean time from injury to percutaneous screw fixation of the anterior pelvic ring fracture was 12 days (3-15 days). All the anterior ring fractures were fixed with cannulated screws by two senior surgeons. They were familiar with the navigation system and had gained much experience in the computer-assisted percutaneous placement of screws. RESULTS: A total of 32 screws were inserted, including 19 in the pubic ramis and 13 in the anterior acetabular columns. The average surgical time was 23.3 min/screw. The average time of X-ray exposure was 19.1 +/- 2.5 s/screw. The virtual images of fluoro-navigation were compared with real-time X-rays during and after the surgery. Compared to the final position of the screw, the average deviated distance was 3.11 mm and the average trajectory difference was 2.81 degrees . Blood loss during the operation was minimal (22.3 ml/screw). One screw (3.1{\%}) deviated out of the fracture site during the operation. No superficial or deep infection occurred. No patient sustained recognized neurologic, vascular, or urologic injury as a result of the percutaneous screw fixation. All fractures united at the last followup. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoro-navigation technique could become a safe, accurate, and fairly quick method for the treatment of anterior pelvic ring fractures. Standardization of the operative procedure and training are mandatory for the success of this procedure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effectiveness of percutaneous pedicle screw (PPS) guided with photoelectric navigation for thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: Between May 2013 and June 2015, the clinical data of 39 patients with thoracolumbar fractures in accordance with the selection criteria were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into photoelectric navigation PPS group (trial group, 20 cases) and C-arm X-ray guidance PPS group (control group, 19 cases). There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury cause, fracture vertebrae, AO classification, operation time after injury, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and vertebral compression ratio (VCR) between 2 groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The operation time, bleeding amount, perspective times, VAS score, and one-time success rate (OSR) of screw placement were recorded; VCR and endplate-screw angle (ESA) were measured; and pedicle-screw relationship (PSR) was assessed by Ringel's method in radiographic result. RESULTS: Differences in operation time and bleeding amount were not significant between 2 groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05); perspective times of control group was significantly more than t hat of trial group (t=-15.658, P=0.000). The OSR of trial group (95.60{\%}, 87/91) was significantly better than that of control group (86.75{\%}, 72/83) (chi(2)=4.323, P=0.038). The patients were followed up 6-11 months (mean, 7.6 months) in trial group, and 7-11 months (mean, 7.8 months) in control group. No neurovascular complications associated with screw insertion occurred. Difference was not significant in VAS score at 7 days and 6 months after operation between 2 groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but VAS scores at 7 days and 6 months were significantly improved when compared with preoperative score in 2 groups (P {\textless} 0.05), and significant difference in VAS score was shown between at 7 days and 6 months in 2 groups (P {\textless} 0.05). VCR of trial group and control group were significantly improved to 94.75{\%}+/-5.10{\%} and 92.40{\%}+/-5.09{\%} at 6 months after operation from preoperative 71.97{\%}+/-5.66{\%} and 73.50{\%}+/-5.97{\%} (t=11.865, P=0.000; t=11.359, P=0.000), but there was no significant difference between 2 groups (t=1.442, P=0.158). ESA of trial group and control group were (1.82+/-1.13) degrees and (3.36+/-2.43) degrees at 6 months after operation, showing significant difference (t=5.421, P=0.000). At 6 months after operation, according to PSR classification, 83 screws rated as grade I, 6 as grade II, and 2 as grade III, and excellent and good rate of screw replacement was 97.80{\%} in trial group; 54 screws were rated as grade I, 19 as grade II, 7 as grade III, and 3 as grade IV, and excellent and good rate of screw replacement was 87.95{\%} in control group; difference was significant between 2?groups (chi(2)=18.347, P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Application of photoelectric navigation can guide screws placement by the two-dimensional multi pl ane dynamic image, has better accuracy of screws position in thoracolumbar fractures, reduces the introperative X-ray perspective times, maintains good reduction of vertebral body, and achieves satisfactory effectiveness.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although imaging has a major role in evaluation and management of thoracolumbar spinal trauma by spine surgeons, the exact role of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to radiographs for fracture classification and surgical decision-making is unclear. METHODS: Spine surgeons (n = 41) from around the world classified 30 thoracolumbar fractures. The cases were presented in a three-step approach: first plain radiographs, followed by CT and MRI images. Surgeons were asked to classify according to the AOSpine classification system and choose management in each of the three steps. RESULTS: Surgeons correctly classified 43.4 {\%} of fractures with plain radiographs alone; after, additionally, evaluating CT and MRI images, this percentage increased by further 18.2 and 2.2 {\%}, respectively. AO type A fractures were identified in 51.7 {\%} of fractures with radiographs, while the number of type B fractures increased after CT and MRI. The number of type C fractures diagnosed was constant across the three steps. Agreement between radiographs and CT was fair for A-type (k = 0.31), poor for B-type (k = 0.19), but it was excellent between CT and MRI (k {\textgreater} 0.87). CT and MRI had similar sensitivity in identifying fracture subtypes except that MRI had a higher sensitivity (56.5 {\%}) for B2 fractures (p {\textless} 0.001). The need for surgical fixation was deemed present in 72 {\%} based on radiographs alone and increased to 81.7 {\%} with CT images (p {\textless} 0.0001). The assessment for need of surgery did not change after an MRI (p = 0.77). CONCLUSION: For accurate classification, radiographs alone were insufficient except for C-type injuries. CT is mandatory for accurately classifying thoracolumbar fractures. Though MRI did confer a modest gain in sensitivity in B2 injuries, the study does not support the need for routine MRI in patients for classification, assessing instability or need for surgery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess, by the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), if a relationship exists between disc ADC and MR findings of adjacent disc degeneration after thoracolumbar fractures treated by anatomic reduction using vertebral augmentation (VAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty non-consecutive patients (mean age 50.7 years; range 45-56) treated because of vertebral fractures, were included in this study. There were 10 A3.1 and 10 A1.2 fractures (AO classification). Surgical treatment using VAP was applied in 14 cases, and conservative in 6 patients. MRI T2-weighted images and mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the intervertebral disc adjacent to the fractured segment were performed after a mean follow-up of 32 months. A total of 60 discs, 3 per patient, were analysed: infra-adjacent, supra-adjacent and a control disc one level above the supra-adjacent. RESULTS: No differences between patients surgically treated and those following a conservative protocol regarding the average ADC values obtained in the 20 control discs analysed were found. Considering all discs, average ADC in the supra-adjacent level was lower than in the infra-adjacent (1.35 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.53 +/- 0.06; p {\textless} 0.001). Average ADC values of the discs used as a control were similar to those of the infra-adjacent level (1.54 +/- 0.06). Compared to surgically treated patients, discs at the supra-adjacent fracture level showed statistically significant lower values in cases treated conservatively (p {\textless} 0.001). The variation in the delay of surgery had no influence on the average values of ADC at any of the measured levels. CONCLUSIONS: ADC measurements of the supra-adjacent discs after a mean follow-up of 32 months following thoracolumbar fractures, showed that restoration of the vertebral collapse by minimally invasive VAP prevents posttraumatic disc degeneration.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of radiographs, clinical charts, and health  questionnaires of 40 patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the radiologic and functional results of unstable thoracolumbar fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). A SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although earlier publications report a risk of correction loss or material failure after short-segment fixation in unstable thoracolumbar fractures, more current data suggest that improvements in this technique could offer good clinical and radiologic results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 40 patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures treated with SSPI. Radiographs and computed tomogrphic scans were analyzed to determine fracture classification and sagittal plane deformity, estimated by the Cobb method. The rates of final kyphosis and correction loss and their relationship with the Load Sharing Classification (LSC) and the AO classification were analyzed. We reviewed the hospital charts to identify complications and outcomes. At the final follow-up, the Short-Form 36 health survey was carried out to evaluate the functional outcome. The relationship between conditions such as polytrauma, neurological compromise or fracture site, and radiological and functional outcomes was also analyzed. RESULTS: We observed mean values of 5.9 degrees of final follow-up kyphosis and 5.1 degrees of correction loss. One case of material failure was seen. The severity in the LSC or the AO classification, polytrauma, neurological compromise, or fracture site had no relationship with worse radiologic or functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: SSPI shows good results in fracture reduction, with good functional outcomes despite the loss of correction seen at the final follow-up. Although no investigated variable was found to be predictive of radiographic failure, a trend was identified (P=0.07) that patients with a higher LSC had an increased loss of correction.},

A total of 39 patients (mean age: 32.6 +/- 12.4 years) with acute and chronic PCL instabilities received a single-bundle all-inside arthroscopic tibial inlay reconstruction with quadriceps tendon autograft and were available for clinical follow-up on average after 3.8 +/- 1.8 years. Assessment was conducted utilizing visual analogue scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, Lysholm, and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome (KOOS) scores. VAS, Tegner, Lysholm, and subjective IKDC-scores averaged to 2.75 +/- 1.95, 4 (1-9), 77.19 +/- 17.54, and 75.18 +/- 19.29 points, respectively. Mean KOOS results were 80.66 +/- 1.98 for pain, 74.72 +/- 17.72 for symptoms, 88.44 +/- 13.95 for activities of daily life, 65.35 +/- 27.96 for sports and recreation, and 60.01 +/- 25.36 for quality of life. Overall IKDC-score rating was A2, B28, C5, and D4. The overall complication rate of 5.4{\%} was caused by one superficial infection, one patellar fracture, and one lesion to the popliteal artery. Arthroscopic tibial inlay reconstruction is a valuable procedure regarding medium-term subjective and objective outcome measures. Return to sports, subjective satisfaction, and objective stability are predictable. The complication rate is acceptable but particular precaution is recommended to protect the popliteal artery and adjacent structures at risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Following a thoracolumbar burst fracture (TCBF), anterior screw-rods apply pressure upon the graft site. However, there is limited evidence comparing single screw-rod anterior instrumentation (SSRAI) to double screw-rod anterior instrumentation (DSRAI) for TCBFs. Our objective was to compare SSRAI versus DSRAI for TCBFs with incomplete neurological deficit. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 51 participants with T11-L2 TCBFs (AO classification: A3) were randomly assigned to receive SSRAI or DSRAI. Key preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the independent factors associated with inferior clinical outcomes, as well as the comparative efficacy of SSRAI and DSRAI. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the key demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups (all p{\textgreater}0.05). Smoking status was significantly associated with inferior three-month and six-month Denis pain scores (Wald statistic=4.246, p=0.039). Both SSRAI and DSRAI were significantly effective in improving three-month and six-month postoperative degree of kyphosis, three-month and six-month postoperative ASIA impairment scale scores, three-month and six-month postoperative Denis pain score, and three-month and six-month postoperative Denis work score (all p{\textless}0.001). Although there were no significant differences between DSRAI and SSRAI with respect to all outcomes (all p{\textgreater}0.05), DSRAI displayed significantly longer operating times, as well as significantly larger operative blood losses (both p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS SSRAI may be preferable over DSRAI for TCBFs with incomplete neurological deficit due to its lower operating time and amount of operative blood loss.},

abstract = {Study Design Survey of 100 worldwide spine surgeons. Objective To develop a spine injury score for the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. Methods Each respondent was asked to numerically grade the severity of each variable of the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. Using the results, as well as limited input from the AOSpine Trauma Knowledge Forum, the Thoracolumbar AOSpine Injury Score was developed. Results Beginning with 1 point for A1, groups A, B, and C were consecutively awarded an additional point (A1, 1 point; A2, 2 points; A3, 3 points); however, because of a significant increase in the severity between A3 and A4 and because the severity of A4 and B1 was similar, both A4 and B1 were awarded 5 points. An uneven stepwise increase in severity moving from N0 to N4, with a substantial increase in severity between N2 (nerve root injury with radicular symptoms) and N3 (incomplete spinal cord injury) injuries, was identified. Hence, each grade of neurologic injury was progressively given an additional point starting with 0 points for N0, and the substantial difference in severity between N2 and N3 injuries was recognized by elevating N3 to 4 points. Finally, 1 point was awarded to the M1 modifier (indeterminate posterolateral ligamentous complex injury). Conclusion The Thoracolumbar AOSpine Injury Score is an easy-to-use, data-driven metric that will allow for the development of a surgical algorithm to accompany the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of unilateral fractured vertebral pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture. METHODS: Eighteen fresh calf thoracolumbar spine specimens (T11-L3) were obtained to establish the L1 burst fracture models with Panjabi's high speed trauma apparatus, and were divided into 3 groups:pedicle fixation for adjacent upper and lower vertebrae of fractured vertebra (4 pedicle screws in group A), combined with pedicle screw fixation for unilateral fractured vertebrae (5 pedicle screws in group B), and three-level 6 pedicle fixation (group C). Under normal, fractured, and reconstructed conditions, the range of motion (ROM) of adjacent upper and lower vertebrae of fractured vertebra were measured in flexion, extension, bilateral bending, and axial rotation. Axial stiffness under flexion-compression was measured on the MTS-858 testing system. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in ROM and axial stiffness under normal and fractured conditions in all directions among groups (P{\textless}0.05), indicating load balance in the groups. ROM of groups B and C were significantly less than that of group A under reconstructed condition in all directions (P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found between group B and group C (P{\textgreater}0.05). Biomechanical test showed that group B was significantly higher than group A in the axial stiffness value (P{\textless}0.05), but difference was not significant between group B and group C (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular fixation of fractured vertebrae can enhance the stability of the spine. Both unilateral and bilateral fractured vertebral pedicle screw fixations have the same stability.},

abstract = {Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with many consequences  and no known effective treatment. Although it is quite easy to diagnose traumatic SCI, the assessment of injury severity and projection of disease progression or recovery are often challenging, as no consensus biomarkers have been clearly identified. Here rats were subjected to experimental moderate or severe thoracic SCI. At 24h and 7d postinjury, spinal cord segment caudal to injury center versus sham samples was harvested and subjected to differential proteomic analysis. Cationic/anionic-exchange chromatography, followed by 1D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was used to reduce protein complexity. A reverse phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomic platform was then utilized to identify proteome changes associated with SCI. Twenty-two and 22 proteins were up-regulated at 24 h and 7 day after SCI, respectively; whereas 19 and 16 proteins are down-regulated at 24 h and 7 day after SCI, respectively, when compared with sham control. A subset of 12 proteins were identified as candidate SCI biomarkers - TF (Transferrin), FASN (Fatty acid synthase), NME1 (Nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1), STMN1 (Stathmin 1), EEF2 (Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2), CTSD (Cathepsin D), ANXA1 (Annexin A1), ANXA2 (Annexin A2), PGM1 (Phosphoglucomutase 1), PEA15 (Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15), GOT2 (Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2), and TPI-1 (Triosephosphate isomerase 1), data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003473. In addition, Transferrin, Cathepsin D, and TPI-1 and PEA15 were further verified in rat spinal cord tissue and/or CSF samples after SCI and in human CSF samples from moderate/severe SCI patients. Lastly, a systems biology approach was utilized to determine the critical biochemical pathways and interactome in the pathogenesis of SCI. Thus, SCI candidate biomarkers identified can be used to correlate with disease progression or to identify potential SCI therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modic changes are the MRI signal changes of degenerative lumbar vertebral endplate and which lead to or accelerate intervertebral disc degeneration. NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, such as osteoarthritis. However, the roles of IL-1beta and its activators caspase-1 and NLRP3 are unclear in the degenerative endplate. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) What are the degenerative changes of the histologic features and chondrogenic markers' gene expressions between the cartilaginous endplates of patients with Modic changes and trauma (control)? (2) How does the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1beta axis in the cartilaginous endplates of patients with Modic changes compare with control (trauma) specimens? METHODS: Surgical specimens of cartilaginous endplates were divided into Modic changes (n = 56) and the trauma control (n = 16) groups. Hematoxylin and eosin and safranin O staining of cartilaginous endplate tissues were done to evaluate the extracellular matrix. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed on these tissues to investigate mRNA expression of type II collagen (Col II), SOX-9, matrix metalloproteinase-3, and a disintegrin like and metalloproteinase thrombospondin type I motifs-5. NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1beta were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin and safranin O staining showed the extracellular matrix degraded in the cartilaginous endplates of patients with Modic changes but not in the control cartilaginous endplates. Chondrogenic Col II (p = 0.024) and SOX9 (p = 0.053) were downregulated in the Modic changes group compared with the control group. In contrast to the control group, the transcriptional levels of NLRP3 (p {\textless} 0.001), caspase-1 (p = 0.054), and IL-1beta (p = 0.001) were all upregulated in the Modic changes group. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1beta was upregulated in the patients with low back pain and Modic changes on MRI compared with patients with vertebral burst fracture without degenerative changes on MRI. The data suggest the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1beta axis may be implicated in lumbar cartilaginous endplate degeneration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1beta axis is active in cartilaginous endplates of patients with Modic changes and inflammatory cascades can exacerbate the cartilaginous endplate degeneration which may act as a trigger for intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain. If these findings can be confirmed by others, we hope that new and effective therapy could be developed directed against this target.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the surgical  technique and learning curve for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for treating thoracolumbar junction burst fractures and bony tumors by examining surgical data and outcome for the first 30 VATS procedures performed by a single surgeon at a training institution. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VATS is commonly used in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. Widespread use of this technique among neurosurgeons is limited by the lack of cases and the steep learning curve. METHODS: This study was a retrospective case series of the first 30 T12 and L1 thoracoscopic vertebrectomies from 2003 to 2008. The sample was limited to 1 surgeon and 1 region of the spine to minimize the potential variation so that a learning curve could be assessed. Surgical data and outcomes were analyzed. Estimated blood loss and operation time were analyzed using a linear generalized estimating equation model with a first-order autoregression correlation structure. RESULTS: The average operative time for thoracoscopic corpectomy was 270+/-65 minutes (range, 160-416 min). Operating room time decreased significantly after the first 3 operations. The authors observed a stable linear decrease in operating time over the course of the study. The average blood loss during the thoracoscopic procedure was 433+/-330 mL (range, 100-1500 mL) and did not change as the series progressed. Complications and conversions to open procedures occurred in 2 patients and were evenly distributed throughout the series. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic vertebrectomy at the thoracolumbar junction has a relatively long learning curve. In this series, operating room time improved dramatically after the first 3 cases but continued to improve subsequently. The learning curve can be accomplished without an increase in blood loss, complications, rate of conversion to open procedures, or frequency of misplaced instrumentation.},

abstract = {Treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. Long-segment pedicle screw constructs may be stiffer and impart greater forces on adjacent segments compared with short-segment constructs, which may affect clinical performance and long-term out come. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically evaluate long-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation (LSPF) vs short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation (SSPF) for unstable burst fractures. Six unembalmed human thoracolumbar spine specimens (T10-L4) were used. Following intact testing, a simulated L1 burst fracture was created and sequentially stabilized using 5.5-mm titanium polyaxial pedicle screws and rods for 4 different constructs: SSPF (1 level above and below), SSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level), LSPF (2 levels above and below), and LSPF+L1 (pedicle screw at fractured level). Each fixation construct was tested in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation; range of motion was also recorded. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to identify differences between treatment groups and functional noninstrumented spine. Short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation did not achieve stability seen in an intact spine (P{\textless}.01), whereas LSPF constructs were significantly stiffer than SSPF constructs and demonstrated more stiffness than an intact spine (P{\textless}.01). Pedicle screws at the fracture level did not improve either SSPF or LSPF construct stability (P{\textgreater}.1). Long-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation constructs were not associated with increased adjacent segment motion. Al though the sample size of 6 specimens was small, this study may help guide clinical decisions regarding burst fracture stabilization. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(3):e514-e518.].},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty as a stand-alone treatment for stable vertebral burst fractures has been investigated in vitro and in clinical studies. These studies present inconsistent results on the mechanical response of vertebroplasty-treated burst fractures. In addition, observations of the loss of sagittal alignment after vertebroplasty raise questions on the applicability of vertebroplasty for burst fractures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical stability of burst fractures after stand-alone treatment by vertebroplasty. METHODS: Finite element simulations were performed with models generated from two laboratory-induced burst fractures in human thoracolumbar specimens. The burst fracture models were virtually injected with various cement volumes using a unipedicular or bipedicular approach. The models were subjected to four individual loads (compression, lateral bending, extension and torsion) and a multi-axial load case in the physiological range. FINDINGS: All treated burst fractures showed improvements in stiffness and a reduction in inter-fragmentary displacements, thus potentially providing a suitable mechanical environment for fracture healing. However, large volumes of the trabecular bone ({\textless}43{\%}), cement ({\textless}53{\%}) and bone-cement composite ({\textless}58{\%}) were predicted to experience strain levels exceeding the yield point. While damage was not specifically modeled, this implies a potential collapse of the treated vertebra due to local failure. INTERPRETATION: To improve the primary stability and to prevent the collapse of treated burst fractures, the use of posterior instrumentation is suggested as an adjunct to vertebroplasty.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) system was developed to streamline injury assessment and guide surgical decision making. To the best of the authors' knowledge, external validation in the pediatric age group has not been undertaken prior to this report. METHODS This study evaluated the use of the TLICS in a large retrospective series of children and adolescents treated at 4 pediatric medical centers (Texas Children's Hospital, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Riley Children's Hospital, and Doernbecher Children's Hospital). A total of 147 patients treated for traumatic thoracic or lumbar spine trauma between February 1, 2002, and September 1, 2015, were included in this study. Clinical and radiographic data were evaluated. Injuries were classified using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) status, Denis classification, and TLICS. RESULTS A total of 102 patients (69{\%}) were treated conservatively, and 45 patients (31{\%}) were treated surgically. All patients but one in the conservative group were classified as ASIA E. In this group, 86/102 patients (84{\%}) had Denis type compression injuries. The TLICS in the conservative group ranged from 1 to 10 (mean 1.6). Overall, 93{\%} of patients matched TLICS conservative treatment recommendations (score {\textless}/= 3). No patients crossed over to the surgical group in delayed fashion. In the surgical group, 26/45 (58{\%}) were ASIA E, whereas 19/45 (42{\%}) had neurological deficits (ASIA A, B, C, or D). One of 45 (2{\%}) patients was classified with Denis type compression injuries; 25/45 (56{\%}) were classified with Denis type burst injuries; 14/45 (31{\%}) were classified with Denis type seat belt injuries; and 5/45 (11{\%}) were classified with Denis type fracture-dislocation injuries. The TLICS ranged from 2 to 10 (mean 6.4). Eighty-two percent of patients matched TLICS surgical treatment recommendations (score {\textgreater}/= 5). No patients crossed over to the conservative management group. Eight patients (8/147, 5{\%}) had a calculated TLICS of 4, which meant they were candidates for surgery or conservative therapy by TLICS criteria. Excluding these patients, the degree of agreement between TLICS and surgeon decision was deemed to be very good (kappa = 0.878). CONCLUSIONS The TLICS results and recommendations matched treatment in 96{\%} of conservative group cases. In the surgical group, TLICS recommendations matched treatment in 93{\%} of cases. The TLICS recommendations and surgeon decision making displayed very good concordance. The TLICS appears to be effective in the classification of thoracic and lumbar spine injuries and in guiding treatment in the pediatric age group.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Aortic occlusion (AO) for resuscitation in traumatic shock remains  controversial. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) offers an emerging alternative. METHODS: The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery registry prospectively identified trauma patients requiring AO from eight ACS Level 1 centers. Presentation, intervention, and outcome variables were collected and analyzed to compare REBOA and open AO. RESULTS: From November 2013 to February 2015, 114 AO patients were captured (REBOA, 46; open AO, 68); 80.7{\%} were male, and 62.3{\%} were blunt injured. Aortic occlusion occurred in the emergency department (73.7{\%}) or the operating room (26.3{\%}). Hemodynamic improvement after AO was observed in 62.3{\%} [REBOA, 67.4{\%}; open OA, 61.8{\%}); 36.0{\%} achieving stability (systolic blood pressure consistently {\textgreater}90 mm Hg, {\textgreater}5 minutes); REBOA, 22 of 46 (47.8{\%}); open OA, 19 of 68 (27.9{\%}); p =0.014]. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) access was femoral cut-down (50{\%}); US guided (10.9{\%}) and percutaneous without imaging (28.3{\%}). Deployment was achieved in Zones I (78.6{\%}), II (2.4{\%}), and III (19.0{\%}). A second AO attempt was required in 9.6{\%} [REBOA, 2 of 46 (4.3{\%}); open OA, 9 of 68 (13.2{\%})]. Complications of REBOA were uncommon (pseudoaneurysm, 2.1{\%}; embolism, 4.3{\%}; limb ischemia, 0{\%}). There was no difference in time to successful AO between REBOA and open procedures (REBOA, 6.6 +/- 5.6 minutes; open OA, 7.2 +/- 15.1; p = 0.842). Overall survival was 21.1{\%} (24 of 114), with no significant difference between REBOA and open AO with regard to mortality [REBOA, 28.2{\%} (13 of 46); open OA, 16.1{\%} (11 of 68); p = 0.120]. CONCLUSION: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta has emerged as a viable alternative to open AO in centers that have developed this capability. Further maturation of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery database is required to better elucidate optimal indications and outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/care management study, level IV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fracture provides superior correction of kyphosis by an indirect reduction technique, but it has a high failure rate. We investigated the clinical and radiological results of temporary short-segment pedicle screw fixation without augmentation performed for thoracolumbar burst fractures with the goal of avoiding treatment failure by waiting to see if anterior reconstruction was necessary. METHODS: We studied 27 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who underwent short-segment posterior instrumentation using ligamentotaxis with Schanz screws and without augmentation. Implants were removed approximately 1 year after surgery. Neurological function, kyphotic deformity, canal compromise, fracture severity, and back pain were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: After surgery, all patients with neurological deficit had improvement equivalent to at least 1 grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale and had fracture union. Kyphotic deformity was reduced significantly, and maintenance of the reduced vertebra was successful even without vertebroplasty, regardless of load-sharing classification. Therefore, no patients required additional anterior reconstruction. Postoperative correction loss occurred because of disc degeneration, especially after implant removal. Ten patients had increasing back pain, and there are some correlations between the progression of kyphosis and back pain aggravation. CONCLUSION: Temporary short-segment fixation without augmentation yielded satisfactory results in reduction and maintenance of fractured vertebrae, and maintenance was independent of load-sharing classification. Kyphotic change was caused by loss of disc height mostly after implant removal. Such change might have been inevitable because adjacent endplates can be injured during the original spinal trauma. Kyphotic change after implant removal may thus be a limitation of this surgical procedure.},

A 42-year-old man was hospitalized for a thoracic vertebral fracture caused by being sandwiched against his back on broken concrete block. Computed tomography revealed a T12 dislocation fracture of AO type B2, multiple bilateral rib fractures, and a right hemopneumothorax. Four days after the injury, in order to promote early orthostasis and to improve respiratory status, we performed thoracolumbar posterior fusion surgery without decompression; the patient had back pain but no neurological deficits. Three hours after surgery, he complained of acute pain and severe weakness of his bilateral lower extremities; with allodynia below the level of his umbilicus, postoperative SEH was diagnosed. We performed immediate revision surgery. After removal of the hematoma, his symptoms improved gradually, and he was discharged ambulatory one month after revision surgery. Through experience of this case, we should strongly consider the possibility of preexisting SEH before surgery, even in patients with no neurological deficits. We should also consider perioperative coagulopathy in patients with multiple trauma, as in this case.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the technique of single-stage posterior subtotal corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures and to evaluate the radiographical and clinical outcomes of patients treated using this technique. METHODS: 16 consecutive patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with single-stage posterior subtotal corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction. The mean patient age was 54.8 years. The mean follower up period was 25 months. Five patients suffered from T12 fractures, 10 from L1, 1 from L2. The segmental kyphosis, neurologic status, visual analogue scale for back pain was evaluated before surgery and at follow up. RESULTS: The segmental kyphotic angle improved from 18.5 degrees before surgery to -9.2 degrees at the last follow up. The mean correction angle was 28.9 degrees. The mean surgical time was 255 minutes, and a mean intraoperative blood loss was 1073 mL. Intraoperative complications included two dural tears, and a superficial wound infection. There were no other severe complications. The mean visual analog scale of back pain decreased from a mean value of 6.6 to 2 at the last follow up. CONCLUSION: The single-stage posterior subtotal corpectomy and circumferential reconstruction achieved satisfactory kyphosis correction with direct visualization of the circumferentially decompressed spinal cord, as well as good fusion with less blood loss and complications. It is a safe and reliable surgical treatment option for unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PURPOSE: To develop a strategy to determine a sound method for decision-making based on postoperative clinical outcome satisfaction. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The ideal management of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures (TLBF) without neurological compromise remains controversial. METHODS: This was a prospective study. Patients with thoracolumbar injury severity and classification score (TLICS) {\textless}4 were treated nonoperatively, with bed rest and bracing until the pain decreased sufficiently to allow mobilization. Surgery was undertaken in patients with intractable pain despite an appropriate nonoperative treatment (surgery group). The Oswestry disability index (ODI) measure was observed at baseline and at the last follow-up. Clinically success was defined at least a 30{\%} improvement from the baseline ODI scores in both the conservative and surgery groups. All case records were assessed for gender, age, residual canal and angulations at the site of the fracture in order to determine which patients benefited from surgery or conservative treatment and which did not. RESULTS: In all 113 patients with T11-L5, TLBFs were treated. The patients' mean age was 49.2 years. Patients successfully completed either nonoperative (n=99) or surgical (n=14) treatment based on ODI. Clinical examinations revealed that all of the patients had intact neurology. The mean follow-up period was 29.5 months. There was a significant difference between the two groups based on age and residual canal. The mean ODI score significantly improved for both groups (p {\textless}0.01). According to the findings, a decision matrix was proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that TLICS {\textless}4, age, and residual canal can be used to guide the treatment of TLBF in conservative decision-making.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Calf spine model study. PURPOSE: To describe a technique of creating thoracolumbar burst fractures in calf spine model by low weight drop weight. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Burst fractures are one of the commonest types of thoracolumbar fractures and their treatment is controversial. Biomechanical studies aid in the decision of treatment of these fractures. A simple method of creation of burst fractures would help these biomechanical studies. METHODS: Ten specimens of thoracolumbar spines harvested from 6-8 week old calves were weakened at the target vertebra by standardized osteotomy cuts. Burst fractures were created by dropping a 5-kg of weight from a height of 1.2 m using an in-house device. An accelerometer attached to the weight measured the acceleration at the point of impact. RESULTS: Average weight and bone mineral density of the specimens was 390 g and 0.67 g/cm(2), respectively. Computed tomography scan analysis of the fractures revealed McCormack grade 2 and grade 3 fractures in 5 and 3 specimens, respectively, Dennis type 2B in 4, type 2A burst fractures in 5 specimens and fracture dislocation in 1 specimen, AO type A3.1.1 in 4 specimens, type A3.2.2 in 4 and type A3.3.3 in 2 specimens. Vertical laminar split fracture was seen in 6 specimens. Average acceleration and energy at impact was 9.04 m/sec and 54.24 Nm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a technique to create thoracolumbar burst fractures in calf spine by a drop weight method using a device that is simple to operate and easy to construct. The method is consistent and produces fractures similar to those occurring naturally, and can be considered as an alternative method for creating burst fractures in biomechanical studies.},

abstract = {Study Design Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies published  in English. Objective This study evaluated differences in outcome variables between percutaneous and open pedicle screws for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Methods A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed. The variables of interest included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, kyphosis angle, and vertebral body height, as well as intraoperative blood loss and operative time. The results were pooled by calculating the effect size based on the standardized difference in means. The studies were weighted by the inverse of the variance, which included both within- and between-study error. Confidence intervals were reported at 95{\%}. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I (2). Results After two-reviewer assessment, 38 studies were eliminated. Six studies were found to meet inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The combined effect size was found to be in favor of percutaneous fixation for blood loss and operative time (p {\textless} 0.05); however, there were no differences in vertebral body height (VBH), kyphosis angle, or VAS scores between open and percutaneous fixation. All of the studies demonstrated relative homogeneity, with I (2) {\textless} 25. Conclusions Patients with thoracolumbar fractures can be effectively managed with percutaneous or open pedicle screw placement. There are no differences in VBH, kyphosis angle, or VAS between the two groups. Blood loss and operative time were decreased in the percutaneous group, which may represent a potential benefit, particularly in the polytraumatized patient. All variables in this study demonstrated near-perfect homogeneity, and the effect is likely close to the true effect.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of pedicle screw-based posterior spinal instrumentation is recognized as one of the major surgical treatment methods for thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, the appropriate level in posterior segment instrumentation is still a point of debate. To assesses the long-term results of two-level and three-level posterior fixations of thoracolumbar burst fractures that have load-sharing scores of 7 and 8 points. METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2009, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and radiologic outcomes of 45 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures of 7 and 8 points in load-sharing classification who were operated on using two-level posterior fixation (one segment above and one segment below: 28 patients, group I) or three-level posterior fixation (two segments above and one segment below: 17 patients, group II). Clinical results included the grade of the fracture using the Frankel classification, and the visual analog score was used to evaluate pain before surgery, immediately after surgery, and during follow-up period. We also evaluated pain and work status at the final follow-up using the Denis pain scale. RESULTS: In all cases, non-union or loosening of implants was not observed. There were two screw breakages in two-level posterior fixation group, but bony union was obtained at the final follow-up. There were no significant differences in loss of anterior vertebral body height, correction loss, or change in adjacent discs. Also, in clinical evaluation, there was no significant difference in the neurological deficit of any patient during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, two-level posterior fixation could be used successfully in selected cases of thoracolumbar burst fractures of 7 and 8 points in the load-sharing classification.},

METHODS: From October 2010 to March 2013,23 patients with upper lumbar burst fractures (Denis B type) were treated by posterior short-segment fixation with undermining decompress by posterior ligament complex. There were 18 males and 5 females aged from 26 to 64 years old with an average of 45.7 years old. Twelve patients were caused by falling down, 5 cases were caused by traffic accident, 4 cases were the bruise injury caused by heavy object and 2 cases were caused by other injury. Fourteen patients were L1 fracture and 9 patients were L2 fracture. Thirteen patients were combined with nerve injuries (degree D according to ASIA classification). Internal fixation were removed from 12 to 20 months with an average of 14.3 months. JOA scores and imaging changes were recorded and compared at different time points. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 18 to 24 months with an average of 20.4 months. Thirteen patients with nerve injuries were completely recovered at 3 to 6 months after operation. JOA score at 1 year after operation was 20.63 +/- 0.92, and 20.38 +/- 1.06 at 3 months after removal of internal fixation,which were improved obviously than 9.90 +/- 2.73 at 3 months after operation. (P {\textgreater} 0.05) Anterior height of injured vertebrae, vertebral body angle and local Cobb angle was (95.0 +/- 0.53){\%}, (2.78 +/- 1.36) and (2.43 +/- 1.52) degrees respectively, and improved obviously than that of before operation (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no statistical significance in JOA scores at 3 months after removal of internal fixation and 1 year after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: posterior short-segment fixation with undermining decompress by posterior ligament complex for the treatment of upper lumbar burst fractures has advantages of minimally invasive, could effective recover vertebrae height, maintain stability of spine, decrease low back pain. It is a safe and effective operative method.},

abstract = {Kyphoplasty has been shown as a well-established technique for spinal injuries. This technique allows a vertebral bone augmentation with a reduction of morbidity and does not involve any adjacent segment immobilisation. There is a lack of biomechanical information resulting in major gaps of knowledge such as: the evaluation of the "quality" of stabilisation provided by kyphoplasty as a standalone procedure in case of unstable fracture. Our objective is to analyse biomechanical response of spine segments stabilised by Kyphoplasty and PMMA cement after experiencing burst fractures. Six fresh-frozen cadaveric spine specimens constituted by five vertebra (T11-L3) and four disks were tested. A specific loading setup has been developed to impose pure moments corresponding to loadings of flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. Tests were performed on each specimen in an intact state and post kyphoplasty following a burst fracture. Strain measurements and motion variations of spinal unit are measured by a 3D optical method. Strain measurements on vertebral bodies after kyphoplasty shows a great primary stabilisation. Comparisons of mobility and angles variations between the intact and post kyphoplasty states do not highlight significant difference. Percutaneous kyphoplasty offers a good primary stability in case of burst fracture. Kinematics analysis during physiological movements shows that this stabilisation solution preserve disk mobility in each adjacent spinal unit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pedicle screw fixation for treatment of thoracolumbar fracture via Wiltse paraspinal approach. METHODS: From June 2009 to June 2012, we enrolled into our study 53 cases of thoracolumbar fractures (single segment compressive or burst fractures) without neurologic injury, among whom 28 were treated by mini-open operation via Wiltse approach (group A) and 25 by conventional posterior open surgery (group B). We recorded and compared the intraoperative and postoperative performance between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no serious complications occurring during our study, such as infection, blood vessel injury, spinal cord or nerve root injury. We did not find any statistically difference between the two groups in corrected rate of Cobb's angle or vertebral body height (P{\textgreater}0.05). However, the mini-open method had apparent advantages over the conventional open method in operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and postoperative improvement on visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 3 days, 1 month, and 6 months after operation (P{\textless}0.05). After 9-24-month follow-up, the number of patients with low back pain in group A was less than that in group B. CONCLUSION: In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications, pedicle screw fixation via Wiltse paraspinal approach has the advantages of simple operation and less trauma in treatment of single-segment thoracolumbar fracture without neurologic injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between clinical factors and spontaneous  canal remodeling. METHODS: We evaluated computed tomography scans, before surgery, within a week after surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 12 months after surgery. Thirty-eight consecutive patients who underwent posterior fixation and fusion after thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in. Factors potentially affecting the postoperative degree of reduction and spontaneous spinal remodeling were defined as age, location, degree of change of anterior vertebral compression ratio, fracture type of the retropulse bone, presence of injury to the posterior longitudinal ligament, and posterolateral complex fracture. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on these factors to analyze the extent of their influence on the reduction and resorption rates. RESULTS: The recovery rate of the anterior compression (P = 0.003) was significantly related to the reduction rate after surgery; in addition, the recovery rate of the anterior compression (P = 0.022) and the comminuted type of fracture (P = 0.019) were significantly associated with the resorption rate after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: During posterior fixation, the degree of the reduction of the vertebral body by distraction can affect the degree of postoperative reduction and spontaneous bone remodeling. Therefore, close attention must be given to the indirect reduction technique through distraction during the operation. Because comminuted fracture fragments affect spontaneous canal remodeling, the degree of postoperative resorption can be estimated by preoperative computed tomography imaging.},

Objective The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score System (TLICS) is widely used to help guide the treatment of thoracolumbar spine trauma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the TLICS in clinical practice. Methods Using the Medline database without time restriction, we performed a systematic review using the keyword "Thoracolumbar Injury Classification," searching for articles utilizing the TLICS. We classified the results according to their level of evidence and main conclusions. Results Nine articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. One article evaluated the safety of the TLICS based on its clinical application (level II). The eight remaining articles were based on retrospective application of the score, comparing the proposed treatment suggested by the TLICS with the treatment patients actually received (level III). The TLICS was safe in surgical and nonsurgical treatment with regards to neurologic status. Some studies reported that the retrospective application of the TLICS had inconsistencies with the treatment of burst fractures without neurologic deficits. Conclusions This literature review suggested that the TLICS use was safe especially with regards to preservation or improvement of neurologic function.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The AOSpine thoracolumbar (TL) spine injury classification system is based mainly on computed tomography (CT). The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of CT scan in the diagnosis of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury in thoracolumbar spine trauma (TLST). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 43 patients with TLST. CT scans were evaluated independently by three spine surgeons on two separate occasions, 2 months apart. The reliability of PLC injury parameters was assessed by the Kappa coefficient (kappa) and the average percentage of these parameters was established. Injuries were classified according to the AOSpine classification as type A (compression), B (anterior and/or posterior tension band injuries) or C (dislocation) injury and the reliability of the classification was calculated. RESULTS: On average, PLC injury was identified in 91.4{\%} of type B or C injuries. Tension band injury and dislocation were found in 90.5{\%} of type B and 93.2{\%} of type C injuries. The intraobserver reliability for the PLC injury parameters ranged from 0.518 to 1.000, except for increased interspinous distance (IID). Interobserver reliability ranged from 0.303 to 0.688. When the patients were evaluated as a whole, dislocation showed the highest kappa (0.656 and 0.688). When type A or B injuries were assessed, the highest kappa were found for IID (0.533 and 0.511) and tension band injury (0.486 and 0.452). The kappa for AOSpine classification was 0.526 and 0.645 in both assessments. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of CT scan as the only diagnostic tool could identify PLC injury in most cases and demonstrated satisfactory reliability. Dislocation could satisfactorily diagnose type C injury, while IID was the best parameter to differentiate between type A and B injuries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of anterior single segment fixation on the  spinal biomechanical stabilization in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture of Denis type B with pedicle injury. METHODS: Six fresh human cadaveric spine specimens (T11-L3) were harvested as normal control (group A). Then the L1 Denis type B fracture model was created by the hemi-corpectomy method. Each specimen was tested in 3 different scenarios: anterior single segment (T12, L1) fixation with the integrity of the pedicle (group B), anterior single segment fixation with the resection of the unilateral pedicle (group C), and anterior single segment fixation with the resection of the bilateral pedicles (group D). Range of motion (ROM) in flexion/extension, bilateral bending, and bilateral axial rotation was measured by spinal three-dimensional measuring system under pure moments of 8.0 N x m. RESULTS: The ROM values of T12, L1 in flexion, extension, and right/left lateral bending of groups B, C, and D were significantly lower than those of group A (P {\textless} 0.05); group D was significantly higher than groups B and C (P {\textless} 0.05); but groups B and C showed no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The ROM values of T12, L1 in right/left axial rotation of groups B and C were significantly lower than those of groups A and D (P {\textless} 0.05), but there was no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between groups B and C and between groups A and D. The ROM values of L1,2 in flexion, extension, right/left lateral bending, and right/left axial rotation showed no significant difference between groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Resection of the unilateral pedicle has litter effects on the spine biomechanical stabilization of the anterior single segment fixation in the 6 degrees of freedom. However, the bilateral resection results show significant decrease in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation motion stability by the single segment fixation devices, especially in the axial rotation aspect.},

An apparatus was developed to maintain a porcine specimen in an upright position and apply a caudal impact simulating a fall. Five mature minipigs were impacted with varying impact magnitude. Computed tomography scans were used to assess the resulting fracture type, fracture level, spinal canal encroachment and fractures of adjacent bony structures. Lumbar fractures were produced on four specimens: three inferior endplate burst fractures (L2) and one superior endplate burst fracture (L5). One trial resulted in a hyperextension fracture between L2 and L3 vertebrae. Spinal canal encroachment was important for three specimens. No fracture was created on the pelvis or hind limbs. The proposed method developed and the resulting swine model of high energy vertebral fractures could be used to instigate novel biomechanical studies, to validate finite element models or to investigate surgical strategies.},

METHOD: All patients were treated by early mobilisation within the limits of pain, early bracing for patient confidence and all progress in mobilisation was recorded on video. Initial hospital stay was one week. Subsequent reviews were made on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: The mean duration from admission to final follow-up was three months, and longer follow-up was undertaken telephonically. The mean kyphosis deformity on arrival was 17.4 degrees (5 degrees to 29 degrees ); mean kyphosis at final discharge three months later was 19.5 degrees (1 degrees to 28 degrees ). Spinal canal encroachment had no influence on successful functional recovery. DISCUSSION: Pain has not been a significant problem for any patient, irrespective of the degree of kyphosis and no patient has a self-perception of clinical deformity. In all, 11 patients took occasional analgesia. All patients returned to their original work level or better. Two patients died 2.5 years after treatment, from unrelated causes. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The natural history of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurology would appear to be benign.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is generated through the hydrolysis of  phospha-tidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase A2 and is converted back to PC by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1). Elevated levels of (LPC) are known to play a pathogenic role in the inflammatory injury of asthma. However, the role of LPCAT1 in asthma has not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the exogenous expression of LPCAT1, delivered by using a recombinant lentiviral vector, could attenuate airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. METHODS: Recombinant lentivirus carrying cDNA encoding LPCAT1 (Lenti-LPCAT1), or EGFP (Lenti-EGFP) as a control, was constructed. BALB/c mice were sensitised with ovalbumin (OVA), and intratracheally pre-treated with an endobronchial administration of the recombinant lentivirus intratracheally 72 hours before the first challenge. After the last OVA challenges, the mice were assessed for airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness and lipid levels. RESULTS: Lenti-LPCAT1-infected HEK293T cells expressed exogenous recombinant LPCAT1 protein that showed high activity of the LPC acyltransferase. OVA sensitisation and challenge significantly increased the levels of saturated species LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) compared with wild-type mice respectively. The intratracheal Lenti-LPCAT1 instillation obviously down-regulated the OVA-induced release of LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0. Treatment with Lenti-LPCAT1 ameliorated OVA-induced airway hyper-responsiveness and reduced airway eosinophilia infiltration in lung tissue. Furthermore, the secretion of eotaxin and Th2-associated cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 were inhibited in BALF. The level of OVA-specific IgE in serum was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the exogenous expression of LPCAT1 may attenuate eosinophil inflammation in the airway by down-regulating the LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0 BALF levels in asthmatic mice.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The treatment of traumatic burst fractures unaccompanied by neurological  impairment remains controversial and ranges from conservative management to 360 degrees fusion. Because of the heterogeneity of fracture types, classification systems, and treatment options, comparative biomechanical studies might help to improve our knowledge. The aim of the current study was to create a standardized fracture model to investigate burst fractures in a multisegmental setting. METHODS: A total of 28 thoracolumbar fresh-frozen human cadaveric spines were used. The spines were dissected into segments (T11-L3). The T-11 and L-3 vertebral bodies were embedded in Technovit 3040 (cold-curing resin for surface testing and impressions). To simulate high energy, a metallic drop tower was designed. Stress risers were used to ensure comparable fractures. CT scans were acquired before and after fracture. All fractures were classified using the AO/OTA classification. RESULTS: The preparation and embedding of the spine segments worked well. No repositioning or second embedding of the specimen, even after fracture, was required. It was possible to create single burst fractures at the L-1 level in all 28 spine segments. Among the 28 fractures there were 16 incomplete burst fractures (Type A3.1), 8 burst-split fractures (Type A3.2), and 4 complete burst fractures (Type A3.3). The differences before and after fracture for stiffness and for anterior, posterior, and central heights were all significant (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The ability to create reproducible burst fractures of a single vertebral body in a thoracolumbar spine segment may serve as a basis for future biomechanical studies that will provide better understanding of mechanical properties or fixation techniques.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive inflammatory disease with limited therapeutic options. Inflammation plays an integral role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Unresolved inflammatory responses can lead to substantial tissue injury, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. The resolvins are a family of endogenous omega-3 fatty acid derived-lipid mediators of inflammation resolution. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) displays potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving activity, without causing immunosuppression. Its epimer, 17(R)-resolvin D1 (17(R)-RvD1), exhibits equivalent functionality to RvD1. In addition, 17(R)-RvD1 is resistant to rapid inactivation by eicosanoid oxidoreductases. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that 17(R)-RvD1 can provide a therapeutic benefit in IPF by reducing inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, while leaving the normal immune response intact. Mice were exposed to bleomycin (BLM) via micro-osmotic pump to induce pulmonary fibrosis, and were then treated with 17(R)-RvD1 or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection. Administration of 17(R)-RvD1 from the start of BLM treatment attenuated neutrophil alveolar infiltration, lung collagen content, and Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and type I collagen mRNA expression, along with subsequent reduction in histologically detectable fibrosis. The 17(R)-RvD1-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells was inhibited by an antagonist of lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2). The administration of 17(R)-RvD1 at the later fibrotic stage also improved the lung failure. These results suggest that 17(R)-RvD1 attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by promoting the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation and also provides pulmonary restoration. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of 17(R)-RvD1 in the management of this intractable disease.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It has been postulated that the complex patterns of spinal injuries have prevented adequate agreement using thoraco-lumbar spinal injuries (TLSI) classifications; however, limb fracture classifications have also shown variable agreements. This study compared agreement using two TLSI classifications with agreement using two classifications of fractures of the trochanteric area of the proximal femur (FTAPF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six evaluators classified the radiographs and computed tomography scans of 70 patients with acute TLSI using the Denis and the new AO Spine thoraco-lumbar injury classifications. Additionally, six evaluators classified the radiographs of 70 patients with FTAPF using the Tronzo and the AO schemes. Six weeks later, all cases were presented in a random sequence for repeat assessment. The Kappa coefficient (kappa) was used to determine agreement. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement: For TLSI, using the AOSpine classification, the mean kappa was 0.62 (0.57-0.66) considering fracture types, and 0.55 (0.52-0.57) considering sub-types; using the Denis classification, kappa was 0.62 (0.59-0.65). For FTAPF, with the AO scheme, the mean kappa was 0.58 (0.54-0.63) considering fracture types and 0.31 (0.28-0.33) considering sub-types; for the Tronzo classification, kappa was 0.54 (0.50-0.57). Intra-observer agreement: For TLSI, using the AOSpine scheme, the mean kappa was 0.77 (0.72-0.83) considering fracture types, and 0.71 (0.67-0.76) considering sub-types; for the Denis classification, kappa was 0.76 (0.71-0.81). For FTAPF, with the AO scheme, the mean kappa was 0.75 (0.69-0.81) considering fracture types and 0.45 (0.39-0.51) considering sub-types; for the Tronzo classification, kappa was 0.64 (0.58-0.70). CONCLUSION: Using the main types of AO classifications, inter- and intra-observer agreement of TLSI were comparable to agreement evaluating FTAPF; including sub-types, inter- and intra-observer agreement evaluating TLSI were significantly better than assessing FTAPF. Inter- and intra-observer agreements using the Denis classification were also significantly better than agreement using the Tronzo scheme.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: An agreement study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform an independent interobserver and intraobserver agreement assessment of the AOSpine subaxial cervical spine injury classification system. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The AOSpine subaxial cervical spine injury classification system was recently described. It showed substantial inter- and intraobserver agreement in the study describing it; however, an independent evaluation has not been performed. METHODS: Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging of 65 patients with acute traumatic subaxial cervical spine injuries were selected and classified using the morphologic grading of the subaxial cervical spine injury classification system by 6 evaluators (3 spine surgeons and 3 orthopedic surgery residents). After a 6-week interval, the 65 cases were presented to the same evaluators in a random sequence for repeat evaluation. The kappa coefficient (kappa) was used to determine the inter- and intraobserver agreement. RESULTS: The interobserver agreement was substantial when considering the fracture main types (A, B, C, or F), with kappa = 0.61 (0.57-0.64), but moderate when considering the subtypes: kappa = 0.57 (0.54-0.60). The intraobserver agreement was substantial considering the fracture types, with kappa = 0.68 (0.62-0.74) and considering subtypes, kappa = 0.62 (0.57-0.66). No significant differences were observed between spine surgeons and orthopedic residents in the overall inter- and intraobserver agreement, or in the inter- and intraobserver agreement of specific A, B, C, or F type of injuries. CONCLUSION: This classification allows adequate agreement among different observers and by the same observer on separate occasions. Future prospective studies should determine whether this classification allows surgeons to decide the best treatment for patients with subaxial cervical spine injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Historical, register-based cohort study following 85 patients in the course of a time frame extending from 2 years before to 2 years after trauma occurrence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of surgery versus conservative management for thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the prevalence of thoracolumbar burst fractures, consensus has still not been reached in terms of their clinical management and whereas from a health policy point of view, efficient use of resources is equally important, literature pertaining to this aspect is limited. METHODS: Consecutive patients who were admitted to a university clinic between 2004 and 2008 because of CT-verified AO type A3 fractures (T11-L2), age 18 to 65 years Patients with neurological compromise, osteoporosis, or malignancy were not included. The cost parameter defined primary and secondary health-care use (2010 {\&}OV0556;) and the effect parameter was based on three alternative measures of pain medication: morphine milligram and defined daily doses (DDD) of narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesics. For cost-effectiveness analysis, we employed a difference-in-difference approach, including control for treatment selection (age, sex, and fracture type). Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to estimate conventional 95{\%} confidence intervals of mean estimates. RESULTS: When taking into consideration all health-care consumption, surgical management was observed to cost an additional {\&}OV0556;10,734 (4215; 15,144) as compared with conservative management. The differences on morphine at 527(-3031; 6,016) milligram, narcotic analgesics at -8(-176; 127) DDD, and nonnarcotic analgesics at -3(-72; 58) DDD were all insignificant The probability for surgery being cost-effective did not exceed 50{\%} for any value of willingness to pay for effect. CONCLUSION: Surgical management does not seem to be a cost-effective strategy as compared with conservative management for traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficits. In addition, higher-volume studies examining the clinical effect of alternative management strategies would be valuable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the known demographic shift with expected doubled rate of vertebral body fractures by the year 2050, a standardized treatment concept for traumatic and osteoporotic incomplete burst fracture of the truncal spine does not exist. This study aims to determine whether minimally invasive fracture care for incomplete osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures using intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages is a suitable procedure and may provide improved safety in terms of cement-associated complications in comparison to kyphoplasty procedure. METHODS: In 2011/2012, 15 patients (10 women, 5 men; mean age 77) with 15 incomplete osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures (T10 to L4) were stabilized using intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages (OsseoFix(R)) as part of a prospective study. X-ray, MRI and bone density measurements (DXA) were performed preinterventionally. The clinical and radiological results were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively and after 12 months according to the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), X-ray (Beck Index, Cobb angle) and CT analyses. Wilcoxon rank sum test, sign test and Fischer's exact test were used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: A significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) from preoperative 8.0 to 1.6 after 12 months and significant improvement in activity level (ODI) from preoperative 79.0 to 30.5 {\%} after 12 months were revealed. Radiologically, the mean kyphotic angle according to Cobb showed significant improvements from preoperative 9.1 degrees to 8.0 degrees after 12 months. A vertebral body subsidence was revealed in only one case (6.7 {\%}). No changes in the position of the posterior wall were revealed. No cement leakage or perioperative complications were seen. CONCLUSION: As a safe and effective procedure, the use of intravertebral expandable titanium mesh cages presents a valuable alternative to usual intravertebral stabilization procedures for incomplete osteoporotic burst fractures and bears the potential to reduce cement-associated complications.

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Web-based multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess and compare the management strategy for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures between German and Dutch spine surgeons. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: To date, there is no evidence-based treatment algorithm for thoracolumbar spine fractures, thereby an international controversy concerning optimal treatment exists. METHODS: In this web-based multicenter study (www.spine.hostei.com), computed tomography scans of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures (T12-L2) were evaluated by German and Dutch spine surgeons. Supplementary case-specific information such as age, sex, height, weight, neurological status, and injury mechanism were provided.By using a questionnaire, fractures were classified according to the AO-Magerl Classification, followed by 6 questions concerning the treatment algorithm. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 21, 76, Chicago, IL). The interobserver agreement was determined by using Cohen kappa. Statistical significance was defined as P {\textless} 0.05. RESULTS: Twelve surgeons (6 per country) evaluated each 91 cases. The fractures were classified as AO Type A in 82{\%} (898 votes), Type B in 14{\%} (150 votes), and Type C in 4{\%} (44 votes). No significant difference concerning the AO Classification between German and Dutch spine surgeons was found. Overall German spine surgeons had a lower threshold concerning the indication for surgical treatment (Ger 87{\%} vs. NL 30{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). There was a consensus about operative stabilization of AO Type B and C injuries and injuries with neurologic deficit, whereas a discrepancy in the therapeutic algorithm for AO Type A fractures was observed. This difference was most pronounced regarding the indication for posterior (Ger 96.6{\%}; NL 41.2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05) and circumferential stabilization (Ger 53.4{\%}; NL 0{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05) for burst fractures. CONCLUSION: There is a consensus to stabilize AO Type B and C fractures, whereas country-specific differences in the treatment of Type A fractures, especially in case of burst fractures, occur. Prospective, controlled multicenter outcome studies may provide more evidence in optimal treatment for thoracolumbar fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the age- and gender-specific clinical characteristics of adult spine fractures in China. METHOD: A retrospective investigation was performed on consecutive patients with acute spinal fractures in 83 hospitals of 31 provinces in China between January 2010 and December 2011. All adult patients ({\textgreater}/=16 years) with spinal column fracture were included, while pathologic, old, and periprosthetic fractures were excluded. Each patient was analysed by reviewing the medical records and initial radiographs. RESULTS: There were 54,533 adult patients with spinal column fractures, accounting for 14.57 {\%} of overall fractures. The medium age was 57 years (range 16-100 years). There were 27,466 male patients with medium age of 49 years and 27,067 females with medium age of 63 years. The male to female ratio was 1.01:1 in study. It was 1.74:1 in patients less than 59 years, and 0.51:1 above 60 years. The most common injury site was L1, which accounted for 33.83 {\%} of cases. In the AO classification, the 53A and 52A groups comprised 85.53 {\%} of all fractures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the age- and gender-specific clinical characteristics of adults spine fractures and reveals a significant relationship among ages, sex, fracture localisation and complexity of spine fractures. Using the age of patients, the likelihood of sustaining adult spine fractures is predictable.},

This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Lipoxin A4 and its potential mechanism in a rabbit model with I/R spinal cord injury. Forty-five rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, I/R group and Lipoxin A4 group. Rabbits were subject to 30 min aortic occlusion to induce transient spinal cord ischemia. All animals were sacrificed after neurological evaluation with modified Tarlov criteria at the 48th hour after reperfusion, and the spinal cord segments (L4-6) were harvested for histopathological examination, as well as local malondialdehyde (MDA) and total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity analysis. All animals in the I/R group became paraplegic. While after 48-hour treatment, compared with I/R group, Lipoxin A4 significantly improved neurological function, reduced cell apoptosis and MDA levels as well as increased SOD activity (P {\textless} 0.05). These results suggest that Lipoxin A4 can ameliorate I/R induced spinal cord injury in Rabbit through its antiapoptosis and antioxidant activity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of thoracolumbar trauma involves correction of  posttraumatic deformity and placement of transpedicular instrumentation. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to generate first results reflecting the clinical and radiological outcome of patients treated with percutaneous dorsal instrumentation for fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine with the use of a transpedicular new Schanz Screw system (USS Fracture MIS, DePuy Synthes). METHODS: A total of 26 patients with fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine were operatively treated with bi-segmental dorsal instrumentation between January and December 2012. Radiological data acquisition was performed pre- and postoperatively, after six weeks, three, six, and twelve months. The radiological parameter of interest was the bi-segmental kyphotic end plate angle (Cobb angle). The Chronic Disability Index (CDI), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Spine Tango Core Outcome Measurement Index (COMI) were applied to investigate the clinical outcome. RESULTS: The clinical follow-up was completed by 22 patients (84.6{\%}), and the radiological follow-up by 21 (80.8{\%}) patients. Our patient population had a mean age of 47.4 +/- 4.1 years. Twelve patients received dorsal instrumentation, and 14 patients were treated with an additional ventral reconstruction. Intraoperative reduction was 11.5 +/- 1.5 degrees among all patients (p {\textless} 0.01). A considerable amount of the operative correction was lost after six weeks with a loss of reduction of 4.6 +/- 1.4 degrees (p {\textless} 0.01). At one year follow-up, the measured loss of reduction was significant in comparison to the postoperative state, 6.9 +/- 1.3 degrees among all patients, 8.7 +/- 2.1 degrees after dorsal and 4.9 +/- 1.1 degrees after dorsoventral stabilisation (all p {\textless} 0.01). Moreover, all patients had minimal to moderate disability with a CDI of 1.8 +/- 0.4 (0 - 7), and an ODI of 15.6 +/- 3.6 (0 - 60). CONCLUSION: The new transpedicular Schanz screw system can deliver a correction and stabilization of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. Patients report minimal to moderate disability as a result of their severe injury one year after trauma. We advocate the use of the transpedicular Schanz screw system to correct posttraumatic kyphotic deformity, with secondary anterior fusion in our treatment strategy of thoracolumbar incomplete burst fractures in patients without a neurologic deficit.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The identification of factors that lead to the failure of nonoperative management in neurologically intact thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF) can be controversial, particularly in the neurologically intact. Surgery for intact burst fractures has been advocated for early mobilization and a shorter hospital stay. These goals, however, have not always been achieved, rejuvenating an interest in nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Sixty-eight neurologically intact patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2), and a thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) of 2, were treated at our institution. Based on CT scans, patients were scored based on the load-sharing classification (LSC) scale. Initial treatment consisted of bracing in clamshell thoracolumbar orthosis and gradual mobilization. RESULTS: Owing to pain limiting mobilization, 18 patients failed nonoperative management and required instrumentation. Those who failed nonsurgical management were significantly more kyphotic (8 degrees +/- 10) and stenotic (52{\%} +/- 14{\%}) than those successfully treated nonoperatively (3 degrees +/- 7 and 63 +/- 12{\%}, respectively). The LSC score of those undergoing surgery (6.9 +/- 1.1) was also greater than those successfully treated nonoperatively (5.8 +/- 1.3, P = 0.006). Length of hospitalization was longer, and hospital charges higher in those requiring surgery compared to the nonoperative group. At follow-up there was no difference between groups in the visual analog score for pain (VAS) or the Oswestry disability index. CONCLUSION: Owing to pain limiting mobilization, a quarter of neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and a TLICS score of 2 failed nonsurgical management. The greater the kyphosis, stenosis, and fragmentation of the fracture, the more likely patients required surgery. In addition to the TLICS classification, other radiographic and clinical parameters should be included in selecting appropriate treatment strategy. The cost savings with nonoperative treatment of intact burst fractures, when appropriate, are significant.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A computed tomography study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to clarify the position of the aorta relative to the spine in patients with Lenke type 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several authors have examined the position of the aorta in patients with scoliosis; however, their analysis included several types of curve. There is a possibility that the position of the aorta differs according to the scoliosis curve type. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with Lenke type 1 were analyzed. The angle (left pedicle aorta [LtP-Ao] angle) and distance (LtP-Ao distance) from the insertion point of the left pedicle screw to the aorta were measured from T4 through L2. The measured data were evaluated from 4 levels above to 4 levels below the apical vertebra. The difference between lumbar modifiers A and C was examined. Dangerous pedicles, which were defined as those in which the aorta entered the expected area based on the screw direction error and length, were counted from T10 to L2. RESULTS: The aorta was located posterolaterally and adjacent to the vertebra at the middle thoracic level, and anteromedially and distant at the thoracolumbar level. LtP-Ao angle was largest at 1 level above the apical vertebra, and LtP-Ao distance was shortest at 2 levels above. LtP-Ao angle of Lenke 1A was significantly larger than 1C from T11 to L2, and LtP-Ao distance of 1A was significantly shorter than 1C from T11 to L1. When the screw length was 40 mm and the direction error was within 10 degrees , there were a large number of dangerous pedicles at T11, regardless of the lumbar modifier. CONCLUSION: The direction error has a potential risk of injuring the aorta around the apical vertebra. The selection of screws of the proper length is necessary to avoid a breach of the anterior vertebral wall at thoracolumbar level, especially at T11. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

A case review of the Electronic Medical Record at the index institution was performed to evaluate the timeline of events of the two patients who underwent fibular strut grafting for complex revisions of previous lumbar spine arthrodesis, including imaging studies, progress notes, and laboratory results. One patient had developed chronic L3 vertebral body osteomyelitis from a prior fibular allograft and instrumentation placed for a traumatic burst fracture. The second patient had a severe scoliosis recalcitrant to prior arthrodeses in the context of Marfan syndrome and a persistent L4-5 pseudarthrosis. Both patients underwent free vascularized fibular autograft revision arthrodeses. At most recent long-term follow-up, both patients had improved clinically and neither had required further revision. The use of free vascularized fibular grafting is an excellent option for a variety of spinal indications, and these two reports indicate that the technology may have an indication for use after multiple failed surgeries for osteomyelitis or correction of a multi-level large spinal deformity secondary to Marfan syndrome.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 17 patients with dura mater tear were retrospectively analyzed from March to September in 2003. There were 16 males and 1 female, aged from 16 to 67 years old with an average of (39.6 +/- 15.4) years. The injury site was at cervical vertebrae in 1 case, thoracic vertebrae in 9 cases, thoracolumbar junction in 4 cases, lumbar vertebrae in 3 cases. There were burst fracture in 4 cases and fracture-dislocation in 13 cases. According to ASIA grade, 12 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 2 cases were grade D, 1 case were grade E. Two cases caused by traffic accident, 10 by high falling, 4 by heavy parts crash, 1 by stairs fell during the earthquake. Absorbable hemostatic fluid gelatins were used to plug the dura mater tear,in order to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Postoperative drainage were recorded every day. RESULTS: Of 17 patients, 15 cases did not develop with cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Two cases develop with cerebrospinal fluid leakage after operation and their drainage were removed at 6 to 7 days after operation. In all cases, no complications related with cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred, such as headache, dizzy, fever,neck resistance, rash, incision disunion, incision infection, hematoma, neurologic symptoms aggravation. No abnormal phenomena was found on incision surrounding at follow-up of 9 months. CONCLUSION: Using absorbable hemostatic fluid gelatin to plug the dura mater tear during operation is an effective method in preventing postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation (SSPI) is used for unstable burst fractures to correct deformity and stabilize the spine for fusion. However, pedicle screw loosening, pullout, or breakage often occurs due to the large moment applied during spine motion, leading to poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of a newly designed device, the Trans-Endplate Pedicle Pillar System (TEPPS), to enhance SSPI rigidity and decrease the screw bending moment with a simple posterior approach. METHODS: Six human cadaveric spines (T11-L3) were harvested. A burst fracture was created at L1, and the SSPI (Moss Miami System) was used for SSPI fixation. Strain gauge sensors were mounted on upper pedicle screws to measure screw load bearing. Segmental motion (T12-L2) was measured under pure moment of 7.5 Nm. The spine was tested sequentially under 4 conditions: intact; first SSPI alone (SSPI-1); SSPI+TEPPS; and second SSPI alone (SSPI-2). RESULTS: SSPI+TEPPS increased fixation rigidity by 41{\%} in flexion/extension, 28{\%} in lateral bending, and 37{\%} in axial rotation compared with SSPI-1 (P{\textless}0.001), and it performed even better compared to SSPI-2 (P{\textless}0.001 for all). Importantly, the bending moment on the pedicle screws for SSPI+TEPPS was significantly decreased 63{\%} during spine flexion and 47{\%} in lateral bending (p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSION: TEPPS provided strong anterior support, enhanced SSPI fixation rigidity, and dramatically decreased the load on the pedicle screws. Its biomechanical benefits could potentially improve fusion rates and decrease SSPI instrumentation failure.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite a sizable amount of literature, the optimal management of thoracolumbar fractures remains controversial and many authors assume the existence of disc lesions in Magerl type A fractures. The purpose of the study was to assess the intervertebral discs in these fractures at the time of trauma. The hypothesis was that there was no change in shape and signal intensity of the discs initially. METHODS: Fifty-one patients diagnosed with 87 types A1 and A3 thoracolumbar fractures were enrolled in a prospective study. MRI analysis involved evaluation of disc signal, height and morphological modifications according to Oner's classification. RESULTS: No signal intensity modification was identified on MRI. Disc morphology was either normal or altered with creeping of discal tissue in the vertebral endplate depression. Overall, 98{\%} of the discs were either type 1 or type 3. Mean disc height on MRI was 1.03 +/- 0.36 initially. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, MRI showed that no loss of height occurred in discs adjacent to fractured vertebra and that there was no major alteration of the disc in terms of signal intensity and morphology. Therefore, the intervertebral disc should not be removed in Magerl type A fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effectiveness of balloon vertebroplasty  combined with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Between June 2011 and December 2013, 22 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included. There were 14 males and 8 females, aged 20-60 years (mean, 42.5 years). The fracture segments included T11 in 1 case, T12 in 4 cases, L1 in 10 cases, L2 in 6 cases, and L3 in 1 case. According to AO classification system, there were 13 cases of type A and 9 cases of type B. Spinal cord injury was classified as grade C in 2 cases, grade D in 3 cases, and grade E in 17 cases according to Frankel scale. The time from injury to operation was 3-10 days (mean, 5.5 days). All patients underwent posterior reduction and fixation via the injured vertebra, transpedicular balloon reduction of the endplate and calcium sulfate cement (CSC) injection. The ratio of anterior vertebral height, the ratio of central vertebral height, the sagittal Cobb angle, the restoration of nervous function, and internal fixation failure were analyzed. RESULTS: Primary healing of incision was obtained in the others except 2 cases of poor healing, which was cured after dressing change or debridement. All the patients were followed up 9-40 months (mean, 15 months). CSC leakage occurred in 2 cases. Absorption of CSC was observed at 8 weeks after operation with complete absorption time of 12-16 weeks (mean, 13.2 weeks). The mean fracture healing time was 18.5 weeks (range, 16-20 weeks). The ratio of anterior vertebral height, ratio of central vertebral height, and sagittal Cobb angle were significantly improved at 1 week and 3 months after operation and last follow-up when compared with preoperative values (P {\textless} 0.01), but no significant difference was found among 3 time points after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.01). There was no internal fixation failure or Cobb angle loss more than 10 degrees . Frankel scale was improved with no deterioration of neurologic function injury. CONCLUSION: Balloon vertebroplasty combined with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is simple and safe for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, and it can improve the quality of reduction, restore vertebral mechanical performance effectively, and prevent the loss of correction and internal fixation failure.},

abstract = {OBJECT The aim of this study was to determine if the ability of a surgeon to correctly classify A3 (burst fractures with a single endplate involved) and A4 (burst fractures with both endplates involved) fractures is affected by either the region or the experience of the surgeon. METHODS A survey was sent to 100 AOSpine members from all 6 AO regions of the world (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) who had no prior knowledge of the new AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. Respondents were asked to classify 25 cases, including 6 thoracolumbar burst fractures (A3 or A4). This study focuses on the effect of region and experience on surgeons' ability to properly classify these 2 controversial fracture variants. RESULTS All 100 surveyed surgeons completed the survey, and no significant regional (p {\textgreater} 0.50) or experiential (p {\textgreater} 0.21) variability in the ability to correctly classify burst fractures was identified; however, surgeons from all regions and with all levels of experience were more likely to correctly classify A3 fractures than A4 fractures (p {\textless} 0.01). Further analysis demonstrated that no region predisposed surgeons to increasing their assessment of severity of burst fractures. CONCLUSIONS A3 and A4 fractures are the most difficult 2 fractures to correctly classify, but this is not affected by the region or experience of the surgeon; therefore, regional variations in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures (A3 and A4) is not due to differing radiographic interpretation of the fractures.},

abstract = {Spine fractures account for a large portion of musculoskeletal injuries worldwide. A classi fi cation of spine fractures is necessary in order to develop a common language for treatment indications and outcomes. Several classification systems have been developed based on injury anatomy or mechanisms of action, but they have demonstrated poor reliability, have yielded little prognostic information, and have not been widely used. For this reason, the Arbeitsgemeinschaftfur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) committee has classified thorocolumbar spine injuries based on the pathomorphological criteria into3 types (A: Compression; B: Distraction; C: Axial torque and rotational deformity). Each of these types is further divided into 3 groups and 3 subgroups re fl ecting progressive scale of morphological damage and the degree of instability. Because of its highly detailed sub classifications, the AO system has shown limited interobserver variability. It is similar to its predecessors in that it does not incorporate the patient's neurologic status.The need for a reliable, reproducible, clinically relevant, prognostic classification system with an optimal balance of ease of use and detail of injury description contributed to the development of a new classification system, the thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS). The TLICS de fi nes injury based on three clinical characteristics: injury morphology, integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex, and neurologic status of the patient. The severity score offers prognostic information and is helpful in decision making about surgical vs nonsurgical management.},

abstract = {Study Design Survey of spine surgeons. Objective To determine the reliability with which international spine surgeons identify a posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury in a patient with a compression-type vertebral body fracture (type A). Methods A survey was sent to all AOSpine members from the six AO regions of the world. The survey consisted of 10 cases of type A fractures (2 subtype A1, 2 subtype A2, 3 subtype A3, and 3 subtype A4 fractures) with appropriate imaging (plain radiographs, computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging), and the respondent was asked to identify fractures with a PLC disruption, as well as to indicate if the integrity of the PLC would affect their treatment recommendation. Results Five hundred twenty-nine spine surgeons from all six AO regions of the world completed the survey. The overall interobserver reliability in determining the integrity of the PLC was slight (kappa = 0.11). No substantial regional or experiential difference was identified in determining PLC integrity or its absence; however, a regional difference was identified (p {\textless} 0.001) in how PLC integrity influenced the treatment of type A fractures. Conclusion The results of this survey indicate that there is only slight international reliability in determining the integrity of the PLC in type A fractures. Although the biomechanical importance of the PLC is not in doubt, the inability to reliably determine the integrity of the PLC may limit the utility of the M1 modifier in the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System.},

The aim of this study is assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) regarding short form-36 (SF-36) and its correlation with kyphosis in patients affected by thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit undergoing posterior short segment pedicular screw fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficits, meeting our criteria were enrolled in this study. The patients underwent short segment pedicular screw fixation. After 2 years of follow-up, the outcome assessment was performed with evaluating HRQOL; SF-36. The mean +/- standard deviation was measured at each eight category of SF-36 and compared with normative values of Iran. The correlation of Cobb angle and body pain was analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: The study detected reduced quality of life (QOL), with total mean of 49.7 +/- 14 and physical function grade of 61.2 +/- 22 which was significantly lower than Iran normative reported as 85.9 +/- 19. Fifty percent still suffered from moderate to severe pain and Cobb angle had no statistically significant correlation with body pain.

However, reliability data from additional institutions for the AOSTLIC system are not available. This study was to examine the reliability of the AOSTLIC system in patients with thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between August 2009 and June 2012, 56 patients with 74 levels traumatic TL spinal injuries were recruited. Two classifiers, consisting of two spine surgeons, assessed clinical and imaging data. Initially, one surgeon reviewed the data in order to classify and calculate injury severity score according to the AOSTSIC system. This process was repeated on a 5-week interval by another surgeon. Then we analyzed data for intra-observer and inter-observer reliability using the kappa statistic (k). Finally, validity was assessed using the known-groups comparison. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 59.5 +/- 11.5 years. The kappa values for the AOSTSIC system for intra-observer and inter-observer reliability ranged from 0.83 to 0.89, indicating nearly perfect agreement agreements. Known-groups analysis showed satisfactory results. The AOSTSIC system discriminated well between sub-groups of patients who differed in Oswestry disability index. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the morphologic classification in AOSTSIC system appears to be reliable and reproducible classification.},

abstract = {We aimed in this study to investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), given as theta burst stimulation (TBS), can interfere with non-painful phantom sensations in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). In double-blind, sham-controlled experiments in five subjects with cervical or thoracic traumatic SCI, we evaluated the effects of a single session of inhibitory (continuous) TBS, excitatory (intermittent) TBS, or placebo TBS, on simplex and complex non-painful phantom sensations. The interventions targeted the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), the primary sensory cortex (S1) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Measurements were carried out at baseline (T0), 5 min (T1) and 30 min later (T2) after the intervention. Descriptive evaluation of results shows that non-painful phantom sensations were not affected by rTMS applied over M1. Continuous (inhibitory) TBS over S1 induced a short-lasting decrease of simple non-painful phantom sensations, while continuous TBS over PPC induced a short-lasting decrease of both simple and complex phantom sensations. Intermittent (excitatory) TBS over PPC induced a slight increase of non-painful phantom sensations. Tests for significance confirm these observations, but must be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size. In conclusion, non-painful phantom sensations may be associated to a hyperexcitability of PPC and to a lesser extent of S1, which can be normalized by inhibitory rTMS. Our preliminary findings provide further evidence that neuromodulatory techniques are able to reverse phantom sensations not only after limb amputation but also in other conditions characterized by deafferentation such as SCI.},

We retrospective review medical charts of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures from July 2010 to September 2013. The fractures were classified according to the Arbeit Fuer Osteoosynthese (AO) classification system. Neurological status was classified according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). Patients were divided into two groups (reposition group and non-reposition group) according to whether the bone fragments were reposition or non-reposition after surgery. Mimics measured mid-sagittal canal diameter (MSD), transverse canal diameter (TCD), local kyphosis (LK) and calculated anterior vertebral body compression ratio (AVBCR), middle vertebral body compression ratio (MVBCR), posterior vertebral body compression ratio (PVBCR), and mid-sagittal canal diameter compression ratio (MSDCR) on the preoperative CT image. The results indicated that 55 patients were included in the study. There are 35 patients with reposition of bone fragment and 20 patients with non-reposition of bone fragment after surgery. There were significant difference on MSD (t = 3.258, P = 0.002), TCD (t = 2.197, P = 0.032), AVBCR (t = -2.063, P = 0.044), MVBCR (t = -2.526, P = 0.015), PVBCR (t = -2.211, P = 0.031), MSDCR (t = -4.975, P = 0.000) between two groups before surgery. There was a significant correlation between reposition of bone fragment and AO classification (OR = 5.251, P = 0.022), and MSDCR (OR = 7.366, P = 0.007). There was no significant correlation between reposition and AVBCR, MVBCR, PVBCR, LK, MSD and TCD.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical, EEG, and brain imaging findings in an adult case series of patients with de novo refractory status epilepticus (SE) occurring after a febrile illness. METHODS: A retrospective study (2010-2013) was undertaken with the following inclusion criteria: (1) previously healthy adults with refractory SE; (2) seizure onset 0-21 days after a febrile illness; (3) lacking evidence of infectious agents in CSF; (4) no history of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or previous or concomitant neurologic disorder. RESULTS: Among 155 refractory SE cases observed in the study period, 6 patients (17-35 years old) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Confusion and stupor were the most common symptoms at disease onset, followed after a few days by acute repeated seizures that were uncountable in all but one. Seizures consisted of focal motor/myoclonic phenomena with subsequent generalization. Antiepileptic drugs failed in every patient to control seizures, with all participants requiring intensive care unit admission. Barbiturate coma with burst-suppression pattern was applied in 4 out of 6 patients for 5-14 days. One participant died in the acute phase. In each patient, we observed a reversible bilateral claustrum MRI hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences, without restricted diffusion, time-related with SE. All patients had negative multiple neural antibodies testing. Four out of 5 surviving patients developed chronic epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: This is a hypothesis-generating study of a preliminary nature supporting the role of the claustrum in postfebrile de novo SE; future prospective studies are needed to delineate the specificity of this condition, its pathogenesis, and the etiology.},

The intimate information of patients including age, gender, cause of injury, site of the sternal fracture, level and type of thoracic vertebral fracture, spinal cord injury and associated injuries were included in the analysis. There were 12 compressed fractures, 11 fracture-dislocations, two burst fracture and one burst-dislocation in this study. Six patients had a complete lesion of the spinal cord, nine sustained a neurologically incomplete injury and 11 were neurologically intact. Nine patients were treated non-operatively and 17 were underwent surgery. All patients were followed up for 8{\~{}}99 months. Our results showed that road traffic accidents (RTA) and fall were the dominated in the causes. All six patients with a complete paralytic lesion were not recovered with any significant function. Four out of eleven neurologically intact patients had local pain although ten of them remained normal function and one patient turn up tardive paralysis. One of nine patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal and four recovered with some function. These study suggested that the sternum is one of the important parts in constructing thoracic cage and plays an important role in maintain the stabilization of the thoracic vertebra. Because of the unique anatomy and biomechanics of the thoracic cage, the classification commonly applied to thoracic vertebra fractures is not suitable for middle-super thoracic fractures associated with the sternum fracture. Middle-super thoracic fractures associated with the sternum fracture was marked by violent force, severe fractures of spine, severe injuries of spinal cord and high incidence of associated injuries. These cases confirm the existence and clinical relevance of the fourth column of the thoracic spine and its role for spinal stability in the patient with middle-super thoracic fracture.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Posterior longitudinal ligament reduction (PLLR) has been widely used  for treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, there are no systemic studies assessing the influence of position parameters of intra-canal fracture fragment (IFF) itself on outcome of reduction. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between position parameters of IFF and the reduction efficacy of PLLR. METHODS: Sixty-two patients (average age, 36.9 years) with single thoracolumbar burst fractures and intact posterior longitudinal ligaments were recruited. Patients were divided into reduced and unreduced groups based on IFF reduction situations by PLLR. Preoperative and intraoperative computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate reduction and location parameters of IFF, such as position, width, height, inversion, and horizontal angle, ratio of width of IFF to the transverse diameter of vertebral canal (R 1), and ratio of height of IFF to height of injured vertebrae (R 2) before and after PLLR. RESULTS: There were significant differences in width (P {\textless} 0.001), height (P = 0.0141; R 1, P {\textless} 0.001), and R 2 (P = 0.0045) between the two groups. When width of IFF was more than 75 {\%} of transverse diameter of vertebral canal and height of IFF was more than 47 {\%} of height of injured vertebrae, the IFF could not be reduced by PLLR. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, IFF in apterium of the posterior longitudinal ligament cannot be reduced by PLLR. For thoracolumbar burst fractures that cover the posterior longitudinal ligament, the width and height of IFF are important parameters that influence reduction quality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures is still controversial. The thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) algorithm is now widely used to guide clinical decision making, however, in clinical practice, we come to realize that TLICS also has its limitations for treating patients with total scores less than 4, for which conservative treatment may not be optimal in all cases. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to identify several risk factors for the failure of conservative treatment of TL burst fractures according to TLICS algorithm. METHODS: From June 2008 to December 2013, a cohort of 129 patients with T10-l2 TL burst fractures with a TLISC score {\textless}/=3 treated non-operatively were identified and included into this retrospective study. Age, sex, pain intensity, interpedicular distance (IPD), canal compromise, loss of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle (KA) were selected as potential risk factors and compared between the non-operative success group and the non-operative failure group. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients successfully completed non-operative treatment, the other 25 patients were converted to surgical treatment because of persistent local back pain or progressive neurological deficits during follow-up. Our results showed that age, visual analogue scale (VAS) score and IPD, KA were significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, regression analysis indicated that VAS score and IPD could be considered as significant predictors for the failure of conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: The recommendation of non-operative treatment for TLICS score {\textless}/=3 has limitations in some patients, and VAS score and IPD could be considered as risk factors for the failure of conservative treatment. Thus, conservative treatment should be decided with caution in patients with greater VAS scores or IPD. If non-operative management is decided, a close follow-up is necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical and radiological results of short pedicle screw fixation and vertebroplasty in osteoporotic thoracolumbar severe burst fractures. METHODS: From September 2006 to August 2010, 19 consecutive patients sustained osteoporotic thoracolumbar severe burst fractures with or without neurologic deficit and were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent short pedicle screw fixation and vertebroplasty. Segmental kyphosis, AVBHr and PVBHr, and Canal compromise were calculated on radiographs pre-operatively, post-operative and at final follow up. VAS, ODI and SF-36 were calculated pre-operatively and at final follow up. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 70.8 min (range 60{\~{}}100 min) and mean blood loss was 92 ml (range 60{\~{}}160 ml). The mean duration of their hospital stay was 4.5 days (range 3-7 days). The operative incisions were healing well. Average follow up time was 40.1 months (range 24{\~{}}72 months). The AVBHr was corrected from preoperative (48.1 +/- 6.8) {\%} to postoperative (94.1 +/- 1.7) {\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). The PVBHr was corrected from preoperative (62.7 +/- 4.8) {\%} to postoperative (92.8 +/- 1.8) {\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). Canal compromise was corrected from preoperative (37.3 +/- 5.8) {\%} to postoperative (5.9 +/- 2.3) {\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). The segmental kyphosis was corrected from preoperative (20.6 +/- 5.3) degree to postoperative (2.0 +/- 3.2) degree (P {\textless} 0.001). VAS scores were reduced from preoperative 7.21 +/- 0.86 to 2.21 +/- 0.98 at final follow up (P {\textless} 0.001). SF-36 Bodily pain was reduced from preoperative 75.31 +/- 13.85 to 13.74 +/- 13.24 at final follow up (P {\textless} 0.001), and SF-36 Role Physical was reduced from preoperative 59.21 +/- 26.63 to 19.74 +/- 22.94 at final follow up (P {\textless} 0.001). The ODI scores were reduced from preoperative 81.68 +/- 4.44 to 15.37 +/- 5.54 at final follow up (P {\textless} 0.001). All 4 patients with partial neurological deficit initially had improvement. Cement leakage was observed in 3 cases (two anterior to vertebral body and one into the disc without sequela). There were no instances of instrumentation failure and no patient had persistent postoperative back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty and short pedicle screw fixation has the advantages of both radiographic and functional results for treating osteoporotic thoracolumbar severe burst fractures using a purely posterior approach.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of a prospectively gathered database. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and pattern of thoracic and lumbar (T and L) spine injuries among elderly subjects involved in motor vehicle collision (MVC). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adults age 65 and older currently constitute more than 16{\%} of all licensed drivers. Despite driving less than the young, older drivers are involved in a higher proportion of crashes. Notwithstanding the safety features in modern vehicles, 15.8{\%} to 51{\%} of all T and L spine injuries result from MVCs. METHODS: Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network database is a prospectively maintained, multicentered database that enrolls MVC occupants with moderate-to-severe injuries. It was queried for T and L spine injuries in subjects 65 and older. 142 Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network files for all elderly individuals were reviewed for demographic, injury, and crash data. Each occupant's T and L injury was categorized using a modified Denis classification. RESULTS: Of 661 elderly subjects, 142 (21.48{\%}) sustained T and L spine injuries. Of the 102 major injuries, there were 63 compression, 20 burst and 12 extension fractures. Seatbelt use predisposed elderly subjects to compression and burst fractures, whereas seatbelt and airbag use predisposed to burst fractures. Deployment of airbags without seatbelt use appeared to predispose elderly subjects to neurological injury, higher Injury Severity Score, and higher mortality. Occupants using 3-point belts who had airbags deployed during the collision had the lowest rates of fatality and neurological injury. CONCLUSION: T and L spine injuries in the elderly are not uncommon despite restraint use. Whereas seatbelts used alone and in conjunction with airbag deployment reduced fatalities and neurological injuries in the elderly, deployment of airbags in occupants without seatbelts predisposed to more severe injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anterior decompression and reconstruction have gained wide acceptance as viable alternatives for unstable mid-lumbar burst fracture, but there are no mid and long term prospective studies regarding clinical and radiologic results of mid-lumbar burst fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study of 56 consecutive patients of mid-lumbar burst fractures with a load-sharing score of 7 or more treated with anterior plating was carried out. All patients were evaluated for radiologic and clinical outcomes. The fusion status, spinal canal compromise, segmental kyphotic angle (SKA), vertebral body height loss (VBHL), and adjacent segment degeneration was examined for radiologic outcome, whereas the American Spinal Injury Association scale, the visual analog scale (VAS), and the employment status were used for clinical evaluation. RESULTS: The patients underwent clinical and radiologic followup for at least 5 years after the surgery. At the last followup, there was no case of internal fixation failure, adjacent segment degeneration, and other complications. Interbody fusion was achieved in all cases. The average fusion time was 4.5 months. No patient suffered neurological deterioration and the average neurologic recovery was 1.3 grades on final observation. Based on VAS pain scores, canal compromise, percentage of VBHL and SKA, the difference was statistically significant between the preoperative period and postoperative or final followup (P {\textless} 0.05). Results at postoperative and final followup were better than the preoperative period. However, the difference was not significant between postoperative and final followup (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Thirty-four patients who were employed before the injury returned to work after the operation, 15 had changed to less strenuous work. CONCLUSION: Good mid term clinicoradiological results of anterior decompression with D-rod and titanium mesh fixation for suitable patients with mid-lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurologic deficits can be achieved. The incident rate of complications was low. D-rod is a reliable implant and has some potential advantages in L4 vertebral fractures.},

abstract = {Study Design Literature review. Objective The aim of this review is to highlight  challenges in the development of a comprehensive surgical algorithm to accompany the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. Methods A narrative review of the relevant spine trauma literature was undertaken with input from the multidisciplinary AOSpine International Trauma Knowledge Forum. Results The transitional areas of the spine, in particular the cervicothoracic junction, pose unique challenges. The upper thoracic vertebrae have a transitional anatomy with elements similar to the subaxial cervical spine. When treating these fractures, the surgeon must be aware of the instability due to the junctional location of these fractures. Additionally, although the narrow spinal canal makes neurologic injuries common, the small pedicles and the inability to perform an anterior exposure make decompression surgery challenging. Similarly, low lumbar fractures and fractures at the lumbosacral junction cannot always be treated in the same manner as fractures in the more cephalad thoracolumbar spine. Although the unique biomechanical environment of the low lumbar spine makes a progressive kyphotic deformity less likely because of the substantial lordosis normally present in the low lumbar spine, even a fracture leading to a neutral alignment may dramatically alter the patient's sagittal balance. Conclusion Although the new AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System was designed to be a comprehensive thoracolumbar classification, fractures at the cervicothoracic junction and the lumbosacral junction have properties unique to these junctional locations. The specific characteristics of injuries in these regions may alter the most appropriate treatment, and so surgeons must use clinical judgment to determine the optimal treatment of these complex fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and reliability of the new AO Classification, a recent classification system for Thoraco-Lumbar Spine Trauma (TLST). DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: We applied the new AO system in patients with TLST treated according to the TLICS. Two researchers classified injuries independently. Eight weeks later, the classification was repeated for intra and inter-observer agreement evaluation. To evaluate safety, we correlated the treatment performed based on the TLICS with the newer AO classification obtained. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included in this study, with a mean follow-up of 363.8 days. Twenty-three neurologically intact patients were initially treated conservatively. Their mean TLICS was 1.78 (1-4 points). Four patients underwent late surgery. Thirty-one patients were treated surgically. Their average TLICS was 7.22 points (4-10 points). Agreements in the four independent evaluations according to AO groups and subgroups were of 64.8{\%} (35/54) and 55.5{\%} (30/54) respectively. Kappa index for groups A, B and C was 0.75, 0.7 and 0.85 respectively. Kappa index for subgroups ranged from 0.16 to 0.85. Regarding safety, thirty (57.6{\%}) patients with total subgroups agreement were analyzed. All patients with fracture in groups B and C underwent surgical treatment and patients in group A received surgery according to neurological status or failure of conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: The newer AO spine classification demonstrated good reliability at the level of groups. Subgroups demonstrated worse and varying reliability. Although the safety analysis was limited due to the low level of total concordance among all evaluations, patients from group A can be treated conservatively or surgically, whereas those from groups B and C are treated surgically.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: International validation study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of the spine surgeons' level of experience on the intraobserver reliability of the novel AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification system, and the appropriate classification according to this system. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Wide variability has been demonstrated for intraobserver reliability of the AOSpine classification system. The spine surgeons' level of experience may play a crucial role in the appropriate classification of thoracolumbar fractures, and the degree of reproducibility of the same observer on separate occasions. However, this has not been previously investigated. METHODS: After a training on the classification system, high quality CT images together with clinical data from 25 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were independently assessed by 100 spine surgeons from across the world on 2 different occasions, 1 month apart from each other. The spine surgeons were allocated to a subgroup, according to their years of experience. Intraobserver reliability was calculated for each individual surgeon and for each subgroup, using the Kappa statistics (kappa). Descriptive statistics was used to describe any differences between the subgroups. Analysis of any misclassifications was performed by calculating sensitivity and specificity estimates. RESULTS: Almost all surgeons demonstrated at least moderate intraobserver reliability. All surgeon subgroups demonstrated substantial reliability (kappa = 0.67-0.69) for fracture subtype grading, and almost all subgroups demonstrated excellent reliability (kappa = 0.79-0.83) for fracture morphology type regardless of subtype identified. In general, the fractures were most frequently misclassified by the most experienced surgeons. No major differences were observed among the subgroups when comparing the sensitivity and specificity rates. CONCLUSION: This international study demonstrated that the spine surgeons' level of experience does not substantially influence the classification and intraobserver reliability of the recently described AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The treatment of vertebral burst fractures is still controversial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the purpose of additional percutaneous intravertebral reduction when combined with dorsal instrumentation. METHODS: In this biomechanical cadaver study twenty-eight spine segments (T11-L3) were used (male donors, mean age 64.9 +/- 6.5 years). Burst fractures of L1 were generated using a standardised protocol. After fracture all spines were allocated to four similar groups and randomised according to surgical techniques (posterior instrumentation; posterior instrumentation + intravertebral reduction device + cement augmentation; posterior instrumentation + intravertebral reduction device without cement; and intravertebral reduction device + cement augmentation). After treatment, 100000 cycles (100-600 N, 3 Hz) were applied using a servohydraulic loading frame. RESULTS: Overall anatomical restoration was better in all groups where the intravertebral reduction device was used (p {\textless} 0.05). In particular, it was possible to restore central endplates (p {\textgreater} 0.05). All techniques decreased narrowing of the spinal canal. After loading, clearance could be maintained in all groups fitted with the intravertebral reduction device. Narrowing increased in the group treated with dorsal instrumentation. CONCLUSIONS: For height and anatomical restoration, the combination of an intravertebral reduction device with dorsal instrumentation showed significantly better results than sole dorsal instrumentation.},

METHOD: 63 patients with thoracolumbar incomplete burst fracture were managed with iMSPI or SSPI. 30 patients were managed with iMSPI and fusion. 33 patients were managed with SSPI and fusion. Operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, and complications were recorded. Percentage of anterior body height compression (ABHC{\%}) and sagittal index (SI) were obtained preoperatively, one week postoperatively, and at the last followup. RESULTS: The blood loss and postoperative drainage were significantly less in the iMSPI group than in SSPI group (P {\textless} 0.05). The follow-up duration of the two groups was not significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At 12 months postoperatively posterolateral fusion was obtained satisfactorily. Neither preoperative ABHC{\%} and SI nor postoperative SI were significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but there was a significant difference in postoperative ABHC{\%} (P = 0.000). The ABHC{\%} and SI were not significantly different between the two groups at the last followup (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no fixation failures or other complications. SUMMARY: IMSPI yielded satisfactory results similar to those of SSPI in patients with type A3.1/3.2 thoracolumbar fractures.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiological outcome  of the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures by using short segment posterior instrumentation (SSPI) and fusion. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The optimal surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures remains a matter of debate. SSPI is one of a number of possible choices, yet some studies have revealed high rates of poor radiological outcome for this SSPI. METHODS: Patients treated using the short segment instrumentation and fusion technique at the Spinal Injuries Center (Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan) from January 1, 2006 to July 31, 2012 were selected for this study. Radiographic parameters such as local sagittal angle, regional sagittal angle, disc angle, anterior or posterior height of the vertebral body at admission, postoperation and final observation were collected for radiological outcome evaluation. RESULTS: There were 31 patients who met the inclusion criteria with a mean follow-up duration of 22.7 months (range, 12-48 months). The mean age of this group was 47.9 years (range, 15-77 years). The mean local sagittal angles at the time of admission, post-operation and final observation were 13.1 degrees , 7.8 degrees and 14.8 degrees , respectively. There were 71{\%} good cases and 29{\%} poor cases based on our criteria for the radiological outcome evaluation. The correction loss has a strong correlation with the load sharing classification score (Spearman rho=0.64, p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The loss of kyphotic correction following the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture by short segment instrumentation is common and has a close correlation with the degree of comminution of the vertebral body. Patients with high load sharing scores are more susceptible to correction loss and postoperative kyphotic deformity than those with low scores.},

The current study involves a detailed analysis and description of patients, who were operated at a tertiary care, urban level 1 Spine Centre in India. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Various studies in literature have discussed the epidemiology and patterns of these injuries in trauma patients. However, literature describing the demographic profile and distribution of these traumata in the Indian population is scarce. METHODS: The current study was conducted as a prospective trial involving patients, who were treated at our Spine Centre in India between July 2009 to December 2012. We studied 92 patients with thoraco-lumbar spine fracture, who were operated with short or long segment posterior stabilization. Epidemiological details, pre- and post-hospitalisation care received and other injury pattern factors were studied. RESULTS: Fall from height (46 patients, 50{\%}) was the most common mechanism observed in the patients. Sixty-three percent injuries belonged to AO type A fractures, while 16.2{\%} and 19.4{\%} of the patients had suffered from AO types B and C injuries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified interesting epidemiological data and prevailing inadequacies in Emergency Spine care management in the study patients. These observations could facilitate implementation of the changes required to improve current standards of patient care.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Burst fractures of the low lumbar spine constitute approximately one percent of all lumbar fractures. There is still no consensus on the optimal treatment of low lumbar burst factures. We aimed to evaluate the functional and radiographic outcomes of conservative treatment in patients with low lumbar burst fracture. METHODS: 15 patients (11 males, 4 females; mean age 32+/-8) who had low lumbar spine burst fracture treated with a custom-moulded thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) with a thigh extension were enrolled. The mean follow-up period was 22+/-6 months. 14 patients were neurologically intact and one had isolated nerve root injury. There were 24{\%} type A fractures and 76{\%} type B fractures according to the Denis classification system. Functional outcomes were evaluated by using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Radiographic outcome was analyzed by measuring anterior vertebral height loss, kyphosis angle, amount of canal retropulsion. Functional and radiographic outcomes were reviewed initially and at 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and at the latest follow-up. Functional and radiographic improvements were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The mean bracing period was 11.9+/-1.7 weeks. The mean initial ODI, SF-36, and VAS score of the patients was 78.3+/-9.6, 23.7+/-8.9, and 8.7+/-0.7, respectively. The mean ODI, SF-36, and VAS score of the patients at the final follow-up was 26.4+/-6.5, 68.1+/-11.2, and 2.8+/-1.7, respectively. The improvement in functional outcomes was measured to be significant (p{\textless}0.05 for ODI, SF-36 and VAS). The mean initial anterior vertebral height loss, kyphosis angle, amount of canal retropulsion was found to be 27.2{\%}+/-9.6{\%}, -6.8 degrees +/-3.2 degrees , 37.4{\%}+/-10.2{\%}, respectively. The mean anterior vertebral height loss, kyphosis angle, and amount of canal retropulsion at the final follow-up was 23.1{\%}+/-.6.7{\%}, -4.2 degrees +/-2.4 degrees , 19.6{\%}+/-7.7{\%}, respectively. Among the radiographic outcomes, only the amount of canal retropulsion improved statistically (p=0.042). CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment using a custom-moulded thoracolumbosacral orthosis with a thigh extension is a safe and effective method in patients with low lumbar spine burst fractures and can improve functional and radiographic outcomes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of posterior indirect  reduction and pedicle screw fixation without laminectomy for the treatment of Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurologic deficit. METHODS: From March 2008 to May 2012, 36 consecutive patients of Denis type B thoracolumbar burst with incomplete neurologic deficit were enrolled. All of the patients accepted the treatments of posterior indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation without laminectomy. Clinical and radiologic outcomes were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Operations were performed in a relatively short time without massive hemorrhage. Their neurologic functions were improved by at least one Frankel grade. The average score of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor increased from 25.4 +/- 10.8 to 42.1 +/- 10.5, and the recovery rate of the ASIA score was also increased. The pain level was relieved for all the patients. The local kyphosis angle was reduced from 25.9 degrees +/- 3.4 degrees to 6.9 degrees +/- 2.2 degrees (P {\textless}0.05) and remained 7.9 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees (P {\textgreater} 0.05) at the latest follow-up. After the operation, the mean vertebral canal diameter increased from 5.5 +/- 1.3 to 11.1 +/- 2.2 mm (P {\textless} 0.05) and the mean canal stenosis index increased from 32.9 +/- 7.8 to 84.8 +/- 7.3{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no serious complications and fixation failures during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurologic deficit can be effectively treated by posterior indirect reduction and pedicle screw fixation without laminectomy.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE: Report the 2-year operative and clinical outcomes of these service members with low lumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The majority of spinal fractures occur at the thoracolumbar level, with fractures caudal to L2 accounting for only 1{\%} of spine fractures. A previous report from this institution regarding combat-related spine burst fractures documented an increased incidence of low lumbar burst fractures in injured service members. METHODS: Review of inpatient and outpatient medical records in addition to radiographs for all patients treated at our institution with combat-related burst fractures occurring at the L3-L5 levels. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with a mean age of 28.1+/- 7.2 underwent surgery for low lumbar (L3-L5) burst fractures. The mean number of thoracolumbar levels injured was 2.9 +/- 1.4. Eleven patients had neurological injury, 4 of which were complete. The mean days to surgery were 16.8 +/- 24.5. The mean number of levels fused was 4.3 +/- 2.1, with fixation extending to the pelvis in 4 patients (17{\%}). Fourteen (61{\%}) patients had at least 1 postoperative complication, with 7 (30{\%}) requiring reoperation. Five patients had a postoperative wound infection. Five patients had deep venous thromboses, 3 had pulmonary emboli. Mean clinical follow-up was 3.3+/- 2.2 years. At latest follow-up, all were separated from military service, 10 experienced persistent bowel/bladder dysfunction, 15 had lower extremity motor deficits, and 10 had documented persistent low back pain. Nineteen had chronic pain with 18 patients still taking pain medications and/or muscle relaxers. CONCLUSION: Low lumbar burst fractures are a rare injury with an increased incidence in combat casualties engaged in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We found a high rate of acute postoperative complications (61{\%}), as well as a high reoperation rate (30{\%}). At approximately 3 years of follow-up, most of these patients had persistent neurological symptoms and chronic pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess, using statistical analysis, if and to what extent the final outcome of surgical treatment for burst fractures depends on operation type, fracture level and initial deformity severity. METHODS: A database of 287 patients with single-vertebral-level thoracic and lumbar spine fractures analysed using simple and multiple linear regression analyses models. The dependent variable was last follow-up (LFU) kyphotic angle and the predictor variables were operation type [anterior approach (AA), posterior short-segment fixation (PSSF) and posterior monosegmental fixation (PMF)], fracture level (T11-L1, L2-L3 and L4-L5) and preoperative kyphotic angle. The models were applied on either the whole sample or on the operation type subgroups. RESULTS: In simple linear regression analysis models, fracture level accounted for 32{\%} and 18{\%} of the variation in LFU kyphotic angle in the AA and PMF subgroups, respectively. In the multiple linear regression models for the same subgroups, up to 40{\%} of the variation in LFU kyphotic angle was accounted for by fracture level. Surgical treatment, as predictor variable, indicated that patients treated by PSSF developed a post-surgical kyphotic angle 8.51 degrees more severe than those treated by AA. However, the model accounted for only 2{\%} of the variation in LFU kyphotic angle. Simple linear regressions performed on each subgroup with preoperative kyphotic angle as the independent variable revealed that the variable accounted for 15{\%} (PSSF subgroup), 17{\%} (AA subgroup) and 34{\%} (PMF subgroup) of the variation in LFU kyphotic angle. CONCLUSION: All valid regression models displayed modest explanatory power, suggesting that factors other than those taken into consideration are involved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Traditional reconstruction for burst fractures involves columnar support with posterior fixation at one or two levels cephalad/caudad; however, some surgeons choose to only stabilize the vertebral column. PURPOSE: The aim was to distinguish biomechanical differences in stability between a burst fracture stabilized through a lateral approach using corpectomy spacers of different end plate sizes with and without integrated screws and with and without posterior fixation. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was an in vitro biomechanical study assessing thoracolumbar burst fracture stabilization. METHODS: Six human spines (T11-L3) were tested on a six-degrees-of-freedom simulator enabling unconstrained range of motion (ROM) at +/-6 N.m in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR) after a simulated burst fracture at L1. Expandable corpectomy spacers with/without integrated screws (Fi/F; FORTIFY Integrated/FORTIFY; Globus Medical, Inc., Audubon, PA, USA) were tested with different end plate sizes (21x23 mm, 22x40-50 mm). Posterior instrumentation (PI) via bilateral pedicle screws and rods was used one level above and one level below the burst fracture. Lateral plate (LP) fixation was tested. Devices were tested in the following order: intact; Fi21x23; Fi21x23+PI; F21x23+PI+LP; F21x23+LP; F22x40-50+LP; F22x40-50+PI+LP; Fi22x40-50+PI; Fi22x40-50. RESULTS: In FE and AR, constructs without PI showed no significant difference (p{\textless}.05) in stability compared with intact. In LB, F22x40-50+LP showed a significant increase in stability relative to intact, but no other construct without PI reached significance. In FE and LB, circumferential constructs were significantly more stable than intact. In AR, no construct showed significant differences in motion when compared with the intact condition. CONCLUSIONS: Constructs without posterior fixation were the least stable of all tested constructs. Circumferential fixation provided greater stability in FE and LB than lateral fixation and intact. Axial rotation showed no significant differences in any construct compared with the intact state.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) is an important structure of spinal stability. The loss of vertebral body height, local kyphosis (LK), and canal compromise may lead to spinal instability. This study determined the correlations between injury of the PLL and the loss of vertebrae height, kyphosis, and canal compromise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a thoracolumbar burst fracture database was conducted from January 2009 to December 2011. Patients were divided into an intact group and a disrupted group according to the status of the PLL. The loss of vertebral height, mid-sagittal canal diameter, and LK was measured. The anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral compression ratios (AVBCR, MVBCR, and PVBCR) and mid-sagittal diameter compression ratio (MSDCR) were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the study, including 25 patients in the intact group and 22 patients in the disrupted group. There were significant differences in the AVBCR (t = -3.048, P = 0.004), MVBCR (t = -2.301, P = 0.048), PVBCR (t = -2.116, P = 0.040), and MSDCR (t = -4.095, P = 0.000) but no difference in the LK (t = 0.408, P = 0.686) between the two groups. There was a positive correlation between the injury of the PLL and the MSDCR (r = 0.428, P {\textless} 0.01), AVBCR (r = 0.372, P {\textless} 0.01), and PVBCR (r = 0.271, P {\textless} 0.05). There was no correlation between the injury of the PLL and the LK and MVBCR. CONCLUSIONS: The MVBCR and LK are not predictive of a PLL injury. The MSDCR, AVBCR, and PVBCR were associated with a PLL injury.},

In this study, we evaluated the safety and accuracy of TPS placement under intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) navigation in managing unstable TL spine fractures.From 2010 to 2013, we retrospectively reviewed the Spine Operation Registry records of patients who underwent posterior instrumented fusion to treat unstable TL spine fractures via the iCT navigation system. An unstable spine fracture was identified as AO/Magerl classification type B or type C.In all, 316 screws in 37 patients with unstable TL spine fractures were evaluated and involved 7 thoracic, 23 thoracolumbar junctional, and 7 lumbar fractures. The accuracy of TPS positioning in the pedicle without breach was 98{\%} (310/316). The average number of iCT scans per patient was 2.1 (range 2-3). The average total radiation dose to patients was 15.8 mSv; the dose per single level exposure was 2.7 mSv. The TPS intraoperative revision rate was 0.6{\%} (2/316) and no neurovascular sequela was observed. TPS fixation using the iCT navigation system obtained a 98{\%} accuracy in stabilizing unstable TL spine fractures. A malplaced TPS could be revised during real-time confirmation of the TPS position, and no secondary operation was required to revise malplaced screws.The iCT navigation system provides accurate and safe management of unstable TL spine fractures. In addition, operating room personnel, including surgeons and nurses, did not need to wear heavy lead aprons as they were not exposed to radiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of a L5 transverse process fracture is reported in many  texts to be a marker of pelvis fracture instability. There is paucity of literature to support this view. Only two previous studies have been performed on this subject with statistical analysis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional review of all abdominopelvic CT scans performed for blunt abdominal trauma in a Level 1 Trauma Unit between January 2012 and August 2013. A total of 203 patients met our inclusion criteria. Fifty four (54) of these patients had an associated pelvis fracture. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients with pelvis fractures 26 (48{\%}) had an unstable fracture (AO Type B and C) and 28 (52{\%}) had a stable pelvis fracture (AO Type A). Five (19{\%}) of the 26 patients with an unstable pelvis fracture had an associated L5 transverse process fracture. This association was not statistically significant (P=0.724). Seven (12{\%}) of the 28 patients with a stable fracture pattern had an associated L5 transverse process fracture. Three patients (2{\%}) had an L5 transverse fracture in the absence of a demonstrable pelvis fracture. The relative risk of an unstable pelvis fracture in the presence of a L5 transverse process fracture is 1.2 (CI 0.6 2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of an L5 transverse process fracture on an abdominopelvic CT scan is strongly associated with an underlying pelvis fracture (P{\textless}0.001). Statistically, its presence however does not strongly predict instability (P=0.724). The latter finding differs from the previously published studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive treatment of vertebral fractures is basically characterized by cement augmentation. Using the combination of a permanent implant plus cement, it is now conceivable that the amount of cement can be reduced and so this augmentation could be an attractive opportunity for use in traumatic fractures in young and middle-aged patients. The objective of this study was to determine the smallest volume of cement necessary to stabilize fractured vertebrae comparing the SpineJack system to the gold standard, balloon kyphoplasty. METHODS: 36 fresh frozen human cadaveric vertebral bodies (T11-L3) were utilized. After creating typical compression wedge fractures (AO A1.2.1), the vertebral bodies were reduced by SpineJack (n=18) or kyphoplasty (n=18) under preload (100N). Subsequently, different amounts of bone cement (10{\%}, 16{\%} or 30{\%} of the vertebral body volume) were inserted. Finally, static and dynamic biomechanical tests were performed. FINDINGS: Following augmentation and fatigue tests, vertebrae treated with SpineJack did not show any significant loss of intraoperative height gain, in contrast to kyphoplasty. In the 10{\%} and 16{\%}-group the height restoration expressed as a percentage of the initial height was significantly increased with the SpineJack ({\textgreater}300{\%}). Intraoperative SpineJack could preserve the maximum height gain (mean 1{\%} height loss) better than kyphoplasty (mean 16{\%} height loss). INTERPRETATION: In traumatic wedge fractures it is possible to reduce the amount of cement to 10{\%} of the vertebral body volume when SpineJack is used without compromising the reposition height after reduction, in contrast to kyphoplasty that needs a 30{\%} cement volume.},

All patients had previously asymptomatic spines prior to their fractures and had a single level thoracolumbar burst fracture of more than 20 degrees kyphosis.

The metalwork was removed between 6 months and 1 year post operatively to remobilise the spinal segments. All patients were then evaluated at least 6 months after metal work removal and at 18 months post fracture using radiographs and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Those patients treated with MIS techniques demonstrated superior outcomes compared to traditional open techniques and conservative methods of treatment, with significantly reduced hospital stay, better return to work {\&} leisure, and the best chance of restoring their spine to near its pre-injury status. We would recommend MIS techniques as the best way of treating single level thoracolumbar spinal fractures. There is a significant improvement in ODI when treated by MIS over open surgical methods.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. OBJECTIVE: To assess (1) the evolution of vertebral bone marrow edema (VBME) in patients with A1 vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) conservatively treated and (2) the relationship between VBME and clinical symptoms, evaluated as Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) back pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VBME is a marker of acute-subacute vertebral fractures. Little is known about the evolution of VBME in conservatively managed VCFs, as well as its clinical meaning. METHODS: 82 thoracic or lumbar VCFs (21 post-traumatic; 61 osteoporotic VCFs), type A1 according to the AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system, in 80 patients were treated with C35 hyperextension brace for 3 months, bed rest for the first 25 days. Patients with osteoporotic fractures also received antiresorptive therapy and vitamin D supplementation. At 0 (T0), 30 (T1), 60 (T2), and 90 (T3) days, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and clinical evaluation, using VAS for pain and ODI.The paired t test was used to compare changes within groups at each follow-up versus baseline. The unpaired t test after ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to compare the 2 groups at each follow-up.The association between VBME area, VAS score, and ODI score was analyzed by the Pearson correlation test. The tests were 2-tailed with a confidence level of 5{\%}. RESULTS: A significant VBME mean area, VAS, and ODI scores reduction was recorded at 60 and 90-days follow-ups versus baseline. A positive correlation between VBME reduction and clinical symptoms improvement (VAS and ODI scores improvement) was found in both traumatic and osteoporotic VCFs. CONCLUSION: In benign A1 VCFs conservatively managed, VBME slowly decreases in the first 3 months of magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. This VBME reduction is related to clinical symptoms improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether kyphoplasty is an adequate stand-alone treatment for restoring biomechanical stability in the spine after experiencing high-energy vertebral burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty in the treatment of high-energy vertebral burst fractures has been shown by previous studies to significantly improve stiffness when used in conjunction with pedicle screw instrumentation. However, it is not known whether kyphoplasty as a stand-alone treatment may be an acceptable method for restoring biomechanical stability of a spinal motion segment post-burst fracture while allowing flexibility of the motion segment through the intervertebral discs. METHODS: Young cadaveric spines (15-50 yr old; 3 males and 1 female; bone mineral density 0.27-0.31 gHA/cm) were divided into motion segments consisting of 3 intact vertebrae separated by 2 intervertebral discs (T11-L1 and L2-L4). Mechanical testing in axial, flexion/extension, lateral bending, and torsion was performed on each specimen in an intact state, after an experimentally simulated burst fracture and postkyphoplasty. Computed tomography was used to confirm the burst fractures and quantify cement placement. RESULTS: Between the intact and burst-fractured states significant decreases in stiffness were seen in all loading modes (63{\%}-69{\%}). Burst fracture increased the average angulation of the vertebral endplates 147{\%} and decreased vertebral body height by an average of 40{\%}. Postkyphoplasty, only small recoveries in stiffness were seen in axial, flexion/extension, and lateral bending (4{\%}-12{\%}), with no improvement in torsional stiffness. Large angular deformations (85{\%}) and height loss (31{\%}) remained postkyphoplasty as compared with the intact state. CONCLUSION: Lack of overall improvement in biomechanical stiffness indicates failure of kyphoplasty to sufficiently restore stability as a stand-alone treatment after high-energy burst fracture. The lack of stability can be explained by an inability to biomechanically repair the compromised intervertebral discs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {This study aim to determine the correlation between the size of bone fragment and injury of posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). In this study retrospectively analyze medical chart of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures from June 2010 to December 2012. Patients were divided into two groups (Intact group and Disrupted group) according to the result of MRI assessing status of PLL. All the fractures were classified according to the Arbeit Fuer Osteoosynthese (AO) classification system. Neurological status was classified according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). Mimics measured the height and width of bone fragment (HBF and WBF), transverse canal diameter (TCD) and calculate the height of posterior wall of the injury vertebrae, ratio of height of bone fragment occupying height of posterior wall of vertebrae body (RHBF) and ratio of width of bone fragment occupying transverse canal diameter (RWBF). The results indicated that 52 patients were included in the study. There are 31 patients with intact PLL and 21 patients with disrupted PLL. There was significant difference on the HBF (t = -3.646, P = 0.001), WBF (t = -3.615, P = 0.001), RHBF (t = -4.124, P = 0.000) and RWBF (t = -3.305, P = 0.002) between the intact group and injury group. There was a significant correlation between injury of PLL and ASIA grade (OR = 7.851, P = 0.005), and AO classification (OR = 6.401, P = 0.011), and RHBF (OR = 6.455, P = 0.011), and HBF (OR = 5.208, P = 0.022). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that AO classification, ASIA grade, HBF and RHBF could act as the predictors of injury of PLL.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summary the characteristics of cervicothoracic junction (C7T1) fracture-dislocation,and explore the surgical treatment of combined anterior-posterior procedure. METHODS: From January 2005 to March 2010,8 cases of cervicothoracic junction (C7T1) fracture-dislocation were treated by stage I operation through anterior and posterior approacheg, supplemented by non-structural bone graft. All patients were male with a mean age of 45.0 years old ranging from 32 to 68 years. Six cases were diagnosed clearly by CT scan but with normal cervical spine X-ray film at admission. According to AO classification, 4 cases were of type B, 4 cases of type C, with unilateral locked articular process in 2 cases, bilateral in 2 cases. Preoperative MRI showed intervertebral disc injury in 6 cases. RESULTS: The average operation time was 246.3 min ranging from 150 to 320 min. The blood loss was with an average of 307.5 ml (150 to 600 ml). One patient got hoarseness but recovered without special treatment 6 months later; No other complications happened. One patient of preoperative Frankel grade A died, the remaining patients were followed up from 12 to 63 months (38.6 months in average). These fracture-dislocations were completely reduction after operation, healed with bony union 12 months later, and no pseudoarthrosis. The function of the spinal cord improved obviously at the final follow-up, 1 patient of preoperative grade A had died,and the spinal cord function of the other one had no significant changes,the 2 cases of grade B recovered to C and D respectively, 1case recovered from grade C to D, and 3 case recovered from D to E. CONCLUSION: Cervicothoracic junction (C7T1) fracture-dislocation is a rare clinical spine trauma, and missed easily. The CT is a necessary complement to these patients highly suspected C7T1 fracture-dislocation but with negative cervical spine X-ray film. The patients diagnosed clearly could receive stage I operation of anterior and posterior approaches, supplemented with non-structural bone graft.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Survey of spine surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To develop a validated regional and global injury severity scoring system for thoracolumbar trauma. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System was recently published and combines elements of both the Magerl system and the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System; however, the injury severity of each fracture has yet to be established. METHODS: A survey was sent to 100 AOSpine members from all 6 AO regions of the world (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East). Each respondent was asked to numerically grade the severity of each variable of the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System including the morphology, neurological grade, and patient specific modifiers. A grade of zero was considered to be not severe at all, and a grade of 100 was the most severe injury possible. RESULTS: Seventy-four AOSpine surgeons from all 6 AO regions of the world numerically graded the severity of each variable of the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System to establish the injury severity score. The reported fracture severity increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) as the subtypes of fracture type A and type B increased, and a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.0001) in severity was established for burst fractures with involvement of 2 versus 1 endplates. Finally, no regional or experiential difference in severity or classification was identified. CONCLUSION: Development of a globally applicable injury severity scoring system for thoracolumbar trauma is possible. This study demonstrates no regional or experiential difference in perceived severity or thoracolumbar spine trauma. The AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System provides a logical approach to assessing these injuries and enables rational strategies for treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: Spinal injuries of the survivors of an airplane crash are described. On the basis of injury morphology and knowledge of the conditions of the accident, injury mechanisms are described and prevention measures are discussed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The most common causes of spinal fractures are a high energy fall (incidence 21.2{\%}-39{\%}) and motor vehicle accidents (21.7{\%}-33.61{\%}). Detailed reports solely on spinal injuries, as a result of an airplane crash, are scarce in literature. METHODS: An analysis was performed on the spinal injuries of all 126 survivors of a commercial airplane (Boeing 737) crash near Amsterdam in 2009. Level of injury and fracture classification by morphology, independently performed by 4 specialists in spinal trauma, was documented. An analysis was done on the type of injuries and the suggested mechanism of injury by evaluating the crash characteristics analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three (18.3{\%}) of the survivors sustained a total of 27 spinal injuries. Four (17.1{\%} of the patients with spinal injury) experienced a single cervical spine fracture. Eight (29.6{\%}) injuries were at the thoracic spine and 15 (55.6{\%}) at the lumbar spine level. More than half of the injuries included a burst component. CONCLUSION: A high number of spinal injuries was found after this airplane crash. The morphology of the injuries consisted of a high rate of burst-type fractures presumably caused by a mainly vertical trauma mechanism as shown by the accident analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) is not very reliable for assessment of injury to the posterior ligament complex, even when scored by experts. It is not reasonable to score every compression fracture or burst fracture the same as there is great variety in the severity of compression fractures and burst fractures. PURPOSE: To propose a modified TLICS (mTLICS) and evaluate the performance of the mTLICS system by measuring the agreement between scores determined by radiologists using both systems and actual treatment procedure delivered. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 134 patients with acute lumbar and thoracic spinal trauma after undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using new mTLICS and conventional TLICS system. Inter-observer agreements of TLICS and mTLICS scores were analyzed using the kappa statistic. Nonparametric correlation analysis was used to determine correlation (R) among each score and the surgical intervention. RESULTS: The mTLICS system showed slightly higher correlation than TLICS (Rs, TLICS, 0.592 and 0.613 vs. mTLICS, 0.628 and 0.639). If we consider a total maximal score of 4 to be a negative surgical indication, mTLICS showed significantly higher sensitivities than TLICS, and if we consider a total minimal score of 4 to be a positive surgical indication, mTLICS showed significantly higher specificities than TLICS. CONCLUSION: The mTLICS score corrects deficiencies in the TLICS system that lead to ambiguity in the radiological diagnostic criteria. mTLICS is a more suitable scoring system than TLICS for predicting surgical management accurately, especially for morphological injuries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study clinical effects of short-segment fixation and injured vertebra bone grafting through injured pedicle for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures under MAST Quadrant retractor via a paraspinal muscle approach. METHODS: The data of 42 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures treated from June 2009 to September 2012 were reviewed. There were 19 males and 23 females, with an average age of (55.2+/-11.9) years old. The mean injury time was (5.8+/-4.3) days. Fracture segments included T10 in 3 cases, T11 in 6 cases, T12 in 13 cases, L1 in 9 cases, L2 in 7 cases, and L3 in 4 cases. According to Denis classification, 9 patients were type A, 21 patients were type B, 5 patiens were type C, 5 patients were type D, and 2 patients were type E. All the patients were treated with short-segment pedicle screw-rod system fixation under MAST Quadrant via the paraspinal muscle approach. The operative time, blood loss, complications and the height of vertebra, kyphosis Cobb angle, VAS scores, JOA scores were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the vertebral height and kyphosis Cobb angle were restored. Compared with preoperative results, postoperative vertebral height and kyphosis Cobb angle, VAS scores and JOA scores were all improved. But there was no statistically significance in vertebral height, kyphosis Cobb angle between postoperative at 1 week and 1 year. CONCLUSION: Internal fixation combined with injured vertebra bone grafting through the injured pedicle for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures via the paraspinal intermuscular approach under MAST Quadrant is a safe, minimally invasive, effective and satisfactory method.},

OBJECTIVES.: To compare the results of the combined anterior-posterior surgery (Group A) with posterior "short-segment" transpedicular fixation (SSTF) (Group B) in mid-lumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are no comparative randomized clinical studies on the outcome following operative treatment of mid-lumbar fractures. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with L2-L4 fresh single A3-type/AO burst fractures and load sharing score up to 6 were randomly selected to underwent either combined one-stage anterior stabilization with mesh cage and SSTF (Group A) or solely SSTF with intermediate screws in the fractured vertebra (Group B). Kyphotic Gardner angle, anterior and posterior vertebral body height (PVBHr, AVBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), SF-36, VAS, and Frankel classification were used. RESULTS: The follow-up observation averaged 46 and 48 months for Group A and B, respectively. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were significant more in Group A. More surgical complications were observed in the Group A. After surgery, VAS was reduced to 4.3 and 3.6 for Group A and Group B, respectively. The SF-36 domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in Group B (P = 0.05) and (P = 0.06), respectively. Correction of AVBHr, PVBHr, and spinal canal clearance was similar in both groups. Spinal canal clearance did not differ between the two groups, but it was continuous until the last evaluation in Group B. The final Gardner angle loss of correction averaged 2 degrees and 5 degrees for Group A and Group B, respectively. The posttraumatic Gardner deformity did not significantly improve by SSTF at the final evaluation in the spines of Group B. Gardner angle correlated significantly with SCE in Group B and Group A in all three periods and in the last evaluation, respectively. Frankel grade did not correlate with loss of correction of AVBHr and PVBHr in Group A, while it significantly correlated with loss of PVBHr correction and SCE in the patients of Group B. There was no neurologic deterioration after surgery in any patient. VAS and SF-36 scores did not significantly correlate with the loss of kyphotic angle correction and AVBHr, PVBHr at the final observation in any patient of both groups. CONCLUSIONS: SSTF offered similar significant short-term correction of posttraumatic deformities associated with mid-lumbar A3-burst fractures, but better clinical results as compared to combined surgery. However, SSTF did not significantly maintain the after surgery achieved correction of local posttraumatic kyphosis at the final evaluation. Thus, SSTF is not recommended for operative stabilization of fractures with this severity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A prospective randomized study was conducted to determine whether there exist any differences in radiographic, clinical, or functional outcomes when individuals with stable burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction without neurologic deficit are treated with either a posterior fusion with instrumentation or anterior reconstruction, fusion, and instrumentation. There exists relatively little literature evaluating the outcomes of individuals treated with anterior surgery, and no prospective randomized studies exist comparing the two treatment approaches. METHODS: From May 1995 to March 2001, a consecutive series of subjects with acute isolated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) without neurologic deficit were randomized to receive either an anterior fusion with instrumentation or a posterior fusion with instrumentation. Radiographs including computed tomography (CT) were obtained. Radiographs were repeated at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months. The CT scan was also repeated at 24 months. Hospital stay, cost, operating time, blood loss, complications, and patient-related functional outcomes were measured. RESULTS: Of 43 enrolled, 38 completed a minimum of 2-year follow-up (average: 43 months; range: 24-108 months). Eighteen received a posterior spine fusion and 20 an anterior approach. Hospital stay and operating time were similar. Blood loss was higher in the group treated anteriorly; however, the incidence of transfusion was the same. There were 17 "complications" including instrumentation removal for pain in 18 patients treated posteriorly, but only 3 minor complications in 3 patients treated anteriorly. Patient-related functional outcomes were similar for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient outcomes are similar, anterior fusion and instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures may present fewer complications or additional surgeries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Short-segment (SS) pedicle fixation has become a popular treatment option. However, there are several studies regarding the high rate of failure. The aim of this prospective study was to compare SS versus long-segment (LS) instrumentation. METHODS: For this purpose, 18 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included nine patients treated by SS pedicle fixation, whereas group 2 included nine patients treated by LS instrumentation. SS instrumentation was pedicle fixation one level above and below the fractured vertebra. LS instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra. RESULTS: As a result, measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index, and anterior vertebral height compression showed that the LS group had a better outcome at final follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05). Also, the SS group had a 55{\%} failure rate, whereas the LS group had prolonged operative time and increased blood loss. However, there was no difference between the two groups according to Low Back Outcome Score. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, radiographic parameters demonstrated that LS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Nevertheless, clinical outcome was the same between the two groups. However, our conclusions were based on posterior-only surgery. Anterior column support would negate the need for LS fixation. Also, SS would have been more successful if two above and two below pedicle screws were used.},

abstract = {A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98). Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively. According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66{\%} of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29{\%} of type B, and 5{\%} of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Bohler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program. All fractures in the conservative group were of type A. At follow-up of all operated cases, the local gibbus angle had improved by a reduction of on average 18.6 degrees and was followed by a loss of correction of 12.5 degrees ending in a final gain of 6.1 degrees at follow-up. At follow-up of the conservatively treated cases, the local gibbus angle showed an improvement of 11.1 degrees at reduction and a loss of correction of 14.9 degrees after reduction. The remaining result was -3.6 degrees, that means an increase of kyphoses compared to the x-ray at admission. In order to be able to compare two homogeneous groups only fractures of type A were used. Comparison of the two groups showed an improvement of the vertebral body angle of 70{\%} (11.3 degrees) after reduction in the surgical group and 46{\%} (6.1 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The subsequent loss of correction was 19{\%} (3 degrees) in the surgical and 34{\%} (4.5 degrees) in the conservatively treated group. The remaining gain at follow-up was 51{\%} (8.3 degrees) in the surgical and only 12{\%} (1.6 degrees) in the conservative group. The local gibbus angle had improved on average by 17.1 degrees after reduction in the surgical and by 11.1 degrees in the conservatively treated group. Loss of correction was 71{\%} (12.2 degrees) and 132{\%} (14.9 degrees), respectively. The final result at follow-up showed a decrease of kyphosis of 4.9 degrees in the surgical and an increase of kyphosis of 3.7 degrees in the conservatively treated group. The difference was significant. Within the surgical group, 75{\%} of the loss of correction was caused by the discs and 25{\%} by the vertebral body. In the conservatively treated group it was 69{\%} and 31{\%}, respectively. Concerning loss of correction, no difference was seen between patients with and without intercorporal bone grafting. There was no relationship between radiological and clinical outcome. Whereas 15{\%} of the patients of the surgical group were not satisfied or moderately satisfied with the result, all patients in the conservatively treated group were satisfied or very satisfied. Based on the good clinical results of the conservative treatment we can conclude that in stable fractures without severe deformity, and in patients who are in bad general condition, conservative treatment can considered as an alternative to surgical treatment.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized study comparing two treatment methods for thoracolumbar burst fractures: short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting and the same procedure without transpedicular grafting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of transpedicular grafting in preventing failure of short-segment fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Short-segment pedicle instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures is known to fail early because of the absence of anterior support. Additional transpedicular grafting has been offered as an alternative to prevent this failure. However, there is controversy about the results of transpedicular grafting. METHODS: Twenty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included in the study. The inclusion criterion was the presence of fractures through the T11-L3 vertebrae without neurologic compromise. The patients were randomized by a simple method into two groups. Group 1 patients were treated using short-segment instrumentation with transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n = 10), and Group 2 patients were treated by short-segment fixation alone (NTPG) (n = 10). Clinical (Likert's questionnaire) and radiologic (sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and local kyphosis) outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in local kyphosis and/or screw breakage, was also not significantly different (TPG = 50{\%}, NTPG = 40{\%}, P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment transpedicular instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures is associated with a high rate of failure that cannot be decreased by additional transpedicular intracorporeal grafting.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To compare  the results of fusion versus nonfusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The operative results of surgically treated burst fractures with short segmental fixation have been well documented. There is no report comparing the results of fusion and nonfusion. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, with the inclusion criteria as follows: neurologically intact spine with a kyphotic angle {\textgreater} or = 20 degrees, decreased vertebral body height {\textgreater} or = 50{\%} or a canal compromise {\textgreater} or = 50{\%}, incomplete neurologic deficit with a canal compromise 50{\%}, complete neurologic deficit, and multilevel spinal injury or multiple traumas. All patients were randomly assigned to fusion or nonfusion groups, and operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation was carried out. Posterior fusion with autogenous bone graft was performed for the fusion group (n = 30), and no fusion procedure was done for the nonfusion group (n = 28). The average follow-up period was 41 months (range, 24-71 months). RESULTS: The average loss of kyphotic angle was not statistically significant between these 2 groups. The radiographic parameters were statistically significantly better in the nonfusion group, including angular change in the flexion-extension lateral view (4.8 degrees vs. 1.0 degrees), lost correction of decreased vertebral body height (3.6{\%} vs. 8.3{\%}), intraoperative estimated blood loss (303 mL vs. 572 mL), and operative time (162 minutes vs. 224 minutes). The scores on the low back outcome scale were not statistically significant for these 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term results of short segmental fixation without fusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were satisfactory. The advantages of instrumentation without fusion are the elimination of donor site complications, saving more motion segments, and reducing blood loss and operative time.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The overall evidence for nonoperative management of patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is unknown. There is no agreement on the optimal method of conservative treatment. Recent randomized controlled trials that have compared nonoperative to operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficits yielded conflicting results. By assessing the level of evidence on conservative management through validated methodologies, clinicians can assess the availability of critically appraised literature. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of evidence for the use of conservative management in traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the English literature over the past 20 years was conducted using PubMed (MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria consisted of burst fractures resulting from a traumatic mechanism, and fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine. The exclusion criteria consisted of osteoporotic burst fractures, pathological burst fractures, and fractures located in the cervical spine. Of the studies meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, any study in which nonoperative treatment was used was included in this review. RESULTS: One thousand ninety-eight abstracts were reviewed and 447 papers met inclusion/exclusion criteria, of which 45 were included in this review. In total, there were 2 Level-I, 7 Level-II, 9 Level-III, 25 Level-IV, and 2 Level-V studies. Of the 45 studies, 16 investigated conservative management techniques, 20 studies compared operative to nonoperative treatments, and 9 papers investigated the prognosis of conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: There are 9 high-level studies (Levels I-II) that have investigated the conservative management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. In neurologically intact patients, there is no superior conservative management technique over another as supported by a high level of evidence. The conservative technique can be based on patient and surgeon preference, comfort, and access to resources. A high level of evidence demonstrated similar functional outcomes with conservative management when compared with open surgical operative management in patients who were neurologically intact. The presence of a neurological deficit is not an absolute contraindication for conservative treatment as supported by a high level of evidence. However, the majority of the literature excluded patients with neurological deficits. More evidence is needed to further classify the appropriate burst fractures for conservative management to decrease variables that may impact the prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burst fractures account for more than half of all thoracolumbar fractures, which often cause a neurologic deficit and present a significant economic burden to the family and society. Accepted methods of treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures include conservative therapy, posterior reduction and instrumentation, and anterior decompression and instrumentation. However, the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures has been the subject of much controversy. METHODS: Publications reporting clinical data relating to the thoracolumbar burst fractures were reviewed. These articles were determined via review of the results of PubMed searches and articles gathered through compilation of references from those articles. RESULTS: There exist different criteria for the choice of the management based on the severity of kyphotic deformity, canal compromise, vertebral height loss, and neurologic status. To our knowledge, none of the existing criteria for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures are generally accepted. CONCLUSIONS: In thoracolumbar burst fractures without a neurologic deficit, there is no superiority of conservative therapy over operative therapy. When the neurologic involvement is significant, the choice of operative management is advised. Also, there is no obvious superiority of one approach over the other.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability of three methods of internal fixation (Harrington rods, AO internal fixator, posterior segmental fixator) to obtain reduction of intracanal fragments in thoracolumbar vertebral compression burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sixty-seven acute thoracolumbar compression burst fractures of T12 or L1 were randomized into three groups that were treated using one of the three methods. Reduction was accomplished indirectly by distraction applied using the fixation device. METHODS: The spinal canal encroachment was calculated as a percentage of the estimated pre-injury value from serial transverse computed tomographic scans obtained on admission and immediately after surgery. RESULTS: The median preoperative sagittal encroachment of the spinal canal was 37{\%} (range, 0-90{\%}) of the normal diameter. All three methods of internal fixation produced a spinal canal clearance provided that the patient was operated on within 4 days after trauma. The median postoperative encroachment varied from 13{\%} (range, 0-37{\%}) to 22{\%} (range, 0-37{\%}), the best reduction being attained using Harrington rods and the poorest with the posterior segmental fixator. There was a suggestive statistical significance between these two. CONCLUSION: The differences in postoperative spinal canal encroachment and ability to obtain spinal canal clearance observed between the devices studied were small. There seems to be no reason to base the choice of the operative method in thoracolumbar fractures on any hypothetical differences in reductive power between Harrington rods and the AO internal fixator.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature on operative and nonoperative treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and no neurological deficit. METHODS: In their search of the literature, the authors identified all possible relevant studies concerning thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurological deficit. Two independent observers performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction in a blinded and objective manner for all papers identified during the search. In a synthesis of the literature, the authors obtained evidence for both operative and nonoperative treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the superiority of one approach over the other as measured using generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life scales. There is no scientific evidence linking posttraumatic kyphosis to clinical outcomes. The authors found that there is a strong need for improved clinical research methodology to be applied to this patient population.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial was conducted. OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of nonoperative treatment versus short-segment posterior fixation using pedicle screws. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A previous study showed that nonoperative treatment with early mobilization produced good results, even when the posterior column was involved. METHODS: This study involved 80 patients. Inclusion criteria required the following: neurologically intact patient, single-level closed burst fracture involving T11-L2, no fracture dislocations or pedicle fractures, age of 18 to 65 years (nonpathologic adult), and no other major organ system or musculoskeletal injuries. Patients in the nonoperative group (n = 47) were allowed activity to the point of pain tolerance beginning on the day of injury using a hyperextension brace. Patients in the operative group (n = 33) underwent three-level, (one above, one at fracture level, and one below) fixation using VSP or TSRH instrumentation. The follow-up period was 2 years. RESULTS: The surgical group had less pain up to 3 months and a better Greenough Low Back Outcome Score up to 6 months, but the outcome was similar afterward. No neurologic deficit in any patient. In the nonoperative group, the kyphosis angle worsened by 4 degrees, and the retropulsion decreased from 34{\%} to 15{\%}. In the operative group, there was one case of superficial infection and two cases of broken screws. The kyphosis angle was improved initially by 17 degrees, but this was gradually lost. Hospital charges were four times higher in the operative group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment posterior fixation provides partial kyphosis correction and earlier pain relief, but the functional outcome at 2 years is similar. Early activity to the point of pain tolerance can be safely allowed.},

Transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in combination with short-segment instrumentation has been offered as an alternative to prevent failure. However, concern still remains about the potential complication of further canal narrowing or failure of remodeling with this technique. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the effect of transpedicular intracorporeal grafting on spinal canal restoration and remodeling in a group of patients treated with short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-one patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomised into transpedicular grafting (TPG) (n=11) and non-transpedicular grafting (NTPG) (n=10) groups, and were prospectively followed for an average of 50 months (range 25-85 months). Groups were similar in age, type of fracture, load sharing classification and kyphotic deformity. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomographic (CT) images through the level of pedicles were obtained, corrected for differences in magnification, and digitized. Areas of the spinal canals were measured and normalized by the estimated area at that level (average of adjacent levels). Average kyphosis was 19.7 degrees+/-6.2 degrees at presentation, was corrected to 1.9 degrees+/-4.9 degrees by operation, but was found to have deteriorated to 9.1 degrees+/-6.4 degrees at final follow-up. There were no differences between groups regarding the evolution of sagittal deformity. Spinal canal narrowing was 38.5+/-18.2{\%} at presentation, 22.1+/-19.8{\%} postoperatively, and it further improved to -2.5+/-16.7{\%} at follow-up, similar for both groups. Our results demonstrate that transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in the treatment of burst fractures does not have a detectable effect on the rate of reconstruction of the canal area or on remodeling. Spinal canal remodeling was observed to occur in all patients regardless of grafting.},

abstract = {AIM: To compare the anterior and posterior surgical approach in the emergency treatment of unstable burst thoracolumbar fracture. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with unstable thoracolumbar fracture underwent either anterior neurodecompression and fixation (n=13) or posterior reposition and semirigid fixation by hook-rod with pedicle screw fixation (n=12), depending on the type of implants available at the time of operation. Neurologically injured patients were operated on within the first 8 hours and neurologically intact patients within the first 2 days after the fracture. Neurological improvement was assessed according to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale and the Prolo economic/function outcome scale. We also recorded operation time, blood loss, cosmetic outcome, hospital stay and cost, complications, and donor site pain. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups in either neurological improvement (p=0.86) or favorable economic or function outcome (p=0.54 and p=0.53, respectively). The operation time was shorter in the posterior approach group than in the anterior approach group (median 174 min, range 130-215 vs median 250 min, range 200-295, respectively, p{\textless}0.001). The blood loss was smaller in the posterior approach group (median 750 mL, range 500-1,10, vs median 1,362 mL, range 1,150-1,50, in the anterior approach group; p{\textless}0.001). The posterior approach group also had better esthetic outcome, lower hospital cost, lower complication rate, and no donor site pain. CONCLUSION: Both surgical techniques were equally effective in neurological improvement and functional outcome. Posterior surgery can be recommended in emergency neurodecompression and fixation of unstable thoracolumbar fractures because of the shorter operation time and smaller blood loss.},

abstract = {Study Design Systematic literature review. Objective The management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF) remains challenging, and analyzing the levels of evidence (LOEs) for treatment practices can reform the decision-making process. However, no review has yet evaluated the operative management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures with particular attention placed on LOE from an established methodology. The objective of the present study was to characterize the literature evidence for TLBF, specifically for operative management. Methods A comprehensive search of the English literature over the past 20 years was conducted using PubMed (MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria consisted of (1) traumatic burst fractures (2) in the thoracic or lumbar spine. Exclusion criteria included (1) osteoporotic burst fractures, (2) pathologic burst fractures, (3) cervical fractures, (4) biomechanical studies or those involving cadavers, and (5) computer-based studies. Studies were assigned an LOE and those meeting level 1 or 2 were included. Results From 1,138 abstracts, 272 studies met the criteria. Twenty-three studies (8.5{\%}) met level 1 (n = 4, 1.5{\%}) or 2 (n = 19, 7.0{\%}) criteria. All 23 studies were reported. Conclusions The literature contains a high LOE to support the operative management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. For patients who are neurologically intact, a high LOE demonstrated similar functional outcomes, lower complication rates, and less costs with conservative management when compared with surgical management. There is a high LOE for short- or long-segment pedicle instrumentation without fusion and less invasive (percutaneous and paraspinal) approaches. Furthermore, the posterior approaches are associated with lower complications as opposed to the anterior or combined approaches.},

abstract = {The authors instituted a prospective, randomized study of patients presenting with acute burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. Patients were alternately treated by posterior distraction using pedicle instrumentation (AO fixateur interne) or anterior decompression and instrumentation (Kostuik-Harrington device). Forty patients are presented with a mean follow-up of 20 months. Preoperatively, there was significant canal compromise in 39 patients. This measured 44.5{\%} in those patients undergoing posterior surgery and 58{\%} in those patients undergoing anterior surgery. Postoperatively, this was reduced to 16.5{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference between these two groups (P less than 0.0001). The mean preoperative kyphotic deformity was 18.7 degrees in those patients treated by anterior surgery and 18.2 degrees in the group treated by posterior surgery. At last follow-up, the mean improvement in kyphotic deformity was 9.3 degrees in the anterior group and 11.3 degrees in the posterior group. There is no statistically significant difference between these two groups. There were two implant failures of the anterior Kostuik-Harrington construct and two implant failures of the AO fixateur interne. Blood loss was significantly higher in the patients undergoing anterior surgery, but there were no complications from thoracotomy and anterior decompression of the dural sac. This study supports the hypothesis that posterior distraction instrumentation can effectively decompress the canal and correct kyphosis in patients sustaining burst-type injuries. Anterior surgery, however, results in a more complete and reliable decompression of the canal.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Clinical trial (phase II). OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon vertebroplasty after posterior short-segment reduction and fixation for the treatment of traumatic burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Hardware failure and loss of reduction after posterior short-segment instrumentation are complications caused by insufficiency of anterior column support. This is due to migration of disc tissue through the endplate into the fractured vertebral body that cannot be restored with posterior instrumentation. METHODS: Patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were included. After posterior reduction and fixation, bilateral transpedicular balloon reduction of the endplate was performed, and calcium phosphate cement was injected. Preoperative and postoperative Cobb angle and central and anterior height were assessed with radiographs and MRI. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent surgery without technical difficulties, and a substantial reduction of the endplates could be achieved with the technique. All patients recovered uneventfully, and the neurologic examination revealed no deficits. The postoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone defect without unwarranted bone displacement. The central and anterior height of the vertebral body could be restored to 78 and 91{\%} of the estimated intact height, respectively. Complications were cement leakage in five cases without clinical implications and one wound hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular balloon vertebroplasty for the direct restoration of burst fractures seems feasible in combination with posterior instrumentation. Cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Thoracolumbar spine injuries are commonly encountered in patients with trauma, accounting for almost 90{\%} of all spinal fractures. Thoracolumbar burst fractures comprise a high percentage of these traumatic fractures (45{\%}), and approximately half of the patients with this injury pattern are neurologically intact. However, a debate over complication rates associated with operative versus nonoperative management of various thoracolumbar fracture morphologies is ongoing, particularly concerning those patients presenting without a neurological deficit. METHODS: A MEDLINE search for pertinent literature published between 1966 and December 2013 was conducted by 2 authors (G.G. and R.D.), who used 2 broad search terms to maximize the initial pool of manuscripts for screening. These terms were "operative lumbar spine adverse events" and "nonoperative lumbar spine adverse events." RESULTS: In an advanced MEDLINE search of the term "operative lumbar spine adverse events" on January 8, 2014, 1459 results were obtained. In a search of "nonoperative lumbar spine adverse events," 150 results were obtained. After a review of all abstracts for relevance to traumatic thoracolumbar spinal injuries, 62 abstracts were reviewed for the "operative" group and 21 abstracts were reviewed for the "nonoperative" group. A total of 14 manuscripts that met inclusion criteria for the operative group and 5 manuscripts that met criteria for the nonoperative group were included. There were a total of 919 and 436 patients in the operative and nonoperative treatment groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to age, sex, and length of stay. The mean ages were 43.17 years in the operative and 34.68 years in the nonoperative groups. The majority of patients in both groups were Frankel Grade E (342 and 319 in operative and nonoperative groups, respectively). Among the studies that reported the data, the mean length of stay was 14 days in the operative group and 20.75 in the nonoperative group. The incidence of all complications in the operative and nonoperative groups was 300 (32.6{\%}) and 21 (4.8{\%}), respectively (p = 0.1065). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the incidence of pulmonary, thromboembolic, cardiac, and gastrointestinal complications. However, the incidence of infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection, and sepsis) was significantly higher in the operative group (p = 0.000875). The incidence of instrumentation failure and need for revision surgery was 4.35{\%} (40 of 919), a significant morbidity, and an event unique to the operative category (p = 0.00396). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited number of high-quality studies, conclusions related to complication rates of operative and nonoperative management of thoracolumbar traumatic injuries cannot be definitively made. Further prospective, randomized studies of operative versus nonoperative management of thoracolumbar and lumbar spine trauma, with standardized definitions of complications and matched patient cohorts, will aid in properly defining the risk-benefit ratio of surgery for thoracolumbar spine fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, a prospective, randomized study comparing operative and nonoperative treatment of a thoracolumbar burst fracture in patients without a neurological deficit has never been performed. Our hypothesis was that operative treatment would lead to superior long-term clinical outcomes. METHODS: From 1994 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients (thirty-two men and fifteen women) with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative (posterior or anterior arthrodesis and instrumentation) or nonoperative treatment (application of a body cast or orthosis). Radiographs and computed tomography scans were analyzed for sagittal alignment and canal compromise. All patients completed a questionnaire to assess any disability they may have had before the injury, and they indicated the degree of pain at the time of presentation with use of a visual analog scale. The average duration of follow-up was forty-four months (minimum, twenty-four months). After treatment, patients indicated the degree of pain with use of the visual analog scale and they completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry back-pain questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. RESULTS: In the operative group (twenty-four patients), the average fracture kyphosis was 10.1 degrees at the time of admission and 13 degrees at the final follow-up evaluation. The average canal compromise was 39{\%} on admission, and it improved to 22{\%} at the final follow-up examination. In the nonoperative group (twenty-three patients), the average kyphosis was 11.3 degrees at the time of admission and 13.8 degrees at the final follow-up examination after treatment. The average canal compromise was 34{\%} at the time of admission and improved to 19{\%} at the final follow-up examination. On the basis of the numbers available, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to return to work. The average pain scores at the time of the latest follow-up were similar for both groups. The preinjury scores were similar for both groups; however, at the time of the final follow-up, those who were treated nonoperatively reported less disability. Final scores on the SF-36 and Oswestry questionnaires were similar for the two groups, although certain trends favored those treated without surgery. Complications were more frequent in the operative group. CONCLUSION: We found that operative treatment of patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and normal findings on the neurological examination provided no major long-term advantage compared with nonoperative treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest, and immobilization with a brace once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilization of the fracture with screws, often with decompression, an operation to remove bone fragments which have intruded into the vertebral canal. OBJECTIVES: To compare operative with non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (May 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2005), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) available at http://cbm.imicams.ac.cn (January 1978 to April 2005). We also searched reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted authors where necessary. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing operative with non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Pooling of data was not carried out as only one small, poor quality trial was included. MAIN RESULTS: We included one trial comparing operative with non-operative treatment (53 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in pain and function-related outcomes, rates of return to work, radiographic findings or average length of hospitalization at final follow up. The rate of complications was higher for the patients treated operatively. The degree of kyphosis or the percentage of correction lost did not correlate with any clinical symptoms at the time of the final follow up. Average costs related to hospitalization and treatment in the operative group appeared to be more than in the non-operative group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference on the functional outcome two years or more after therapy between operative and non-operative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. However, this review was able to include only one randomized controlled trial with a small sample size and poor quality, which precluded firm conclusions. More research with high quality trials is needed.},

A total of 50 patients were enrolled in a prospective study and assigned to one of two groups. After the exclusion of three patients, there were 23 patients in the fusion group and 24 in the non-fusion group. Follow-up was at a mean of 23.9 months (18 to 30). Functional outcome was evaluated using the Greenough Low Back Outcome Score. Neurological function was graded using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale. Radiological outcome was assessed on the basis of the angle of kyphosis. Peri-operative blood transfusion requirements and duration of surgery were significantly higher in the fusion group (p = 0.029 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). There were no clinical or radiological differences in outcome between the groups (all outcomes p {\textgreater} 0.05).

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and long-term stability of small fenestration vertebral bone grafting and transpedicular bone grafting in the treatment of Denis types A and B thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods: Between January 2012 and February 2014, 50 patients with Denis type A or B thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with vertebroplasty and pedicle screw rod fixation system, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Small fenestration vertebral bone grafting by trans-interlaminar approach was used in 30 cases (group A), and bone grafting by unilateral transpedicular approach was used in 20 cases (group B). X-ray and CT examinations of the thoracolumbar vertebrae were performed routinely before and after operation. There was no significant difference in sex, age, cause of injury, time from injury to operation, fracture type, injury segment, and preoperative Frankel classification, the percentage of the anterior body height of the injured vertebra, and visual analogue scale (VAS) score between two groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05). There was significant difference in preoperative Cobb angle of kyphosis between two groups ( P{\textless}0.05). The Cobb angle of kyphosis, the percentage of the anterior body height of the injured vertebra, and the recovery of neurological function were recorded and compared between two groups. Results: The patients were followed up for 16-31 months (mean, 19.1 months) in group A and for 17-25 months (mean, 20.2 months) in group B. Primary healing of incisions was obtained in the two groups; no nerve injury and other operative complications occurred. The neurological function was improved in varying degrees in the other patients with neurological impairment before operation except patients at grade A of Frankel classification. The lumbar back pain was relieved in two groups. There was significant difference in VAS score between before operation and at 3 months after operation or last follow-up in two groups ( P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found between at 3 months and last follow-up in two groups and between two groups at each time point after operation ( P{\textgreater}0.05). X-ray examination showed that there was no breakage of nail and bar, or dislocation and loosening of internal fixation during follow-up period. The bone grafts filled well and fused in the fractured vertebra. The vertebral height recovered well after operation. The percentage of the anterior body height of the in-jured vertebra and Cobb angle of kyphosis at 1 week, 3 months, and last follow-up were significantly better than preope-rative ones in two groups ( P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference between different time points after operation ( P{\textgreater}0.05), and between two groups at each time point after operation ( P{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: For Denis types A and B thoracolumbar burst fractures, vertebral bone grafting and pedicle screw internal fixation through interlaminal small fene-stration or transpedicular approach can restore the vertebral height, correct kyphosis, and maintain the vertebral stability, which reduce the risk of complications of loosening and breakage of internal fixators. The appropriate bone grafting approach can be chosen based on the degree of spinal canal space occupying, collapse of vertebral and spinal cord injury.},

abstract = {OBJECT: To investigate what benefits can be derived from a shorter construct length in the pedicle screw based surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture (TLBF). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of clinical notes and radiology for patients who underwent surgical fixation of TLBFs between 2007 and 2012 in a single UK institution. Constructs either fixed the vertebra above the fracture to the vertebra below (short segment fixation - SSF) or fixed the vertebra above to the relatively well-preserved pedicles and inferolateral portions of the bodies of the fractured vertebra (mono-segment fixation - MSF). 11 patients in each group were included and length of operation, postoperative opiate use, time to mobilisation and length of hospital stay were recorded. Anterior vertebral height loss (AVHL) was measured from sagittal reconstructions of CT imaging and lateral radiographs. RESULTS: The mean operation time was 169 +/- 10.4 min in the MSF group compared to 227 +/- 13.3 minin the SSF group (p = 0.0028). Mean postoperative opiate use was 50.4 +/- 17.9 mg in the MSF group compared to 126.6 +/- 64.6 mgs in the SSF group (p = 0.3088, ns). Mean time to mobilisation was 1.3 +/- 0.2 in the MSF group and 3.4 +/- 1.3 in the SSF group (p = 0.1031, ns). There were no significant differences in progression of anterior vertebral height loss or hospital stay between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: MSF for TLBFs is associated with shorter operative times than SSF. Strong trends are also demonstrated to quicker mobilisation, and lower opiate use. These advantages of a shorter construct length may result in cost saving and echo the advantages claimed by others for reducing spinal exposure in minimally invasive spinal surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A loss of reduction due to inadequate support of the anterior column  when using short-segment instrumentation to treat burst fracture and novel methods for support of the anterior column through a posterior approach to augment posterior instrumentation have been reported in the literature. We hypothesized that if anterior column support is an important adjunct to posterior short-segment instrumentation, then avoidance of axial load until sufficient anterior column healing occurs, allowing load-sharing with the implant, would improve spinal alignment at follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which consecutive patients who had instrumentation and fusion with the AO spinal fixator were immediately ambulated after surgery or had 4 weeks of bedrest. We measured kyphosis and wedge angles preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and at the time of final follow-up. We used radiologic measures to assess instrumentation and bone failure. RESULTS: We found significant differences in the mean loss of wedge and kyphosis angle correction between patients immediately ambulated and those who had 4 weeks of bedrest (0.71 masculine v. - 4.73 masculine for wedge and 1.81 masculine v. - 6.55 masculine for kyphosis, respectively). There was significant correlation between instrumentation and bone failure in both the immediate ambulation and bedrest groups. CONCLUSION: Bedrest improves the maintenance of intraoperative sagittal alignment correction, which is in agreement with the theory that inadequate support of the anterior spinal column is the mechanism for loss of reduction when using short-segment instrumentation to treat burst fractures. Therefore, addressing the anterior column directly through anterior surgery or by employing novel techniques in posterior surgery is recommended if one of the goals of treatment is to maintain the sagittal correction achieved at the time of surgery. Trying to achieve this goal by addressing posterior implant design or bone quality alone will not be successful because instrumentation and bone failure occur together.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis (CUA). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of pedicle screw removal after posterior fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screw instrumentation is a standard fixation method for unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture. However, removal of the pedicle screw after successful fusion remains controversial because the clinical benefits remain unclear. CUA can help clinicians make appropriate decisions about optimal health care for pedicle screw removal after successful fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, longitudinal matched-cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes. In total, 88 consecutive patients who had undergone pedicle screw instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fracture with successful fusion confirmed by computed tomography (CT) were used in this study. In total, 45 patients wanted to undergo implant removal surgery (R group), and 43 decided not to remove the implant (NR group). A CUA was conducted from the health care perspective. The direct costs of health care were obtained from the medical bill of each patient. Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores, validated by Short Form 6D, were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Total costs and gained QALY were calculated at 1 year (1 year) and 2 years (2 years) compared with baseline. Results are expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Different discount rates (0{\%}, 3{\%}, and 5{\%}) were applied to both cost and QALY for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Baseline patient variables were similar between the two groups (all P {\textgreater} 0.05). The additional benefits of implant removal (0.201 QALY at 2 years) were achieved with additional costs ({\$}2541 at 2 years), equating to an ICER of {\$}12,641/QALY. On the basis of the different discount rates, the robustness of our study's results was also determined. CONCLUSION: Implant removal after successful fusion in a thoracolumbar burst fracture is cost-effective until postoperative year 2. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The anatomy and biomechanics of the thoracolumbar spine place these segments at high risk of trauma injuries. Treatment options are either conservative or surgical, and there is a lack of consensus about the right indications. International scientific publications agree only on basic surgical principles: vertebral stability, deformity correction, protection of neurological structures and fast functional recovery. The most commonly used approach is the posterior approach, which allows the best management of most vertebral fracture patterns. The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of monosegmental stabilisation with those of bisegmental stabilisation and fusion in the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective clinical and radiological study evaluated 48 consecutive patients treated with monosegmental (Group M; n=14) or bisegmental (Group B; n=34) posterior pedicular instrumentation for thoracolumbar fractures. Fractures were classified by the new AO Spine TLIC system. Average follow-up was 30 months. Clinical outcomes in both groups were statistically compared. Radiological outcomes were evaluated in terms of vertebral anterior body height restoration and correction of the kyphotic deformity. RESULTS: Radiographical results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in vertebral body height restoration and correction of the kyphotic deformity. The mean postoperative somatic vertebral anterior body height in Group M was 25.8+/-4.52mm and in Group B it was 24.43+/-4.27mm. In Group M the mean postoperative kyphotic deformity was 11.10+/-5.71 degrees , in Group B it was 9.09+/-4.93 degrees . CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the validity of short and very short instrumentation for the treatment of well-selected type A and B vertebral fractures. In C type fractures correct surgical indication must be evaluated on an individual basis.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The management of amyelic thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). Twenty-three patients were treated with PKP, and 25 patients with SSPI. They all presented with Type A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at two years follow-up. Radiographic data including the anterior and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle, as well as spinal canal compromise was also evaluated. The patients in both groups were similar regarding age, bone mineral density (BMD), follow-up period, severity of the deformity and fracture. Blood loss, operation time, and bed-rest time were less in the PKP group. VAS, ODI score improved more rapidly after surgery in the PKP group. No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at final follow-up (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Meanwhile, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha), the height of posterior vertebrae (Hp) and the kyphosis angle showed significant improvement in each group (p {\textless} 0.05). The postoperative improvement in spinal canal compromise was not statistically significant in the PKP group (p {\textgreater} 0.05); there was a significant improvement in the SSPI group (p {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, these postoperative radiographic assessments showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the improvement of canal compromise (p {\textless} 0.05). At final follow-up, remodeling of spinal canal compromise was detected in both groups. CONCLUSION: Both PKP and SSPI appeared as effective and reliable operative techniques for selected amyelic thoracolumbar fractures in the short-term. PKP had a significantly smaller blood loss and shorter bed-rest time, but SSPI provided a better reduction. Long-time studies should be conducted to support these clinical outcomes.},

METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and other databases using the search terms "thoracolumbar fractures", "anterior", "posterior", "controlled clinical trials". Relevant journals or conference proceedings were also searched manually. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the trials that met the selection criteria. Sensitivity analysis was performed when there was significant heterogeneity. Results were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95 {\%} confidence interval. RESULTS: Four randomized clinical trials and three controlled clinical trials comparing the results of the anterior versus posterior approach in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrieved; these studies included 179 and 152 patients in the anterior and posterior approach groups, respectively. There were no differences in terms of neurological recovery, return to work, complications and Cobb angle between the two groups. The anterior approach was associated with longer operative time, greater blood loss and higher cost than the posterior approach. CONCLUSIONS: The posterior approach may be more effective than the anterior approach. However, more high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to compare these approaches and guide clinical decision-making. Level of Evidence Level II, therapeutic study.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical therapeutic outcomes for severe burst fracture of lumbar vertebrae via a posterior approach for one-stage spinal "three-column" reconstruction. METHODS: An retrospective analysis of data was performed for 21 patients with severe burst fracture of lumbar vertebrae undergoing a posterior approach for one-stage spinal "three-column" reconstruction from 2005 to 2010. It was compared with previous 15 cases undergoing a staged anteroposterior approach. The operative duration, volume of blood loss, pre- and post-operative imaging measurements of kyphosis and vertebral height and nerve function recovery were evaluated. RESULTS: The values of operative duration and volume of blood loss in the one-stage posterior approach group were significantly less than those of the two-stage anteroposterior approach group [(263 +/- 72) min vs (439 +/- 75) min, t = -5.303, P {\textless} 0.01; (1143 +/- 296) ml vs (1471 +/- 399) ml, t = -2.169, P = 0.042)]. Statistical significance existed in postoperative kyphosis between two groups [(0.5 +/- 2.0) degrees vs (3.9 +/- 2.6) degrees , t = -3.336, P = 0.003]. Vertebral height had no statistical significance pre- and post-operatively between two groups while restoration of vertebral height did [(0.47 +/- 0.19) mm vs (0.26 +/- 0.15) mm, t = 2.669, P = 0.015]. CONCLUSION: Posterior approach for one-stage vertebral resection, mesh implantation, pedicle screws and rod internal fixation for reconstructing spinal "three-column" structures offers excellent feasibility and safety. And it may avoid complications associated with an anteroposterior approach for two-stage procedures. The median length of hospital stay is also reduced.},

Ninety-two patients were included in this study. The patients fell into 1 of 3 groups: those who received H-grafts (n=36), posterior vertebral grafts (n=30), and no graft (n=26). Mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 24-51 months). All operations were performed by a single senior surgeon. All patients underwent operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation. Radiographic parameters, estimated blood loss, operative time, and length of hospital stay were compared among patients in the 3 graft groups. Differences were assessed using unpaired t tests. P values {\textless}.05 were considered significant. We found no significant difference among groups in age, fracture location, or type of fracture. Patients who received H-grafts or posterior vertebral grafts achieved solid fusion, but spontaneous fusion occurred in only 2 patients who received no bone graft. Most patients with neurological deficits showed significant neurological improvement. Operative time and estimated blood loss were significantly lower in the no-graft group than in the H-graft and posterior vertebral graft groups (P{\textless}.05). Mean loss of correction, operative time, and estimated blood loss were lower for patients who received H-grafts than for those who received posterior vertebral grafts (P{\textless}.05). The use of an atlas fixation system in combination with a posterior H-graft for the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture is a stable and reliable method that effectively prevents inner fixation failure and reduces bone loss and anisotropy.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the imaging features that can be used to predict failure of reduction of a retropulsed fracture fragment by posterior ligamentotaxis in thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Posterior instrumentation and distraction with ligamentotaxis has been successfully used to shift retropulsed fragments anteriorly in thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, posterior longitudinal ligament rupture can lead to treatment failure. The exact preoperative radiographical parameters associated with failure of reduction remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 85 patients who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fractures with significant retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal, as confirmed by preoperative computed tomography and followed by postoperative computed tomography, were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-three patients (85.9{\%}) in whom the fragments were reduced by ligamentotaxis were included in the reduced group. In 12 patients (14.1{\%}), the fracture fragment in the spinal canal was not reduced, and these patients were included in the nonreduced group. Neurologic status was classified according to the scoring system of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). The displaced distance and rotation angle of the fracture fragment were measured at the fractured segment. RESULTS: Preoperatively,the average displacement distances into the spinal canal of rotated posterosuperior fragments was 0.53 cm in the reduced group and 0.94 cm in the nonreduced group (P=0.002). The average rotation angles of the fracture fragments were 43.2 degrees in the reduced group and 61.7 degrees in the nonreduced group (P=0.012). "Double cortical surfaces" of the fragment were observed in the nonreduced patients. Neurological function was evaluated and recorded at the 2-year follow-up examination. There was no significant difference in the ASIA recovery grade between the 2 groups (P=0.668). CONCLUSIONS: Displaced and rotated posterosuperior fracture fragments in thoracolumbar burst fracture cannot always be reduced by posterior ligamentotaxis. The 2 criteria for treatment failure that were most consistently present in our series were a displacement distance greater than 0.85 cm and a rotation angle greater than 55 degrees.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Thoracolumbar fractures account for 90{\%} of spinal fractures, with the burst subtype corresponding to 20{\%} of this total. Controversy regarding the best treatment for this condition remains. The traditional surgical approach, when indicated, involves spinal fixation and arthrodesis. Newer studies have brought the need for fusion associated with internal fixation into question. Not performing arthrodesis could reduce surgical time and intraoperative bleeding without affecting clinical and radiological outcomes. With this study, the authors aimed to assess the effect of fusion, adjuvant to internal fixation, on surgically treated thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS A search of the Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed to identify randomized trials that compared the use and nonuse of arthrodesis in association with internal fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The search encompassed all data in these databases up to February 28, 2016. RESULTS Five randomized/quasi-randomized trials, which involved a total of 220 patients and an average follow-up time of 69.1 months, were included in this review. No significant difference between groups in the final scores of the visual analog pain scale or Low Back Outcome Scale was detected. Surgical time and blood loss were significantly lower in the group of patients who did not undergo fusion (p {\textless} 0.05). Among the evaluated radiological outcomes, greater mobility in the affected segment was found in the group of those who did not undergo fusion. No significant difference between groups in the degree of kyphosis correction, loss of kyphosis correction, or final angle of kyphosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS The data reviewed in this study suggest that the use of arthrodesis did not improve clinical outcomes, but it was associated with increased surgical time and higher intraoperative bleeding and did not promote significant improvement in radiological parameters.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The load-sharing score (LSS) of vertebral body comminution is predictive  of results after short-segment posterior instrumentation of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Some authors have posited that an LSS {\textgreater} 6 is predictive of neurological injury, ligamentous injury, and the need for surgical intervention. However, the authors of the present study hypothesized that the LSS does not predict ligamentous or neurological injury. METHODS: The prospectively collected spinal cord injury database from a single institution was queried for thoracolumbar burst fractures. Study inclusion criteria were acute ({\textless} 24 hours) burst fractures between T-10 and L-2 with preoperative CT and MRI. Flexion-distraction injuries and pathological fractures were excluded. Four experienced spine surgeons determined the LSS and posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) integrity. Neurological status was assessed from a review of the medical records. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included in the study. There were 4 patients for whom all observers assigned an LSS {\textgreater} 6, recommending operative treatment. Eleven patients had LSSs {\textless}/= 6 across all observers, suggesting that nonoperative treatment would be appropriate. There was moderate interobserver agreement (0.43) for the overall LSS and fair agreement (0.24) for an LSS {\textgreater} 6. Correlations between the LSS and the PLC score averaged 0.18 across all observers (range -0.02 to 0.34, p value range 0.02-0.89). Correlations between the LSS and the American Spinal Injury Association motor score averaged -0.12 across all observers (range -0.25 to -0.03, p value range 0.1-0.87). Correlations describing the relationship between an LSS {\textgreater} 6 and the treating physician's decision to operate averaged 0.17 across all observers (range 0.11-0.24, p value range 0.12-0.47). CONCLUSIONS: The LSS does not uniformly correlate with the PLC injury, neurological status, or empirical clinical decision making. The LSSs of only one observer correlated significantly with PLC injury. There were no significant correlations between the LSS as determined by any observer and neurological status or clinical decision making.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective clinical and radiographic study was performed. OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 grafting materials of anterior augmentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures: transpedicular cancellous bone (TPCB) grafting and transpedicular calcium sulfate grafting and to decide whether calcium sulfate cement can replace autogenous cancellous bone applied in anterior vertebral body augmentation after posterior short-segment instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Additional TPCB grafting was developed as an alternative to prevent early implant failure. However, the results are inconsistent and donor-site complications are a major concern. Calcium sulfate has been offered as a bone substitute for treating patients with metaphysis fractures or bone defect, but the results of application in spinal surgeries are uncertain. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with a single-level thoracolumbar burst fracture for treatment with short-segment pedicle screw fixation were enrolled in the study. Fractures in group 1 patients were reinforced with TPCB (n = 31), and fractures in group 2 patients were augmented with transpedicular calcium sulfate cement (TPCSC; n = 20). All patients were followed-up at least 2 years after surgery. Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, fracture levels, preoperative neurologic status distribution, and the associated injuries. The TPCB group had a longer period of follow-up (52.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 28.6 +/- 3.5 months, P {\textless} 0.001). Blood loss and operation time were less in the TPCSC group (247.5 +/- 164.2 vs. 600.0 +/- 403.1 mL, P = 0.001 and 161.7 +/- 28.5 vs. 227.2 +/- 43.6 minutes, P {\textless} 0.001). Radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. The TPCSC group had no surgical complication, but the TPCB group revealed 2 cases with wound infection after surgery. The failure rate, defined as an increase of 10 degrees or more in loss of correction or implant failure, was also not significantly different (TPCB = 9.6{\%} and TPCSC = 15{\%}; P = 0.565). All patients with partial neurologic deficits initially improved at the final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Additional TPCB grafting after posterior short-segment instrumentation remains a reliable surgical method for correcting and maintaining sagittal alignment and vertebral body height in thoracolumbar burst fractures. Calcium sulfate cement also proved to be an effective bone substitute used in spinal surgeries for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effect of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior lateral fusion (PLF) in treatment of thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation. METHODS: From January 2005 to July 2007, 35 patients (22 males, 13 females, aged 17-53 years old) with thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation (T11-L3) received posterior open reduction and pedicle nail-stick system internal fixation. Among which, 14 patients underwent TLIF (group TLIF), and the rest 21 patients underwent PLF (group PLF). According to AO classification, group TLIF had 3 cases of A3, 7 cases of B and 4 cases of C, while group PLF had 4 cases of A3, 10 cases of B and 7 cases of C. Based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scoring Standard formulated in 2000, the motor score of group TLIF and group PLF was (50.6 +/- 3.6) and (50.8 +/- 4.2) points, respectively; and the sensory score was (170.5 +/- 42.7) and (153.8 +/- 23.7) points, respectively. No significant difference was noted between 2 groups in general information (P {\textgreater} 0.05). RESULTS: The operation time of group TLIF and group PLF was (316 +/- 32) minutes and (254 +/- 27) minutes, and the blood loss of group TLIF and group PLF was (487 +/- 184) mL and (373 +/- 72) mL, indicating there were significant differences between 2 groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Wounds of all patients were healed by first intention and there was no death, aggravation of neurological function impairment and complication of internal fixation instrument loosening and breaking. All 35 cases were followed up for 9-23 months with an average of 14.6 months. Postoperatively, the thoracolumbar bone fusion rate of group TLIF and group PLF was 100{\%} and 85.7{\%}, respectively, indicating there was a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.05). At 3 months after operation, the motor score of group TLIF and group PLF was increased by (10.4 +/- 10.0) and (9.4 +/- 9.3) points, respectively; and the sensory score was upgraded by (26.5 +/- 22.8) and (28.8 +/- 28.4) points, respectively, showing there were no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At immediate moment, 3, 6 and 12 months after operation, the spine height restoration of group TLIF was (5.4 +/- 2.1), (5.4 +/- 1.9), (5.4 +/- 1.4) and (5.3 +/- 1.3) mm, respectively; while it was (5.3 +/- 2.6), (5.3 +/- 2.2), (4.8 +/- 3.1) and (4.2 +/- 3.6) mm for group PLF. Meanwhile, the Cobb angle recovery of group TLIF was (14.5 +/- 3.5), (14.5 +/- 3.6), (14.4 +/- 3.4) and (14.4 +/- 3.6) degrees, respectively; while it was (14.3 +/- 2.7), (14.2 +/- 3.1), (12.2 +/- 2.8) and (11.7 +/- 3.3) degrees for group PLF. Concerning the spine height restoration and the Cobb angle recovery, no significant difference was observed between 2 groups at immediate moment and 3 months after operation (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but significant differences were noted at 6 and 12 months after operation (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: For the treatment of thoracolumbar spine fracture and dislocation, TLIF is superior to PLF in bony fusion and restoration of spine column height.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The thoracolumbar AO type A3 fracture is an incomplete burst fracture, which affects one vertebral body endplate. The objective of this study was to determine which of two minimal invasive techniques was more suitable for A3 fractures based on clinical and radiographic results. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 112 patients with A3 subtype fractures without neurological deficits. A total of 63 patients received percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF), and 49 patients were treated using mini-open Wiltse approach with pedicle screw fixation (MWPSF). The clinical outcomes, surgery-related results, and the pre-operative and post-operative radiological findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The length of incision, intra-operative blood loss, post-operative hospitalization time, visual analog score (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and accuracy rate of pedicle screw placement were compared between the PPSF and MWPSF groups, with no significant differences found (p{\textgreater}0.05). However, the vertebral body angle (VBA) and Cobb's angle in the MWPSF group was much better than in the PPSF group (p{\textless}0.05). The operating time and C-arm exposure time of the MWPSF group were significantly lower than the PPSF group (p{\textless}0.05). The operative and post-operative costs of the PPSF group were significantly higher than the MWPSF group (p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study found no significant differences in some clinical outcomes between the two groups. Both treatments were safe and effective for A3 subtype fractures. Nevertheless, given the radiation exposure, reduction of kyphosis, special equipment required, learning curve and hospitalization costs associated with PPSF, we concluded that MWPSF was a better choice for A3 subtype fractures.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the results of short-segment pedicle instrumentation with screw insertion in the fracture level and find factors predicting kyphosis recurrence in thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 122 patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture who were divided into two groups: kyphosis recurrence and no kyphosis recurrence. Pre-operative radiographic data comprising Cobb angle (CA), regional angle, anterior vertebra height (AVH), upper intervertebral angle, vertebral wedge angle (VWA), pre-anteroposterior A/P approach, superior endplate fracture, load-sharing classification (LSC) score and clinical data including age, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score were compared between groups. T test, Pearson's chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were calculated for variables. RESULTS: CA, VWA and AVH were significantly corrected after surgery. CA changed from 23.7 to 3.0 (p {\textless}0.001), VWA from 38.7 to 9.6 (p {\textless}0.001) and AVH from 48.8 {\%} to 91.2 {\%} (p {\textless}0.001). These parameters were well maintained during the follow-up period with a mild, tolerant loss of correction. Neurological function and pain were significantly improved without deterioration. Age, pre-A/P and pre-AVH {\textless} 50 {\%} influenced kyphosis recurrence (p = 0.032, 0.026, 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment pedicle instrumentation including the fractured vertebra was effective in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. The loss of correction at follow-up after implant removal was associated with age, A/P ratio and anterior vertebral height {\textless} 50 {\%}.},

Patients with age of 16-60 years, complete radiographs, early surgical treatment surgery, and follow-up (F/U) {\textgreater} 18 months were included and strict exclusion criteria applied. Regional and thoracolumbar kyphosis angles (RKA and TLA) were measured preoperatively and at final F/U, as were parameters of the spinopelvic sagittal alignment.

Results. 36 patients with age mean age of 39 years and F/U of 69 months were included. 61{\%} of patients were treated with bisegmental posterior instrumentation (POST-I) and 39{\%} with combined posteroanterior instrumented fusion (PA-F). At F/U, several indicators for clinical outcomes showed a significant correlation with radiographic measures in the overall cohort with inferior clinical outcomes corresponding with increasing residual deformity and sagittal malalignment. Statistical analysis failed to reach level of significance for the differences between POST-I and PA-F group at final F/U. Only a strong trend towards better restoration of the thoracolumbar alignment was observed for the PA-F group in terms of the RKA and TLA. Conclusions. Results in a surgically treated cohort of T12 and L1 burst fracture patients indicate that superior clinical outcomes depend on restoration of sagittal alignment.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures is controversial. Most authors reported that short segment fixation led to a high incidence of implant failure and correction loss. On the other hand, long segment fixation has the disadvantage of fusing more segments. We aimed to compare the outcomes of long-segment fixation versus two or three levels above and one level below fixation for acute thoracolumbar fractures. Twenty six consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 14 patients treated with long fixation, whereas group 2 included 12 patients treated with two or three levels above and one level below fixation. Fractures were classified according to the Mc Cormack, Magerl and Denis classifications. Clinical (Oswestry questionnaire, Visual analog score) and radiological (Sagittal index, percentage of anterior body height compression, local kyphosis and Cobb angle) outcomes were analysed. The average follow-up for the long and hybrid fixation groups were 28 and 20 months respectively. Clinical scores of both groups at the last follow-up were not significantly different. The preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, anterior body height compression, local kyphosis angle and Cobb angle were not significantly different. Correction loss of 3.36 degrees was seen in the long segment fixation group, versus 2.75 degrees in the other group at the last follow-up. There was no significant difference between the results achieved in the patients who had transpedicular fixation two or three levels above and one level below the fractured vertebra and those who had long segment fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {METHODS: In this study of patients who underwent internal fixation without fusion for a burst thoracolumbar or lumbar fracture, we compared the serial changes in the injured disc height (DH), and the fractured vertebral body height (VBH) and kyphotic angle between patients in whom the implants were removed and those in whom they were not. Radiological parameters such as injured DH, fractured VBH and kyphotic angle were measured. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough low back outcome scale and a VAS scale for pain. RESULTS: Between June 1996 and May 2012, 69 patients were analysed retrospectively; 47 were included in the implant removal group and 22 in the implant retention group. After a mean follow-up of 66 months (48 to 107), eight patients (36.3{\%}) in the implant retention group had screw breakage. There was no screw breakage in the implant removal group. All radiological and functional outcomes were similar between these two groups. Although solid union of the fractured vertebrae was achieved, the kyphotic angle and the anterior third of the injured DH changed significantly with time (p {\textless} 0.05). DISCUSSION: The radiological and functional outcomes of both implant removal and retention were similar. Although screw breakage may occur, the implants may not need to be removed. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Implant removal may not be needed for patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine after fixation without fusion. However, information should be provided beforehand regarding the possibility of screw breakage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spite of the established benefits of anterolateral decompression and instrumentation (ALDI) for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF), the indications for supplementary posterior instrumentation remain unclear. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical and radiographic data of a prospective cohort of 73 patients who underwent ALDI for TLBF from T12 to L4. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 42 +/- 15 years, with 49 males and 24 females. Forty-six patients had neurological deficit, and 27 were intact. Owing to symptomatic settling, supplemental posterior instrumentation was performed in 7 out of 73 patients. The age of patients requiring supplemental posterior instrumentation (59 +/- 14 years) exceeded that of patients who did not (41 +/- 16, p=0.004). Otherwise, the patients who required posterior instrumentation were comparable to those treated with ALDI in terms of body mass index (BMI), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores on admission and follow-up, residual spinal canal, and local kyphosis on admission and follow-up. The posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) integrity was assessed in 38 patients in whom the MRI scans were retrievable, 31 successfully treated with ALDI, and all 7 undergoing supplementary posterior instrumentation. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in the incidence of PLC disruption between the 2 groups (p=0.257). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary supplemental posterior instrumentation was deemed necessary in 10{\%} of cases following ALDI. Age was the only significant risk factor predicating supplemental posterior instrumentation.},

abstract = {The second, internet-based multicenter study (MCSII) of the Spine Study Group of  the German Association of Trauma Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Unfallchirurgie) is a representative patient collection of acute traumatic thoracolumbar (T1-L5) injuries. The MCSII results are an update of those obtained with the first multicenter study (MCSI) more than a decade ago. The aim of the study was to assess and bring into focus: the (1) epidemiologic data, (2) surgical and radiological outcome, and (3) 2-year follow-up (FU) results of these injuries. According to the Magerl/AO classification, there were 424 (57.8{\%}) compression fractures (A type), 178 (24.3{\%}) distractions injuries (B type), and 131 (17.9{\%}) rotational injuries (C type). B and C type injuries carried a higher risk for neurological deficits, concomitant injuries, and multiple vertebral fractures. The level of injury was located at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) in 67.0{\%} of the case. 380 (51.8{\%}) patients were operated on by posterior stabilization and instrumentation alone (POSTERIOR), 34 (4.6{\%}) had an anterior procedure (ANTERIOR), and 319 (43.5{\%}) patients were treated with combined posteroanterior surgery (COMBINED). 65{\%} of patients with thoracic (T1-T10) and 57{\%} with lumbar spinal (L3-L5) injuries were treated with a single posterior approach (POSTERIOR). 47{\%} of the patients with thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2) injuries were either operated from posterior or with a combined posterior-anterior surgery (COMBINED) each. Short angular stable implant systems have replaced conventional non-angular stable instrumentation systems to a large extent. The posttraumatic deformity was restored best with COMBINED surgery. T-spine injuries were accompanied by a higher number and more severe neurologic deficits than TL junction or L-spine injuries. At the same time T-spine injuries showed less potential for neurologic recovery especially in paraplegic (Frankel/AISA A) patients. 5{\%} of all patients required revision surgery for perioperative complications. Follow-up data of 558 (76.1{\%}) patients were available and collected during a 30-month period from 1 January 2004 until 31 May 2006. On average, a posterior implant removal was carried out in a total of 382 COMBINED and POSTERIOR patients 12 months after the initial surgery. On average, the rehabilitation process required 3-4 weeks of inpatient treatment, followed by another 4 months of outpatient therapy and was significantly shorter when compared with MCSI in the mid-1990s. From the time of injury until FU, 80 (60.6{\%}) of 132 patients with initial neurological deficits improved at least one grade on the Frankel/ASIA Scale; 8 (1.3{\%}) patients deteriorated. A higher recovery rate was observed for incomplete neurological injuries (73{\%}) than complete neurological injuries (44{\%}). Different surgical approaches did not have a significant influence on the neurologic recovery until FU. Nevertheless, neurological deficits are the most important factors for the functional outcome and prognosis of TL spinal injuries. POSTERIOR patients had a better functional and subjective outcome at FU than COMBINED patients. However, the posttraumatic radiological deformity was best corrected in COMBINED patients and showed significantly less residual kyphotic deformity (biseg GDW -3.8 degrees COMBINED vs. -6.1 degrees POSTERIOR) at FU (p = 0.005). The sagittal spinal alignment was better maintained when using vertebral body replacement implants (cages) in comparison to iliac strut grafts. Additional anterior plate systems did not have a significant influence on the radiological FU results. In conclusion, comprehensive data of a large patient population with acute thoracolumbar spinal injuries has been obtained and analyzed with this prospective internet-based multicenter study. Thus, updated results and the clinical outcome of the current operative treatment strategies in participating German and Austrian trauma centers have been presented. Nevertheless, it was not possible to answer all remaining questions to contradictory findings of the subjective, clinical outcome and corresponding radiological findings between different surgical subgroups. Randomized-controlled long-term investigations seem mandatory and the next step in future clinical research of Spine Study Group of the German Trauma Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-segment U-shaped pedicle screw fixation has been widely used to treat thoracolumbar burst fracture. Some studies have reported the disadvantages of traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, which included a relatively high rate of adjacent segment degeneration and screw failure, including screw pullout and breakage. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of open reduction and fixation using KumaFix fixation system in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: From June 2011 to June 2012, 45 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with KumaFix (the treatment group, n = 23) or traditional U-shaped pedicle screw (the control group, n = 22). The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiologic and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb angle and vertebral wedge angle. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Questionnaire. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 9 to 22 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The operation time in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Preoperative Cobb angles and vertebral wedge angles in two groups were significantly decreased after surgery, and these have been well maintained at the last follow-up with mild correction losses. The results of clinical outcome showed lower VAS and ODI scores in two groups compared with those preoperative, and the treatment group had greater improvement on the ODI compared with the control group at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional U-shaped pedicle screw, KumaFix fixation system can achieve gradual, controlled reduction, provide enough space for bone implantation, and avoid acceleration of adjacent segment degeneration. It is an effective and reliable technique to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two different techniques of short-segment instrumentation, with and without a pedicle screw at the fracture level, were compared in thoracolumbar burst fractures in neurologically intact (ASIA-E) patients. The sagittal index, kyphosis angle (Cobb), canal compromise ratio, and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height were analyzed. METHODS: Seventy patients who underwent short-segment stabilization for thoracolumbar (T11-L2) burst fractures in our clinic between 2008 and 2012 were included in this retrospective study. In 35 patients (group 1), a pedicle screw was placed only one level down and one level up from the fracture level. In another 35 patients (group 2), a screw was placed at the fracture level in addition to the short segment. Only neurologically intact patients with burst fractures according to the Denis classification were included. The patients were evaluated according to their age/gender, trauma etiology, and fracture level. Their preoperative and most recent postoperative follow-up radiographs and CTs were evaluated in terms of the sagittal index, kyphosis angle (Cobb), ratio of canal compromise, and anterior vertebral height. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in their ages, follow-up periods, and severity of the deformity and fracture. When the pedicle screw was placed at the fracture level in addition to short-segment stabilization, statistically significant improvements in the sagittal index (p {\textless} 0.001), local kyphosis (Cobb) angle (p = 0.006), and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height (p = 0.002) were observed. Concerning the ratio of canal compromise according to the CT findings (p = 0.189), moderate differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment stabilization in thoracolumbar burst fractures with additional screws at the level of the fracture results in an improved kyphosis correction, sagittal index, and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral height. However, long-term follow-up is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of fracture level screw combination in achieving and maintaining correction in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Most authors reported that intraoperative correction of sagittal deformity is important for the maintenance of fracture reduction and is one of the most consistent predictor of satisfactory functional outcome. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures were randomized into 4 groups with equal number of patients. In group 1, patients were treated by segmental posterior instrumentation with 2 levels above and 2 levels below the fracture level fixation, in group 2 they were treated as in group 1 with fracture level screw incorporation. In group 3, patients were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation with 1 level above and 1 level below, in group 4 they were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation with fracture level screw incorporation. Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and at follow-up. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 50 months. Fracture level screw combination provided better intraoperative correction and maintenance in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures, which was more prevalent in short-segment fixation group. CONCLUSIONS: Reinforcement with fracture level screw combination can help to provide better kyphosis correction and offers immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effects of indirect decompression versus open  decompression to vertebral canal in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit. METHODS: From April 2004 to June 2008, 52 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit underwent posterior exposition, reduction and fixation with Atlas Fixator (AF) instrumentation. There were 34 males and 18 females with an average age of 43.1 years (range, 31-63 years). The affected locations were T11 in 5 cases, T12 in 24 cases, L1 in 16 cases, and L2 in 7 cases. The time from injury to operation was 3-8 days (4.4 days on average). All cases were divided into indirect decompression group (group A) and open decompression group (group B). There were no statistically significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in sex, age, affect site, and disease course between two groups. The operative time, blood loss were recorded. Preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and at last follow-up, the height of the fracture vertebra and the Cobb angle were obtained from X-ray pictures and were statistically analysed. Radiographic parameters on computed tomography (CT) pictures were used to get the encroachment rate of vertebral canal. RESULTS: The operative time was (87.3 +/-7.9) minutes and (125.3 +/- 13.6) minutes, and the blood loss was (273.7 +/- 23.4) mL and (512.6 +/- 37.7) mL in groups A and B, respectively; showing statistically significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05). The average follow-up time was 17.4 months (range, 11-31 months) in group A and 19.9 months (range, 12-33 months) in group B. All wounds achieved primary healing postoperatively without deaths and spinal cord injuries. Postoperative complications in group B included 3 cases of screws loosening, 1 case of screw breakage, and 3 cases of low back pain, and were given symptomatic management. There were no statistically significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in the height of the fracture vertebra, the Cobb angle and the encroachment rate of vertebral canal preoperatively or postoperatively between two groups. There were statistically significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) in the above three parameters between preoperation and postoperation in two groups, but there were no statistically significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in the spinal correction between two groups. The losing-rate of spinal correction of the height of the fracture vertebra and the Cobb angle of group A was lower than group B, showing statistically significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The short-term results of two decompression styles in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit were satisfactory, but indirect decompression has more merits than open decompression: shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower losing-rate of spinal correction, and better stabilization of vertebral column.},

METHODS: Between 2005 and 2009, two groups of 25 patients were analyzed to compare retrospectively surgical and conservative option of treatment to assess perception of pain and to evaluate quality of life during treatment, to evaluate how quickly patients return to work and to their daily activities, to evaluate patients' satisfaction. X-ray controls were performed to evaluate the fusion rate at 3 and 6 months and CT scans at 6 months. RESULTS: The surgical group had a better functional recovery, a better quality of life and returned to work earlier in comparison to the conservative group. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the percutaneous procedure seems to give better results in terms of satisfaction and return to normal activities, although both procedures guarantee excellent fusion rates.},

Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately. The objective of study was to perform a systematic review of the effectiveness of the anterior and posterior approaches in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. We conducted searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library, searching for relevant trials up to August 2013 that compared anterior and posterior for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The key words "anterior," "posterior," "thoracolumbar fracture," "CCT," and "RCT" were used. We assessed all included literature by using the Cochrane handbook (version 5.1). The results were expressed as the mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk difference for dichotomous outcomes, with a 95{\%} confidence interval, using RevMan version 5.2. There were 3 randomized controlled trials and 11 clinical controlled trials included. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between groups regarding Cobb angle, the Frankel scale, ASIA/JOA motor score, complications, and number of patients returning to work. Compared with the anterior approach, the posterior approach demonstrated superior canal decompression. In the burst fracture subgroup, operative times were significantly shorter and perioperative blood loss was less in the posterior approach group. The posterior approach is more effective for canal decompression, operative times, and perioperative blood loss. However, because of the lack of randomized controlled trials, and because of large sample size studies, heterogeneity was significant between reports. The optimal treatment for thoracolumbar fractures requires further study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcome of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws through paraspinal muscle sparing approach to treat thoracolumbar fractures, and to discuss its advantages. METHODS: From August 2010 to June 2012, we had 40 thoracolumber fractures patients (27 males and 13 females). Their ages ranged from 22 to 60 years. Of the 40 cases, 4 were T11 fractures, 13 T12 fractures ,17 L1 fractures,6 L2 fractures. According to Denis classification,all of them were burst fractures, with vertebral canal compromise less than 1/3. According to AO classification they were type A or type B1 injuries. All the cases had no nerve injury. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. With Group A (20 cases) we took the method of minimal invasive internal fixation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to fix one level above and below the injured vertebra through the parespinal muscle sparing approach. With Group B (20 cases), we took the traditional posterior midline approach and open procedure. Then we compared the two groups by operation time, blood loss, drainage, Visual Analogue Scales and X-ray exposure. RESULTS: Minimal invasive group had obvious advatages in operation time, bleeding control and early pain relief of post-operation. The X-ray exposure and long-term follow-up outcome were almost the same. CONCLUSION: Through paraspinal muscle sparing approach minimal invasive internal fixtation with U-shaped break-off pedicle screws to treat thoracolumber has more advantages than traditional procedure in blood control and quick recovery. The method needs no special instruments and don't increase X-ray exposure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fusion on short segment including fractured level (SSIFL) and long segment (LS) transpedicular fixation after acute thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. The 2-year clinical and radiologic follow-up results of the 2 groups also were compared. METHODS: Seventy-four patients were randomized into one of 2 groups: SSIFL (n = 39) or LS (n = 35). The SSIFL group included one level above and one level below, including the fracture level, whereas the LS group included 2 levels above and 2 levels below, excluding the fracture level, for the transpedicular fixation. Fusion was assessed by technetium 99m-methylendiphosphonate, bone scintigraphy, and single-photon emission computed tomography. The 2-year follow-up results were compared clinically (Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale) and radiologically (kyphosis angle, sagittal index, anterior vertebral body height loss) at regular intervals. The clinical scores and radiologic parameters of patients with and without fusion also were compared. RESULTS: The number of patients with fusion was significantly greater in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group. There was a significant reduction of the clinical scores of patients who had fusion compared with the fusion-free group; however, there was no radiologically significant difference. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the SSIFL and LS groups in terms of the 2-year radiologic and clinical follow-up results. CONCLUSIONS: Fusion occurred sooner and patients experienced earlier clinical recovery in the SSIFL group compared with the LS group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar burst fractures (TBFs) are often followed by bilateral  pedicle screw fixation (BPSF) at the level of fracture using posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). There has been increasing support for unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) in an attempt to reduce complications and costs. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic results of UPSF versus BPSF at the level of fracture using SSPI in the treatment of severe TBFs. METHODS: The records of 42 consecutive patients with severe TBFs who underwent SSPI were divided into 2 groups according to the number of screws in the fracture level, including 20 patients (five screws) in UPSF group and 22 patients (six screws) in BPSF. Different clinical and radiological parameters were recorded before surgery, after surgery, and 1.5 years after operation. The patients'clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). For radiological evaluation, changes in local kyphosis angle (LKA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH) were investigated using plain radiographs. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 18.3 months for UPSF group and 19.0 months for BPSF group (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no significant differences in the age, gender, fracture type and site in both groups. Radiologically, no statistically difference was observed between the two groups in corrected rate of LKA, VWA, or AVH(all P {\textgreater} 0.05). With respect to clinical variants including VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the UPSF group seemed to have advantages over BPSF group in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, hospitalization time (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Especially, implant cost for the BPSF group was 22{\%} greater than the UPSF group. No serious complications occurred in our study. In all cases, fusions healed well and no revision surgery was performed for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to demonstrate that patients undergoing SSPI with UPSF as compared with BPSF for the treatment of severe TBFs had similar clinical and radiologic outcomes.},

We conducted a controlled clinical trial to define the effect of fusion on lumbar spine and patient-related functional outcomes. METHODS: From 2000 to 2002, seventy-three consecutive patients with a single-level Denis type-B burst fracture involving the thoracolumbar spine and a load-sharing score of {\textless}or=6 were managed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with posterolateral fusion (fusion group, n = 37) or without posterolateral fusion (nonfusion group, n = 36). The patients were followed for at least five years after surgery and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with use of the Frankel scale, the motor score of the American Spinal Injury Association, a visual analog scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Radiographic outcomes were assessed on the basis of the local kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction. RESULTS: No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between the patients managed with the two techniques. Both operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the nonfusion group compared with the fusion group (p {\textless} 0.05). Twenty-five of the thirty-seven patients in the fusion group still had some degree of donor-site pain at the time of the latest examination. CONCLUSIONS: Posterolateral bone-grafting is not necessary when a Denis type-B thoracolumbar burst fracture associated with a load-sharing score of {\textless}or=6 is treated with short-segment pedicle screw fixation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since introduction of the pedicle screw-rod system, short-segment pedicle screw fixation has been widely adopted for thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBF). Recently, the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been introduced in spinal surgery; and it has become a popularly used method for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease. However, there are few clinical reports concerning the efficacy of PPSF without fusion in treatment of TLBF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of short-segment PPSF without fusion in comparison to open short-segment pedicle screw fixation with bony fusion in treatment of TLBF. METHODS: This study included 59 patients, who underwent either percutaneous (n = 32) or open (n = 27) short-segment pedicle screw fixation for stabilization of TLBF between December 2003 and October 2009. Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were assessed on a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph. For patient's pain and functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Frankel grading system, and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) were measured. Operation time, and the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss were also evaluated. FINDINGS: In both groups, regional kyphosis (Cobb angle) showed significant improvement immediately after surgery, which was maintained until the last follow up, compared with preoperative regional kyphosis. Postoperative correction loss showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. In the percutaneous surgery group, there were significant declines of intraoperative blood loss, and operation time compared with the open surgery group. Clinical results showed that the percutaneous surgery group had a lower VAS score and a better LBOS at three months and six months after surgery; however, the outcomes were similar in the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Both open and percutaneous short-segment pedicle fixation were safe and effective for treatment of TLBF. Although both groups showed favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes at the final follow-up, PPSF without bone graft provided earlier pain relief and functional improvement, compared with open TPSF with posterolateral bony fusion. Despite several shortcomings in this study, the result suggests that ongoing use of PPSF is recommended for the treatment of TLBF.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw (SSPI+IS) on the radiological outcome of type A thoracolumbar fractures, as judged by the load-sharing classification, percentage canal area reduction and remodelling. We retrospectively evaluated 39 patients who had undergone hyperlordotic SSPI+IS for an AO-Magerl Type-A thoracolumbar fracture. Their mean age was 35.1 (16 to 60) and the mean follow-up was 22.9 months (12 to 36). There were 26 men and 13 women in the study group. In total, 18 patients had a load-sharing classification score of seven and 21 a score of six. All radiographs and CT scans were evaluated for sagittal index, anterior body height compression ({\%}ABC), spinal canal area and encroachment. There were no significant differences between the low and high score groups with respect to age, duration of follow-up, pre-operative sagittal index or pre-operative anterior body height compression (p = 0.217, 0.104, 0.104, and 0.109 respectively). The mean pre-operative sagittal index was 19.6 degrees (12 degrees to 28 degrees ) which was corrected to -1.8 degrees (-5 degrees to 3 degrees ) post-operatively and 2.4 degrees (0 degrees to 8 degrees ) at final follow-up (p = 0.835 for sagittal deformity). No patient needed revision for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation. Hyperlordotic reduction and short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw is a safe and effective method of treating burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. It gives excellent radiological results with a very low rate of failure regardless of whether the fractures have a high or low load-sharing classification score.},

We conducted a clinical controlled trial to investigate the effect and outcomes of this technique in such patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients over 65 years old with thoracolumbar burst fractures without nerve injuries were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with simple PKP (control group, n = 22) or percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw internal fixation with PKP (treatment group, n = 21). The patients were followed for at least 2 years postoperatively and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The treatment group had better VAS scores and greater postoperative improvement on the ODI compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Postoperative kyphosis angle correction in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group, and loss of correction postoperatively was significantly less (P {\textless} 0.05). In the control group, two patients suffered refractures of the injured vertebra postoperatively and one had a fracture in the adjacent vertebra. No postoperative complications needing management were noted in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with simple PKP, percutaneous internal fixation with PKP is a valuable surgical option for the treatment of selected elderly patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was designed to answer 3 primary research questions: (1) What is the most useful classification system for surgical and nonsurgical decision-making with regard to thoracolumbar (TL) spine injuries? (2) For a TL burst fracture with incomplete neurologic deficit, what is the optimal surgical approach and stabilization technique? (3) Is complete disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex an indication for surgical intervention for TL burst fractures? SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite a long history of descriptive and clinical series, there remains considerable controversy and wide variation in the treatment of traumatic TL spine injuries. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the English literature was conducted using Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Standardized grading systems were used to assess the level of evidence and quality of articles impacting the research questions. RESULTS: Recommendations for the primary research questions were as follows: (1) Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System seems to be the best system available for therapeutic decision-making for TL spine injuries (strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low). (2) There is no specific surgical approach in the case of a TL burst fracture with incomplete neurologic deficit that has any advantage with regard to neurologic recovery (strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low). (3) Complete disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex as determined collectively by morphologic criteria using plain radiographs and computed tomography is an indication for surgical intervention in TL burst fractures (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). CONCLUSION: Based on this systematic review of the literature only very low to moderate quality studies could be identified to address clinical questions related to TL spine trauma. These findings suggest the need for further study, including emphasis on higher quality studies.},

OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and radiographic outcomes of minimal invasive surgery, and the rational of circumferential fracture treatment with regard to age, degenerative changes, bone mineral density, and global sagittal balance. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Non-neurologic fractures with anterior column defect can be treated by posterior percutaneous instrumentation and selective anterior fusion. After consolidation, instrumentation can be removed at 1 year to provide mobility in non-fused segments. METHODS: Fifty-one patients, 47 (18-75) years, were operated for A2, A3, or B-type fractures. Visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were assessed. Radiographic measurements were: sagittal index, regional kyphosis, T4-T12 kyphosis, L1-S1 lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, and T9 tilt. Anterior fusion and facet joints were analyzed on computed tomography (CT) at 1 year. RESULTS: The ODI was 8.8 before accident, 35.4 at 3 months, 17.8 at 2 years, 14.4 at 5 years. The VAS was 2.0 at 3 months and 1.0 at 5 years. The sagittal index was 18.0 degrees preoperatively and 1.0 degrees at 3 months (P {\textless} 0.0001). A loss of reduction of 1.1 degrees occurred after implant removal (P = 0.009). Global sagittal balance remained unchanged. Ten patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis had a worse ODI: 24.7 versus 11.9 (P = 0.016), and a greater loss of correction: 4.9 degrees versus 1.3 degrees (P = 0.007). Cages filled with cancellous bone from the fractured vertebra fused regularly. Spontaneous facet joint fusions were observed in two patients at the fracture level in B-type injuries. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous instrumentation and selective anterior fusion using autologous bone and mesh cages lead to high fusion rates, which provided good long-term clinical results in younger patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Sagittal alignment was maintained after instrumentation removal without damaging paravertebral muscles. Outcomes were worse in elderly patients presenting osteopenia or osteoporosis.

METHODS: Between June 2000 and June 2009, 126 cases of thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated by one-stage posterior short segment internal fixation combined with bone graft fusion. All patients had acute spine and spinal injury at the levels of T11-L2, who were with different degrees of neural function injury (below Frankel grade D). The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups and were treated respectively by centrum combined with interbody bone graft fusion (group A), posterolateral bone graft fusion (group B), and ring bone graft fusion (group C) combined with posterior short segment pedicle instrumentation. The changes of the Cobb angle, correction loss of Cobb angle, bone fusion rate, internal fixation failure rate, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Frankel grade of the fracture vertebral were observed after operation to evaluate the effectiveness of different bone graft fusion ways. RESULTS: All 126 cases were followed up 24-32 months (mean, 28 months). The operation time and bleeding volume in group C were significantly larger than those in groups A and B (P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and B (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At 2 years after operation and last follow-up, the Cobb angle and correction loss in group B were significantly larger than those in groups A and C (P {\textless} 0.05), but there was no significant difference between groups A and C (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At last follow-up, the bone fusion rate and internal fixation failure rate were 100{\%} and 0 in group A, 78.6{\%} and 21.4{\%} in group B, and 97.5{\%} and 0 in group C; there were significant differences between group B and groups A, C (P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and C (P {\textgreater} 0.05). ODI and Frankel grade were obviously improved after operation, showing significant differences between preoperation and last follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05) in 3 groups, between group B and groups A, C (P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant difference was found between groups A and C (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The centrum combined with interbody bone graft fusion is best in 3 bone graft fusion ways because of its optimum bone fusion and according with human body biomechanics mechanism. Back out board bone graft fusion may not a appropriate bone fusion way because of its high internal fixation failure rate and not according with human body biomechanics mechanism. The ring bone graft fusion may not be an indispensable bone fusion way because of its common bone fusion ratio and lower cost-performance ratio.},

abstract = {Burst fractures are common in the thoracolumbar junction and account for 17{\%} of all major spinal fractures. There is a considerable controversy on the efficacy of conservative treatment and the need for surgical intervention. Need for additional stability, prevention of neurological deterioration, attainment of canal clearance, prevention of kyphosis and early relief of pain are the commonly quoted reasons for surgical intervention. However, a careful review of literature does not validate any of the above arguments. The available randomised control trials prove that the results of conservative treatment for burst fractures are equal to that of surgery and also with lesser complications. Surgery for burst fractures may, however, have definite advantages in patients with polytrauma or in the rare event of deteriorating neurology. It is also important for the treating surgeon to clearly distinguish a burst fracture from other inherently unstable injuries like fracture dislocations, chance fractures and flexion rotation injuries which require surgical stabilisation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The surgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures frequently involves posterior pedicle screw fixation. However, the application of short- or long-segment instrumentation is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of the short-segment fixation with inclusion of the fracture level (SSFIFL) versus the traditional long-segment fixation (LSF) for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures. METHODS: From December 2009 to February 2014, 60 patients with unstable thoracolumbar junction fractures (T11-L2) were divided into two groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group 1 included 30 patients treated by SSFIFL (six-screw construct including the fracture level). Group 2 included 30 patients treated by LSF (eight-screw construct excluding the fracture level). Local kyphosis angle (LKA), anterior body height (ABH), posterior body height (PBH), ABH/PBH ratio of fractured vertebra, and Asia Scale Impairment Scale were evaluated. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in regard to age, sex, trauma etiology, fracture level, fracture type, neurologic status, pre-operative LKA, ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio and follow-up (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Reduction of post-traumatic kyphosis (assessed with LKA) and restoration of fracture-induced wedge shape of the vertebral body (assessed with ABH, PBH, and ABH/PBH ratio) at post-operative period were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.234; p = 0.754). There was no significant difference between the two groups in term of correction loss at the last follow-up too (LKA was 15.97 degrees +/- 5.62 degrees for SSFIFL and 17.76 degrees +/- 11.22 degrees for LSF [p = 0.427]). Neurological outcome was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of fracture level in a short-segment fixation for a thoracolumbar junction fractures results in a kyphosis correction and in a maintenance of the sagittal alignment similar to a long-segment instrumentation. Finally, this technique allowed us to save two or more segments of vertebral motion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction is discussed controversially in the literature. Whilst 360 degrees fusion has shown to result in better radiological outcome, recent studies have failed to show its superiority concerning clinical outcome. The morbidity associated with the additional anterior approach may account for these findings. The aim of this prospective observational study was therefore to compare two different techniques for 360 degrees fusion in thoracolumbar burst fractures using either thoracoscopy or a transforaminal approach (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF)) to support the anterior column. METHODS: Posterior reduction and short-segmental fixation using angular stable pedicle screw systems were performed in all patients as a first step. Monocortical strut grafts were used for the anterior support in the TLIF group, whilst tricortical grafts or titanium vertebral body replacing implants of adjustable height were used in the combined posteroanterior group. At final follow-up, the radiological outcome was assessed by performing X-rays in a standing position. The clinical outcome was measured using five validated outcome scores. The morbidity associated with the approaches and the donor site was assessed as well. RESULTS: There were 21 patients in the TLIF group and 14 patients in the posteroanterior group included. The postoperative loss of correction was higher in the TLIF group (4.9 degrees +/-8.3 degrees versus 3.4 degrees +/-6.4 degrees , p{\textgreater}0.05). There were no significant differences regarding the outcome scores between the two groups. There were no differences in terms of return to employment, leisure activities and back function either. More patients suffered from donor-site morbidity in the TLIF group, whilst the morbidity associated with the surgical approach was higher in the posteroanterior group. CONCLUSION: The smaller donor-site morbidity in the posteroanterior group is counterbalanced by an additional morbidity associated with the anterior approach resulting in similar clinical outcome. Mastering both techniques will allow the spine surgeon to be more flexible in specific situations, for example, in patients with neurological deficits or severe concomitant thoracic trauma.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors present clinical outcome data and satisfaction of patients who underwent minimally invasive vertebral body corpectomy and cage placement via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach and posterior short-segment instrumentation for lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Patients with unstable lumbar burst fractures who underwent corpectomy and anterior column reconstruction via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach with short-segment posterior fixation were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic information, operative parameters, perioperative radiographic measurements, and complications were analyzed. Patient-reported outcome instruments (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]) and an anterior scar-specific patient satisfaction questionnaire were recorded at the latest follow-up. RESULTS: Twelve patients (7 men, 5 women, average age 42 years, range 22-68 years) met the inclusion criteria. Lumbar corpectomies with anterior column support were performed (L-1, n = 8; L-2, n = 2; L-3, n = 2) and supplemented with short-segment posterior instrumentation (4 open, 8 percutaneous). Four patients had preoperative neurological deficits, all of which improved after surgery. No new neurological complications were noted. The anterior incision on average was 6.4 cm (range 5-8 cm) in length, caused mild pain and disability, and was aesthetically acceptable to the large majority of patients. Three patients required chest tube placement for pleural violation, and 1 patient required reoperation for cage subsidence/hardware failure. Average clinical follow-up was 38 months (range 16-68 months), and average radiographic follow-up was 37 months (range 6-68 months). Preoperative lumbar lordosis and focal lordosis were significantly improved/maintained after surgery. Patients were satisfied with their outcomes, had minimal/moderate disability (average ODI score 20, range 0-52), and had good physical (SF-12 physical component score 41.7{\%} +/- 10.4{\%}) and mental health outcomes (SF-12 mental component score 50.2{\%} +/- 11.6{\%}) after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior corpectomy and cage placement via a mini-open, extreme lateral, transpsoas approach supplemented by short-segment posterior instrumentation is a safe, effective alternative to conventional approaches in the treatment of single-level unstable burst fractures and is associated with excellent functional outcomes and patient satisfaction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effects of injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation and injured vertebra bone grafting in treating thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 48 patients with single thoracolumbar fractures (type A3) from August 2008 to August 2010. Twenty-four patients were treated with injured vertebra pedicle instrumentation (group A) and 24 were treated with injured vertebra bone grafting (group B). There were 14 males and 10 females with an average age of (44.0 +/- 7.4) years old (34 to 56) in group A and there were 13 males and 11 females with an average age of (42.5 +/- 7.1) years(ranged, 31 to 54) in group B. Operation time, volume of blood loss, complications and the relative parameter of imageology were compared between two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in gender,age, position of injury, volume of blood loss between two groups. Operation time of group A was shorter than that of group B. Cobb angle and injured vertebral height obviously improved at the immediately postoperatively between two groups; there was no significant difference in group A between the immediately and three months postoperatively, but there was significant difference in group B; there was no significant difference between three months and one year postoperatively in two groups. The failure rate of group B was significantly higher than that of group A. CONCLUSION: Pedicle screw fixation in the injured vertebrae has advantage of short operation time,can obtain satisfactory effects and is better than injured vertebra bone grafting in maintaining the reduction in treating single thoracolumbar fractures.},

METHODS: From March 2007 to July 2009, 12 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with surgery in the study. There were 7 males and 5 females, with an average age of 62.3 years (from 56 to 71 years). Nerve functions of all patients were ASIA classified grade E. According to TLICS score system, 6 points were in 5 cases and 7 points were in 7 cases. Expansive pedicle screw system was used and Wright artificial bone was injected into the injuried vertebrae. The anterior border height of vertebral body and Cobb angle were observed at the preoperation, postoperation and final follow-up. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 10 to 15 months with an average of 12 months. Wounds healed well, pain in the chest-back abated, no the expansive pedicle screws loosened or broke down. The anterior border height of vertebral body increased from (32.3 +/- 9.1){\%} preoperatively to (95.3 +/- 3.2){\%} postoperatively; and the Cobb angle decreased from (31.6 +/- 6.8) degrees preoperatively to (4.5 +/- 3.2) degrees postoperatively. There was significant difference between two groups (P{\textless}0.01). After 3 months, the anterior border height of vertebral body was (94.7 +/- 3.3){\%} and the Cobb angle was (4.6 +/- 3.4) degrees; at the final follow-up, the anterior border height of vertebral body was (93.2 +/- 3.6){\%} and the Cobb angle was (5.3 +/- 3.7) degrees. There was no significant difference between the two data (P{\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of expansive pedicle screws fixation and Wright artificial bone injection is a good treatment for thoracolumbar burst fracture, with advantages such as easy operation and good effect, which mainly applied to patients with no obvious nerve injuries.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The treatment of fractures involving the lumbar spine has been controversial. Laminae lesion may be complete or of the greenstick type (incomplete). Dural tears and nerve root entrapment may accompany these laminae fractures. The aim of this study is twofold, to assess the effect of different types of laminae fractures on the anteriorvertebral height restoration in upper lumbar burst fractures and to determine the incidences of the intraoperatively detected dural tear and neural entrapment in complete and incomplete laminae fractures to choose the optimal treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 112 patients with 114 lumbar burst fractures treated operatively, age ranged from 17 to 55 years (mean age 32). Male to female ratio was (93{\%}/7{\%}), 8 females. Patients were divided into three groups, group 1 patients without lamina fracture, group 2 patients with complete type lamina fracture and group 3 patients with (percutaneous) incomplete type lamina fractures. All clinical charts and radiologic data of these groups were analyzed for their association with dural tears, neural entrapment and the impact of lamina fracture (complete and incomplete types) on the efficacy of anterior vertebral height restoration. The severity of injury was determined using the ASIA (Modified Frankel scale). RESULTS: Out of 114 upper lumbar burst fractures, lamina fracture occurred in 34 patients (29.8{\%}), complete lamina fracture occurred in 21 patients (61.7{\%}), whereas incomplete lamina fracture occurred in 13 patients (38.3{\%}). Dural tear was detected in 16 patients (47{\%}) and was predominantly higher in complete type lamina fracture 12 patients (57{\%}) when compared to 4 dural tears (30{\%}) in incomplete lamina fractures. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference in the preoperative anterior vertebral height loss and local kyphotic angle between the three groups. However the anterior vertebral height and local kyhpotic angle restoration were found to be affected by the presence of complete lamina fracture when compared to other groups with incomplete lamina fracture and without lamina fracture (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: In upper lumbar burst fractures, complete lamina fracture is an indicator of injury severity. When detected preoperatively on CT or MRI scanning, it should be operated by open book laminectomy even if the patient is neurologically intact since it carries a high risk of neural entrapment, and its presence affects the intraoperative postural and instrumental trials for anterior vertebral height restoration.},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding the classification systems and surgical management of thoracolumbar spine trauma. METHODS: A Pubmed search of "thoracolumbar", "spine", "fracture" was used on January 05, 2013. Exclusionary criteria included non-Human studies, case reports, and non-clinical papers. RESULTS. One thousand five hundred twenty manuscripts were initially returned for the combined search string; 150 were carefully reviewed, and 48 manuscripts were included in the review. DISCUSSION: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a high prevalence in North America. The thoracolumbar junction is a point of high kinetic energy transfer and often results in thoracolumbar fractures. New classification systems for thoracolumbar spine fractures are being developed in an attempt to standardize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as well as reporting in the literature. Earlier classifications such as the Denis "3-column model" emphasized anatomic divisions to guide surgical planning. More modern classification systems such as the Thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) emphasize initial neurologic status and structural integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex as a guide for surgical decision making and have demonstrated a high intra- and interobserver reliability. Other systems such as the Load-Sharing Classification aid as a useful tool in planning the extent of instrumentation and fusion. CONCLUSION: There is still much controversy over the surgical management of various thoracolumbar fractures. Level I data exists supporting the nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic compromise. However, for the majority of fracture types in this region, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish standards of care.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and therapeutic effects of mono-segmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI) in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 cases with thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) between April 2005 and February 2010. Half of the 60 inpatients were treated with MSPI, and the other half was treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). The mean operation time, blood loss, visual analog scale (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle before and after surgery were compared. RESULTS: In the MSPI group, the mean operation time was 90 +/- 25 min, and the blood loss at operation was 180 +/- 62 ml. The vertebral kyphotic angles were 17.3 degrees +/- 9.3 degrees before surgery, 6.5 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees one week after surgery, and 9.5 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees for the latest follow-up. The VAS scores were 7.5 +/- 1.4 before surgery, 2.5 +/- 0.7 one week after surgery, and 1.4 +/- 0.8 for the latest follow-up. In the SSPI group, the mean operation time was 101 +/- 28 min, and the blood loss at operation was 203 +/- 88 ml. The follow-up duration was 12-64 months. The vertebral kyphotic angles were 16.5 degrees +/- 9.1 degrees before surgery, 7.1 degrees +/- 6.9 degrees one week after surgery, and 7.5 degrees +/- 5.2 degrees for the latest follow-up. The VAS scores were 6.7 +/- 1.5 before surgery, 3.0 +/- 0.4 one week after surgery, and 1.1 +/- 0.6 for the latest follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in the operation time, blood loss at operation, VAS score and vertebral kyphotic angle before and after surgery (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The post-surgical VAS scores and vertebral kyphotic angles were significantly decreased in both groups, compared to before surgery (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is safe and effective to treat thoracolumbar burst fractures (AO 3.1 and AO 3.2) with MSPI. The mean operation time, blood loss at operation, post-surgical VAS and vertebral kyphotic angle of the MSPI group are similar, compared to the SSPI group. Further research is needed to find out whether therapeutic effects of MSPI are better than those of conservative treatment in these cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment of a stable burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction in neurologically intact patients have not shown a meaningful difference at early follow-up. To our knowledge, longer-term outcome data have not before been presented. METHODS: From 1992 to 1998, forty-seven consecutive patients with a stable thoracolumbar burst fracture and no neurological deficit were evaluated and randomized to one of two treatment groups: operative treatment (posterior or anterior arthrodesis) or nonoperative treatment (a body cast or orthosis). We previously reported the results of follow-up at an average of forty-four months. The current study presents the results of long-term follow-up, at an average of eighteen years (range, sixteen to twenty-two years). As in the earlier study, patients at long-term follow-up indicated the degree of pain on a visual analog scale and completed the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Work and health status were obtained, and patients were evaluated radiographically. RESULTS: Of the original operatively treated group of twenty-four patients, follow-up data were obtained for nineteen; one patient had died, and four could not be located. Of the original nonoperatively treated group of twenty-three patients, data were obtained for eighteen; two patients had died, and three could not be located. The average kyphosis was not significantly different between the two groups (13 degrees for those who received operative treatment compared with 19 degrees for those treated nonoperatively). Median scores for pain (4 cm for the operative group and 1.5 cm for the nonoperative group; p = 0.003), ODI scores (20 for the operative group and 2 for the nonoperative group; p {\textless}0.001) and Roland and Morris scores (7 for the operative group and 1 for the nonoperative group; p = 0.001) were all significantly better in the group treated nonoperatively. Seven of eight SF-36 scores also favored nonoperative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While early analysis (four years) revealed few significant differences between the two groups, at long-term follow-up (sixteen to twenty-two years), those with a stable burst fracture who were treated nonoperatively reported less pain and better function compared with those who were treated surgically.},

@article{Spiegl2016a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a general consensus that unstable vertebral body fractures of the thoracolumbar junction with a B type fracture or a high load shear index need to be surgically stabilized, primarily by a dorsal approach. The authors believe that there are indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in cases of reduction loss or a relevant intervertebral disc lesion in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 weeks after dorsal stabilization. However, in cases of unstable vertebral fractures it remains unclear if a delayed anterior spondylodesis will lead to unacceptable loss of initial reduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 59 patients were included in this study during 2013 and 2014. All patients suffered from a traumatic vertebral fracture of the thoracolumbar junction and were initially treated with a dorsal short segment stabilization. All vertebral body fractures had a load shear index of at least 5 or were B type fractures. An x-ray control was carried out after 2 and 6 weeks and MRI was additionally performed after 6 weeks. An additional ventral spondylodesis was recommended in patients showing a reduction loss of at least 5 degrees and in patients with relevant intervertebral disc lesions. The extent of the reduction loss was analyzed. Other parameters of interest were the fracture level, fracture classification, patient age and surgical technique (e.g. implant, index screw, laminectomy and cement augmentation). RESULTS: The patient collective consisted of 23 women and 36 men (average age 51 years +/- 17 years). The mean reduction loss was 5.1 degrees (+/- 5.2 degrees ) after a mean follow-up of 60 days (+/- 56 days). The reduction loss was significantly higher when polyaxial implants were used compared to monoaxial dorsal fixators (10.8 degrees versus 4.0 degrees , p {\textless} 0.001). There was a significantly higher reduction loss in those patients who received a laminectomy (11.3 degrees versus 4.3 degrees , p = 0.01) but there were no significant differences if an index screw was used (4.5 degrees versus 5.3 degrees ). Additionally, there was a significantly lower reduction in the subgroup of patients 60 years or older who were stabilized using cement-augmented screws (3.9 degrees versus 11.3 degrees , p = 0.02). The mean reduction loss was 2.8 degrees (+/- 2.5 degrees ) in patients treated with a monoaxial implant, cement-augmented if 60 years or older and without laminectomy (n = 39). There was no significant correlation between reduction loss and the other parameters of interest, such as fracture morphology with classification according to the working group on questions of osteosynthesis (AO) and McCormack or fracture level. CONCLUSION: Delayed indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures and initial dorsal stabilization will cause no relevant reduction loss if monoaxial implants are used and laminectomy can be avoided. Additionally, cement augmentation of the pedicle screws seems to be beneficial in patients 60 years of age or older.},

METHODS: A comprehensive search of related literature was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library. Clinical outcomes (LBOS and VAS), surgical outcomes (operation time, blood loss, hospital stay and perioperative complications), and radiographic outcomes (kyphotic angle, decreased vertebral body height and segmental motion) were assessed in the meta-analysis. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: Five RCTs and three retrospective studies including a total of 445 cases were identified. We found that there was no significant difference in terms of LBOS, VAS, implant-related complications, kyphotic and VBH parameters. However, there was a significant difference regarding blood loss, operation time, segmental motion and donor site pain between fusion and non-fusion. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated that posterior fixation alone could achieve satisfactory clinical and radiological results in treating thoracolumbar burst fracture. Moreover, posterior fixation without fusion was superior to additional fusion with less blood loss, shorter operation time, better segmental motion and lower donor site pain.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of pedicle screw removal after successful fusion of thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Implant removal is a common procedure in orthopedic surgery, although the benefits of and indications for removal remain controversial. Previous studies on pedicle screw removal have reported conflicting outcomes, because the study subjects and surgical goals were heterogeneous in nature. METHODS: We studied 45 consecutive patients who underwent implant removal and a control cohort of 45 age- and sex-matched patients who retained their spinal implants after successful posterior fusion of thoracolumbar burst fractures using pedicle screw instrument. In most cases, long-segment instrumentation with short-segment posterior fusion was performed. The mean elapsed period prior to implant removal after index fracture surgery was 18.3 +/- 17.6 months. A visual analogue scale for back pain was applied, the Oswestry disability index calculated, and radiological parameters derived at the time of implant removal and 1 and 2 years postoperatively obtained. These data were compared with those of the control group evaluated at the same times after index fracture surgery. RESULTS: Patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, fracture morphologies, and the outcomes of index fracture surgery were similar between the 2 groups. The mean visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index scores were better at both the 1- and 2-year follow-ups in the implant removal group than in the control group (all P values = 0.000). The segmental motion angle of the implant removal group was 1.6 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees at the time of implant removal, and increased significantly to 5.8 degrees +/- 3.9 degrees at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.000), and was maintained at this level at the 2-year follow-up (5.9 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees ) (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: In patients treated successfully for thoracolumbar burst fractures, pedicle screw removal is beneficial because it alleviates pain and disability. Restoration of the segmental motion angle after implant removal may contribute to the clinical improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: While frequently prescribed to patients following fixation for spine trauma, the utility of spinal orthoses during the post-operative period is poorly described in the literature. In this study, we calculated rates of reoperation and performed a decision analysis to determine the utility of bracing following pedicle screw fixation for thoracic and lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Pubmed was searched for articles published between 2005 and 2015 for terms related to pedicle screw fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Additionally, a database of neurosurgical patients operated on within the authors institution was also used in the analysis. Incidences of significant adverse events (wound revision for either dehiscence or infection or re-operation for non-union or instability due to hardware failure) were determined. Pooled means and variances of reported parameters were obtained using a random-effects, inverse variance meta-analytic model for observational data. Utilities for surgical outcome and complications were assigned using previously published values. RESULTS: Of the 225 abstracts reviewed, 48 articles were included in the study, yielding a total of 1957 patients. After including patients from the institutional registry, together a total of 2081 patients were included in the final analysis, 1328 of whom were braced. Non-braced patients were older then braced patients, although this only approached significance (p=0.051). Braced patients had significantly lower rates of re-operation for non-union or clinically significant hardware failure (1.3{\%} vs. 1.8{\%}, p{\textless}0.001) although the groups had comparable rates of operative wound dehiscence and infection (p=1.000). These two approaches yielded comparable utility scores (p=0.120). Costs between braced and non-braced patients were comparable excluding the cost of the brace (p=0.256); hence, the added cost of the brace suggests that bracing post-operatively is not a cost effective measure. CONCLUSIONS: Bracing following operative stabilization of thoracolumbar fracture does not significantly improve stability, nor does it increase wound complications. Moreover, our data suggests that post-operative bracing may not be a cost-effective measure.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare clinical and radiological outcomes between short (SSPF) and long-segment (LSPF) posterior fixation for thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of adult patients, with single-level, TLJ (T11-L2) fractures, treated with posterior fixation between 2007 and 2014 at a regional spinal centre. SSPF and LSPF were defined as transpedicular screw fixation at one and two levels above and below the fractured vertebra, respectively. Construct failure was defined as instrument breakage or screw pull-out requiring operative intervention. Two independent assessors measured the kyphotic Cobb angle at up to six months. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were included with a median age of 38 years (range 20-76 years) and median follow-up period of 14 months (4-41 months). All patients sustained traumatic fractures and the male to female ratio was 19:9. AO fracture classes were: A (29{\%}), B (50{\%}) and C (21{\%}). SSPF and LSPF were performed in 17 (61{\%}) and 11 (39{\%}) patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in age (Fisher's exact, p {\textgreater} 0.99), AO fracture class (chi-squared, p = 0.510), preop TLICS score (independent t-test, p = 0.668) and length of stay (independent t-test, p = 0.106) between the groups. Construct failure occurred in three SSPF cases (3-14 months postop) and was associated with an increased mean loss of correction. By six months, the Cobb angle had increased significantly in the SSPF group (paired t-test, p = 0.049), but not the LSPF group (paired t-test, p = 0.157). CONCLUSIONS: Our data identified a trend towards better clinical and radiological outcomes in the LSPF, compared to the SSPF group. Although supported by some studies, these findings should be evaluated in future clinical trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To offer a correct treatment strategy for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures remains a huge challenge in modern spine surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the years 2002 and 2003 5 patients with incomplete burst fractures (AO type A3.1) of the thoracolumbar spine were included in this study (4 men, 1 woman, average age: 62.6 years, follow-up rate: 100 {\%}). All 5 were treated by kyphoplasty and additional dorsal bisegmental instrumentation. Unlike today, dorsal instrumentation was done without cement augmentation. Inclusion criteria were age above 60 years, an adequate trauma, and a fracture between thoracic body 11 and lumbar body 3. Data acquisition was performed prospectively before and after the operation, after 3, 6, 12, 18 months, and after 5 years, including visual analogue scale (VAS) spine score, spinal function score, X-ray examination or in cases of complaints or limited assessability a CT examination, and SF 36 score after 5 years. As comparison group, we used 4 patients, suffering the same fracture type with a similar fracture location (1 man, 3 women, average age: 67.3 years), who were treated with kyphoplasty alone during the same time period. RESULTS: No clinically relevant intra- and postoperative complications were registered in our study group. The operative bisegmental kyphotic reduction was slightly higher in our study group. Afterwards the correction loss was 9.8 degrees in our study group, exceeding the reduction by 3.6 degrees , whereas the comparison group suffered from a correction loss of 11.8 degrees , exceeding the operative reduction by 8.5 degrees , respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were registered with respect of physical component summary (PSC), mental component summary (MSC) score and VAS spine score. Both groups had comparable PSC and MSC scores to a norm group of the same age. CONCLUSION: After 5 years the therapy concept seems to be of low risk and not being associated with major complications. The PCS and MCS scores are comparable to a norm group of the same age. The correction loss exceeded the operative reduction marginally but turned out to be slightly lower compared to that of an isolated kyphoplasty.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical results of additional screws fixation on fractured vertebrae versus only short-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation for A3 thoracolumbar fracture without neurologic deficit. METHODS: Clinical data of 52 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficit were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were divided into 2 groups due to different instrumentation and all fractures were classified as type A3 according to AO Classification.From January 2005 to December 2006, 23 cases in group A were treated by short-segment posterior instrumentation combined with additional screws fixation on fractured vertebrae. There were 18 male and 5 female with a mean age of (35.3+/-8.3) years. The fracture segment included 1 in T11, 9 in T12, 11 in L1 and 2 in L2. From January 1999 to December 2004, 29 cases in group B were treated only by conventional short-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation. There were 20 male and 9 female with a mean age of (37.3+/-6.8) years. The fracture segment included 1 in T11, 7 in T12, 20 in L1 and 1 in L2. The clinical effect and radiographic measurements were respectively compared preoperatively, immediate and 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: All patients were followed up and the mean follow-up time was (37.4+/-10.9) months (from 24 to 48 months). There was no statistic difference of mean JOA and VAS score between 2 groups preoperatively, immediate and 2 years postoperatively (P{\textgreater}0.05). The average immediate postoperative correction of Cobb's angle was 13.7 degrees+/-7.7 degrees in group A, which was statistically significantly higher than that of 8.8 degrees+/-5.0 degrees in group B (P{\textless}0.01). The mean kyphosis correction loss of 2.9 degrees+/-1.5 degrees in group A was statistically significantly lower than that of 5.0 degrees+/-2.9 degrees in group B 2 years postoperatively (P{\textless}0.01). The average restoration of anterior height of fractured vertebral body immediate postoperatively was (29.4+/-6.0){\%} and (21.7+/-6.9){\%} respectively. The mean correction loss of anterior height 2 years postoperatively was (3.1+/-0.8){\%} and (6.6+/-3.0){\%} respectively. The average restoration of posterior height of fractured vertebral body immediate postoperatively was (8.5+/-3.2){\%} and (6.1+/-1.8){\%} respectively. The mean correction loss of posterior height 2 years postoperatively was (2.0+/-0.8){\%} and (3.4+/-1.0){\%} respectively. There were significant differences in average restoration of anterior/posterior height immediate postoperatively and correction loss of anterior/posterior height 2 years postoperatively between the 2 groups (P{\textless}0.01). According to fracture fragments protruded into the spinal canal on immediate postoperative CT image, there were complete reduction in 11 cases (47.8{\%}) and partial reduction in 12 cases (52.2{\%}) in group A, which was statistically significantly better than those in group B (P{\textless}0.01). There was no severe neurologic complications and no other complications related to additional screws fixation postoperatively. Pedicle screw breakage occurred in 2 cases in group B and none in group A. CONCLUSIONS: Better initial kyphosis correction and less loss of correction 2 years after operation can be obtained by using additional screws fixation on fractured vertebra for thoracolumbar A3 fracture without neurologic deficit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-segment pedicle-screw instrumentation is frequently used to stabilize thoracolumbar burst fractures. A recognized disadvantage of this procedure is recurrent kyphosis from intervertebral disc creep into the fractured central endplate. Balloon Assisted Endplate Reduction (BAER) using Tricalcium Phosphate bone cement (TCP) enables elevation of the centrally depressed endplate. Our objective was to evaluate the bone-tissue response to TCP and to analyse whether BAER using TCP can prevent recurrent kyphosis after removal of the instrumentation. METHODS: Fourteen patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were operated with BAER using TCP in combination with short-segment instrumentation. Nine months after surgery, instrumentation was removed and transpedicular biopsies were taken for histological and histochemical analysis. Roentgenograms pre- and postoperatively and at latest follow-up after removal of the instrumentation were evaluated. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 2.6 years. Analysis of the biopsies showed a variable degree of bone remodelling with incorporation of TCP into newly formed bone matrix. No extensive foreign body reactions, inflammation, granulomatous responses or tissue necrosis were observed. Wedge-angle, kyphosis-angle and both the anterior-posterior and central-posterior vertebral body height ratios improved significant postoperatively (p {\textless} 0.001). After removal of the instrumentation no significant differences in wedge-angle or height ratios were seen (p = 0.12). The kyphosis-angle increased four degrees (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: TCP showed good histological osseointegration with no adverse events. TCP can therefore be safely used and could be beneficial in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. BAER with TCP in combination with short-segment instrumentation might reduce recurrence of deformity even after removal of the instrumentation in comparison to short-segment instrumentation alone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at the at the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR3498).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacies of traditional open versus percutaneous monosegmental pedicle screw fixation in the treatment of incomplete thoracolumbar spinal fracture. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for 44 inpatients with a diagnosis of incomplete thoracolumbar spinal fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) undergoing monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI) from September 2008 to January 2011. There were 24 cases in percutaneous group and 20 cases in traditional open group. The mean operative duration, blood loss, blood drainage, visual analogue scale/score (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle at pre- and post-operation were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant differences existed in operative durations between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Significant differences between two groups were observed in terms of intra-operative blood loss and VAS scores at Week 1 postoperation (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences in VAS score preoperation, 1 year postoperation or pre-and post-operative vertebral kyphotic angle (P {\textgreater} 0.05). No complications of iatrogenic neurological injury or hardware failure occurred. CONCLUSION: The application of percutaneous monosegment pedicle instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures in type of A 3.1 and A 3.2 is both feasible and safe. Its postoperative therapeutic effect is comparable to that of traditional open monosegmental fixation.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The main aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after stabilization by a percutaneous transpedicular system and stabilization from the standard open approach for thoracolumbar spine injury. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in the study over a period of 16 months. Patients were included in the study if they experienced 1 thoracolumbar fracture (A3.1-A3.3, according to the AO/Magerl classification), had an absence of neurological deficits, had no other significant injuries, and were willing to participate. Eighteen patients were treated by short-segment, minimally invasive, percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. The control group was composed of 19 patients who were stabilized using a short-segment transpedicular construct, which was performed through a standard midline incision. The pain profile was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS), and overall satisfaction by a simple 4-stage scale relating to performance of daily activities. Working ability and return to original occupation were also monitored. Radiographic follow-up was defined by the vertebral body index (VBI), vertebral body angle (VBA), and bisegmental Cobb angle. The accuracy of screw placement was examined using CT. RESULTS: The mean surgical duration in the percutaneous screw group was 53 +/- 10 minutes, compared with 60 +/- 9 minutes in the control group (p = 0.032). The percutaneous screw group had a significantly lower perioperative blood loss of 56 +/- 17 ml, compared with 331 +/- 149 ml in the control group (p {\textless} 0.001). Scores on the VAS in patients in the percutaneous screw group during the first 7 postoperative days were significantly lower than those in the control group (p {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in VBI, VBA, and Cobb angle values during follow-up. There was no significant difference in screw placement accuracy between the groups and no patients required surgical revision. There was no significant difference between groups in overall satisfaction at the 2-year follow-up (p = 0.402). Working ability was insignificantly better in the percutaneous screw group; previous working position was achieved in 17 patients in this group and in 12 cases in the control group (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique represents a viable option in the treatment of preselected thoracolumbar fractures. A significant reduction in blood loss, postoperative pain, and surgical time were the main advantages associated with this minimally invasive technique. Clinical, functional, and radiological results were at least the same as those achieved using the open technique after a 2-year follow-up. The short-term benefits of the percutaneous transpedicular screw technique are apparent, and long-term results have to be studied in other well-designed studies evaluating the theoretical benefit of the percutaneous technique and assessing whether the results of the latter are as durable as the ones achieved by open surgery.},

Our aim was to evaluate the results of short-segment pedicle instrumentation enforced by two augmenting screws or injectable artificial bone cement in the fractured vertebra, and compare the differences between these two PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective clinical and radiographic study. Twenty-seven patients were treated with a six-screw construct (group 1), and twenty-nine patients underwenta four-screw construct and fractured vertebra augmentation by injectable calcium sulfate/phosphate cement (group 2). Posterior or posterolateral fusions were not performed in both groups. The severity of the fractured vertebra was evaluated by the load-sharing classification (LSC). Local kyphosis and anterior body height of the fractured vertebra were measured and were follow-up at least 2 years. Any implant failure or loss of correction {\textgreater}10 degrees degrees at the final was defined as failure of surgery. Patients' clinical results were assessed by the Denis scale. RESULTS: Blood loss and operation time were less in group 1 (126.2+/-9.7 vs. 267.6+/-126.1ml, p{\textless}0.001 and 141.2+/-48.7 vs. 189.8+/-16.4min, p{\textless}0.001). Immediately after surgery, group 2 had a better local kyphosis angle (3.7+/-5.3 vs.6.0+/-4.1 degrees , p=0.047) and acquired more anterior body height (94.9{\%}+/-7.6{\%} vs. 84.9{\%}+/-10.0{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Both groups had similar clinical results (pain score: 1.5+/-0.8vs. 1.4+/-0.6, p=0.706; work score: 1.7+/-0.9 vs. 1.6+/-1.0, p=0.854). Group 1 had 3 cases of surgery failure; group 2 had 8 cases of implant failure (p=0.121). The average LSC score of these 11 patients with surgical failure was 7.2. CONCLUSION: Thesix-screw construct had the advantage of shorter operating time, less blood loss, and lower failure rate. For those patients with anLSC score {\textgreater}==7, posterior short-segment instrumentation should be used cautiously.},

Both conservative and operative treatments are widely used in clinical practice to manage thoracolumbar burst fractures. Previous studies showed good functional results with both treatments, but surgical approach has been associated with higher cost and risks of causing unnecessary adverse effects. Searching in Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, we identified 14 systematic reviews including 25 randomized trials. We combined the evidence using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table following the GRADE approach. We concluded that operative treatment may decrease the risk of neurologic impairment, but in turn, could increase the risk of general complications. It is unclear whether there are differences in pain reduction, improvement in function and quality of life, need for subsequent surgery or radiographic progression of kyphosis in both groups.},

METHODS: The prospective randomised controlled study was conducted at the Tianjin 4th Centre Hospital, Tianjin, China, and comprised patients of unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture operated between July 2004 and July 2006 and followed up for five years. The patients were divided randomly into three groups of anterior, posterior and combined anterior and posterior approaches. Clinical data was analysed using SPSS 17. RESULTS: Of the 66 cases in the study, 45 (68.18{\%}) were male and 21 (31.8{\%}) were female, with overall age ranging from 19 to 69 years. There were 22 (33.3{\%}) patients in the anterior group, 23 (35{\%}) in the posterior group, and 21 (32{\%}) in the combined anterior and posterior group. Comparison was made between two respective groups. The combined group was found to have the longest operation time (p {\textless} 0.02; p {\textless} 0.01, respectively), larger blood loss (p {\textless} 0.006; p {\textless} 0.005, respectively), longer hospital stay (p {\textless} 0.01; p {\textless} 0.003, respectively) and higher hospitalisation costs (p {\textless} 0.004; p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly smaller than preoperative one in all groups (p {\textless} 0.01; p {\textless} 0.02; p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: The anterior approach or combined anterior and posterior approach were better options in managing unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture, while the latter should be used only for the burst fracture with a significant posterior column injury.},

abstract = {A prospective study was designed to determine whether posterior instrumentation of the spine in thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures produces indirect decompression of the spinal canal leading to better remodeling and neurological recovery. The study was conducted in Kasturba Medical College Manipal, India. Sixty-eight consecutive cases of thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were treated by posterior instrumentation, and approval from the hospital ethical committee was obtained. The degree of initial spinal canal compromise, indirect decompression, and remodeling were assessed from the computed tomography scans. The neurological status at the time of presentation and at final follow-up was assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association's modified Frankel's grading. The median canal compromise in patients with and without neurological deficit was 47.32 and 39.33{\%}, respectively. The overall mean canal compromise at the time of admission, post-operative, and final follow-up were 47.37, 26.58 and 14.85{\%}, respectively (P = {\textless}0.001). The median canal compromise in patients who recovered was 44.5{\%} and in those with no neurological recovery was 55.85{\%}. The median percentage of canal decompression achieved in patients who recovered was 22.15{\%}, whereas it was 22{\%} in those who did not recover. The median remodeling in recovered and non-recovered groups was 64.50 and 80{\%}, respectively. None of these differences was statistically significant. This study shows that posterior instrumentation of the spine produces significant indirect decompression of the spinal canal and better remodeling. However, these factors may not improve the neurological recovery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective randomized controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of two paraspinal muscle-sparing surgical approaches for the management of neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and posterior ligamentous complex injuries. METHODS: Patients were randomized to undergo either percutaneous (n=31) or paraspinal (n=30) fluoroscopically-guided pedicle screw-rod fixation, and were followed for {\textgreater}/=3 years. Preoperative postural reduction was attempted in all patients. RESULTS: The percutaneous approach was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss and shorter duration of surgery and hospitalization, as well as less pain and better functional recovery at 3 months after surgery compared with the paraspinal approach. Paraspinal surgery resulted in significantly better correction of kyphosis and restoration of vertebral height compared with percutaneous surgery. There were no differences in long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive percutaneous approach appears to be better in cases of successful postural reduction. The paraspinal approach results in better surgical correction and is, therefore, recommended for patients without successful postural reduction.},

The efficiency of ligamentotaxis of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and short-segment implants and fusion in relation to McCormack's classification has not been proven. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of indirect decompression using PLL ligamentotaxis between patients with a high- (score of 7 or higher) or low-grade (score of 6 or less) fracture. Eighteen patients (19 levels) in the low-grade fracture group were compared with 23 patients (27 levels) in the high-grade fracture group. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores; radiologic measures were determined using the spinal canal area and mean sagittal diameter; and the complications were evaluated and compared. A significant improvement in each groups was found in the mean pre- and postoperative spinal canal area, mean sagittal diameter, Cobb's angle, and anterior vertebral height compression rate. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the mean pre- and postoperative spinal canal area, mean sagittal diameter, and anterior vertebral height compression rate. Moreover, the VAS and ODI scores continued to significantly improve at the last follow-up in each group. No difference was found in the prevalence of complications. Despite a high score, no significant difference was found in the clinical and radiological results and the complications. Therefore, indirect decompression using PLL ligamentotaxis was found to be a useful technique for patients who recieve a high McCormack's classification score.},

For this purpose neurologically intact 27 patients having isolated one level thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion in our clinic via 'two above-one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site. A control group consisting of 15 patients having one level thoracolumbar burst fracture treated with long segment posterior spinal fusion in our institute was formed. At the preoperative, postoperative and final follow up period, anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index values of both groups were noted. At the final follow up Visual Analogue Pain Scale and Oswestry disability scores were noted. Retrospective data from both groups underwent statistical analysis. In both groups anterior body height loss, local kyphosis and sagittal index measurements improved at the final follow-up, but there was no significance between two groups in terms of radiological and clinical follow-up data. The loss of correction in local kyphosis of short-segment group in the interval between postoperative and follow-up period was also significant. No implant failure was noted. As a conclusion 'two above one below approach' with intermediate screws at the fracture site is associated with loss of correction radiographically, but favorable clinical outcomes in the presence of any implant failure can be achieved in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture is a controversial issue. Although spinal fusion has been a touchstone of spinal fixation, nonfusion technique have become raising its popularity recently. Some studies suggested that nonfusion had several advantages over fusion. The aim of this prospective study was to compare long segment posterior instrumentation with fusion versus long-segment posterior instrumentation without fusion. METHODS: For this purpose, 42 consecutive patients were assigned to two groups. Group 1 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation with fusion (WF), whereas Group 2 included 21 patients treated by long segment instrumentation without fusion (WOF). Long segment instrumentation was hook fixation (claw hooks attached to second upper vertebra and infralaminar hooks attached to first upper vertebra) above and pedicle fixation (pedicle screws attached to first and second lower vertebrae) below the fractured vertebra. RESULTS: Measurements of local kyphosis, sagittal index and anterior vertebral height compression showed that both group had similar outcome at final follow-up. Moreover, there was no difference between the two groups according to low back outcome score. Also, implant failure rate (4.7{\%}) was quite low in both groups. However, WF group had prolonged operative time, increased blood loss and donor site morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Radiological and clinical parameters demonstrated that spinal fusion is not necessary in long segment posterior instrumentation for the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled follow-up study to review patients with acute thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by anterior instrumentation and reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of anterior instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures and to determine whether anterior-only approach would be sufficient for highly unstable burst fractures. In this prospective follow-up study, we also compared the results of anterior reconstruction with structural grafting and with titanium mesh cage in a randomized fashion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior decompression and reconstruction supplemented with instrumentation is generally believed to be superior to fixation with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation for a highly unstable burst fracture, but the indications and methods for anterior approach has not been fully documented. METHODS: A total of 65 patients undergoing anterior plating for a thoracolumbar burst fracture with a load-sharing score of 7 or more between 2000 and 2003 were included this study. They were randomized to receive iliac crest autograft (group A, n = 32) or titanium mesh cages (group B, n = 33). The patients were similar in the distribution of 3-column injuries (n = 8 in group A vs. n = 9 in group B). During the minimum 4-year (range, 4-7 years) follow-up period, all patients were prospectively evaluated for clinical and radiologic outcomes. The Frankel scale, the ASIA motor score, and the Short Form 36 were used for clinical evaluation, whereas the fusion status and the loss of kyphosis correction for the local kyphosis angle were examined for radiologic outcome. RESULTS: All patients in this study achieved solid fusion, with significant neurologic improvement and no significant correction loss as defined by loss of kyphosis correction. The clinical and radiologic results were not significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.05) at all time points between the 2 groups A and B. Twenty-six of 32 patients in group A still complained of donor site pain to some degree at the final follow-up. No significant impact of 3-column injuries (P {\textgreater} 0.05) were identified on the results for all comparisons. CONCLUSION: Anterior-only instrumentation and reconstruction with structural autograft or titanium mesh cages is sufficient for surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with a load-sharing score of {\textgreater} or = 7 and even with 3-column injuries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decision-making regarding nonoperative versus operative treatment of  patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in the absence of neurologic deficits is controversial. Lack of evidence-based practice may result in patients being treated inappropriately and being exposed to unnecessary adverse consequences. PURPOSE: Using meta-analysis, we therefore compared pain (VAS) and function (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit treated nonoperatively and operatively. Secondary outcomes included return to work, radiographic progression of kyphosis, radiographic progression of spinal canal stenosis, complications, cost, and length of hospitalization. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE((R)), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for 'thoracic fractures', 'lumbar fractures', 'non-operative', 'operative' and 'controlled clinical trials'. We established five criteria for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The main analyses were performed on individual patient data from randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed on VAS pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score, kyphosis, and return to work, including data from nonrandomized controlled trials and using fixed effects meta-analysis. We identified four trials, including two randomized controlled trials consisting of 79 patients (41 with operative treatment and 38 with nonoperative treatment). The mean followups ranged from 24 to 118 months. RESULTS: We found no between-group differences in baseline pain, kyphosis, and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. At last followup, there were no between-group differences in pain, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores, and return to work rates. We found an improvement in kyphosis ranging from means of 12.8 masculine to 11 masculine in the operative group, but surgery was associated with higher complication rates and costs. CONCLUSIONS: Operative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficit may improve residual kyphosis, but does not appear to improve pain or function at an average of 4 years after injury and is associated with higher complication rates and costs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of level of evidence.},

abstract = {The optimum management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is cause for much debate in the literature. Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches are increasingly used in the management of degenerative spinal pathology, their role in treating burst fractures is unknown. Assessing the level of evidence (LOE) for use of MIS approaches in vertebral burst fractures may impart better understanding of how to integrate MIS in the treatment schema for these fractures. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE for all articles published on traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures through to July 2013. LOE was assigned according to the standards set forth by the Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research and the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. Full texts were reviewed to select only those articles discussing MIS approaches as a treatment modality. A total of 501 articles met both inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 403 of those were published within the past two decades. Among those, 35 articles detailed the use of MIS approaches in the management of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. Only three studies provided high LOE: one level 1 study and two level 2 studies. Thirteen studies described the use of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, but all were level 4 or level 5 studies. Currently, the LOE for utilization of MIS approaches to manage traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures is low. Further work in the form of prospective randomized controlled trials is needed to ascertain how MIS may be integrated into the treatment scheme for thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {Background and purpose - Randomized trials have found that treating spinal burst  fractures with reduction and posterior fixation is adequate without the use of bone grafting for definitive fusion. Restitution of intervertebral mobility of such an unfused segment after fracture healing may unload the adjacent parts of the spine and reduce the risk of degeneration of these segments. We used radiostereometry (RSA) to study whether late implant removal would restore the intervertebral mobility of a thoracolumbar segment treated with posterior instrumentation but no bone grafting for unstable spinal fracture. Patients and methods - We identified 7 patients with implant-related back pain at least 1.5 years after a thoracolumbar fracture (Th12 or L1) treated with reduction and posterior instrumentation. The implants were removed and tantalum indicators for RSA were inserted. 3 months later, each patient was examined with RSA. The intervertebral translations and rotations of the thoracolumbar segment, induced by change in position from flexion to extension, were measured. Progressive deformity was registered by conventional radiography and the overall clinical outcome was assessed by the patients. Results - According to RSA, all 7 patients regained some mobility of the fractured thoracolumbar segment. In 1 patient who was primarily treated for a flexion-distraction type of injury, conventional radiography revealed a progressive kyphotic deformity 3 months after implant removal and the clinical outcome was poor. According to the patients, 1 had a fair clinical outcome and 5 had good outcome. Interpretation - Late implant removal may restore segmental mobility after posterior fracture fixation of the thoracolumbar segment if bone grafting has not been used. The clinical consequences, positive or negative, of the residual mobility demonstrated in our small number of patients should be evaluated in studies based on extended patient series and with different fracture types.},

The study included 12 patients (5 male, 7 female) who had vertebral fusion after traumatic thoracolumbar region (T12-L2) burst fractures. Patients were divided into two groups based on fixation type (short or long segment). Twelve healthy age and sex-matched subjects (seven male, five female) served as controls. Quantitative gait data, including all time-distance (walking velocity, cadence, step time, step length, double support time), kinematic (joint rotation angles of pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle), and kinetic data (moments of hip in sagittal and coronal plane) were collected. Three patients had a T12, six patients an L1, and three patients had an L2 lesion. Patients in the two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and time since operation. No significant differences were found in the time-distance, kinematic, and kinetic gait characteristics between the two groups. This preliminary study reveals that the gait characteristics of patients with short and long-segment fusion after thoracolumbar burst fractures were similar to those of healthy subjects and did not differ from each other. However, the present results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Future studies with larger groups are needed to provide additional data to validate these findings.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Surgical treatment in the case of thoracolumbar burst fractures is very  controversial. Posterior instrumentation is most frequently used, however, but the number of levels to be instrumented still remains a matter of debate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 94 patients who had a single burst fracture between T11 and L2 were selected and were managed using posterior instrumentation with anterior fusion when necessary. They were divided into three groups as follows; Group I (n = 28) included patients who were operated by intermediate segment fixation, Group II (n = 32) included patients operated by long segment fixation, and Group III (n = 34) included those operated by intermediate segment fixation with a pair of additional screws in the fractured vertebra. The mean follow-up period was twenty one months. The outcomes were analyzed in terms of kyphosis angle (KA), regional kyphosis angle (RA), sagittal index (SI), anterior height compression rate, Frankel classification, and Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire. RESULTS: In Groups II and III, the correction values of KA, RA, and SI were much better than in Group I. At the final follow up, the correction values of KA (6.3 and 12.1, respectively) and SI (6.2 and 12.0, respectively) were in Groups II and III found to be better in the latter. CONCLUSION: The intermediate segment fixation with an additional pair of screws at the fracture level vertebra gives results that are comparable or even better than long segment fixation and gives an advantage of preserving an extra mobile segment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A review of the literature showed that posterior short-segment fixation including the fractured vertebra (PSFFV) has better outcomes in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures(TBFs) than patients with short-segment pedicle screw fixation(SSPF) alone. However, its efficacy in mild TBFs with load-sharing scores of 3 and 4 points has not been specifically analyzed. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical, functional and radiologic results of PSFFV with SSPF for mild TBFs and to determine whether the screws in the fractured vetebra were necessary for these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, sixty-nine patients with mild TBFs were divided into 2 groups according to the number of instrumented levels. Group A included 34 patients treated by SSPF (four screws:one level above and below the fracture), and Group B included 35 patients treated by PSFFV (six screws: including the fractured vertebra). Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and at follow-up. They included clinical outcomes: visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Being a radiology-based study, the radiologic measures included vertebral wedge angle (VWA), and anterior vertebral height (AVH). RESULTS: A sum of 69 patients (34 patients in Group A and 35 patients in Group B) were enrolled in the study. The patients in both the groups showed similar outcomes with regards to age, gender, fracture type and site. We did not find any statistically difference between the two groups in corrected rate of VWA or AVH (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In terms of clinical variants such as VAS and ODI scores, there were also no significant differences. However, the SSPF had advantages over PSFFV method in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage and postoperative hospitalization time (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no serious complications occurring during our study, such as infection, blood vessel injury, spinal cord or nerve root injury. No patient needed revision for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation. CONCLUSIONS: SSPF alone is a safe and effective surgical method for restoration and maintenance of vertebral column stability in treating mild TBFs. It gives excellent clinical and radiological results regardless of whether the fractured vertebra is included in the fixation or not.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effect of thoracolumbar fractures between single-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the gap of paravertebral muscles and double-segment pedicle screw fixation approach for the stripping of paravertebral muscles. METHODS: From September 2008 to January 2010, 65 patients with incomplete compressed thoracolumbar fractures or burst thoracolumbar fractures with unilateral endplate injury were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty patients were treated with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paravertebral muscles (treatment group). Thirty-five patients were treated with double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of the paravertebral muscles (control group). All the internal fixations were taken out during 10-12 months after operation. Operative time, perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume were compared between two groups. At final follow-up, the change of neurological ASIA grade were recorded; and postoperative 5 days and final follow-up, compared Denis classification of lumbar and back pain between two groups; and analyzed the sagittal index and compressibility of anterior border of vertebral body by X -ray lateral projection. RESULTS: All patients were follow-up from 14 to 22 months with an average of 18.3 months. No postoperative infection, secondary spinal cord injury was found. One case of control group occurred internal fixation breakage at the 11th month after operation and other internal fixation no loosening. There was no significant difference in operative time, the recovery of neurological function between the two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume of treatment group was less than that of control group (P {\textless} 0.01). And in Denis classification of lumbar and back pain, the treatment group recovered more quickly, and the residual pain of lumbar and back was less than that of control group (P {\textless} 0.01). Postoperative posterior salient and compression of anterior border of vertebral body improved in two groups (P {\textless} 0.01), there was no significant difference in degree of improvement between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05); but both loss existed at final follow-up (P {\textless} 0.01), there was no significant difference in loss of posterior salient between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In the treatment group, the loss of rectify of anterior border of vertebral body existed, but it was less than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications, the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paraspinal muscles, can effectively recover the height of vertebral body and rectify posterior salient, and reduce the fixed segment. Compared with the traditional operative method of double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of paraspinal muscle, it can obviously reduce the operation wound and the bleeding, lessen the pain of lumbar and back. And the recent clinical effect is satisfied.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the long term-results after thoracoscopic spondylodesis particularly with respect to a ventral versus dorso-ventral treatment strategy. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, a follow-up examination was performed in 19 patients (seven men, 12 women, average age: 37.7 years, follow-up rate: 79 {\%}), six years after ventral thoracoscopic spondylodesis of unstable, incomplete burst fractures. Nine patients received a ventral monosegmental spondylodesis with iliac crest bone graft. The other ten cases were treated dorso-ventrally, five undergoing a ventral monosegmental treatment with iliac crest bone graft; the other five a ventral bisegmental treatment with expandable titanium cage. RESULTS: The complication rate was 15.7 {\%}, the rate of revision of 10.5 {\%}. No complication was related to the ventral thoracoscopic approach, whereas all of them were related to the iliac crest bone graft. The operative bisegmental kyphotic reduction was higher in the dorso-ventrally treated group. Afterwards, the loss of reduction was similar in both study groups. The mean VAS spine score summed up to more than 80 in both groups. The mean PCS scores were comparable to a normal healthy collective of the same age. CONCLUSIONS: The ventral thoracoscopic approach to the spine seems to be a safe therapeutic strategy. A dorso-ventral treatment concept goes along with a higher operative reduction potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The surgical results of treating thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were reported to be comparable between patients with and without fusion in an intermediate-term follow-up. To our knowledge, no prior report has compared the results of fusion and non-fusion with long-term follow-up. METHODS: This study was designed to provide long-term evaluation of patients with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine treated with short-segment fixation who were randomly assigned to a fusion or non-fusion group. Patients older than sixty years of age at the time of injury and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough Low-Back Outcome Score and the visual analog scale for back pain. Radiographic outcomes were focused on the vertebral body height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the regional segmental motion. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the non-fusion group, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the fusion group. The average follow-up period was 134 months (range, 121 to 161 months). The average preoperative kyphotic angle was 16.4 degrees for the non-fusion group and 19.5 degrees for the fusion group. The average postoperative kyphotic angle was 1.5 degrees for the non-fusion group and 4.0 degrees for the fusion group. At the time of the latest follow-up, the average kyphotic angle was 13.8 degrees for the non-fusion group and 14.7 degrees for the fusion group. The average kyphotic angle between the two groups was similar at all follow-up times. A progressive decrease of the kyphotic angle was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) with time, regardless of fusion. The radiographic outcomes were similar between these two groups at all follow-up times, as were functional outcomes. More patients in the non-fusion group underwent additional surgery to remove implants. Regional segmental motion was preserved in the non-fusion group, with a mean motion (and standard deviation) of 4.2 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees . CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of short segmental fixation with and without fusion for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were comparable. Regional segmental motion could be preserved without fusion, and bone graft donor site complications could be eliminated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 56 inpatients with incomplete thoracolumbar burst fracture (AO classification: A3.1 and A3.2) from April 2005 to January 2010. There were 28 cases were fixed with monosegment pedicle instrumentation (MSPI), 28 cases were fixed with short segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). The operative time, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS) and vertebral kyphotic angle (VK) before and after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: In the group of MSPI, the mean operative time was (93 +/- 20) min; the intraoperative blood loss was (184 +/- 64) ml; the VK angle was 17 degrees +/- 10 degrees before operation, 7 degrees +/- 7 degrees at one week after operation, and 10 degrees +/- 7 degrees at latest follow-up; VAS score was 7.6 +/- 1.5 before operation, 2.4 +/- 0.8 at one week after operation, and 1.5 +/- 0.9 at latest follow-up; no adjacent segment degeneration was found. In the group of SSPI, the operative time was (102 +/- 30) min; the intraoperative blood loss was (203 +/- 88) ml; the VK angle was 17 degrees +/- 9 degrees before operation, 7 degrees +/- 7 degrees at one week after operation, and 8 degrees +/- 5 degrees at latest follow-up; VAS score was 6.8 +/- 1.3 before operation, 3.1 +/- 0.5 at one week after operation, and 1.2 +/- 0.7 at latest follow-up. One case of adjacent segment degeneration was found in 36 months after operation. There were no significantly statistical differences between two groups in operative time, blood loss, VAS score and VK angle before and after surgery (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The VAS score and VK angle at one week after surgery and latest follow-up all decreased obviously than preoperative ones in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MSPI for incomplete thoracolumbar burst fracture is effective and safe. The operative blood loss, the mean operative time, the improvement of VAS score and the VK angle in group MSPI are equal to those in group SSPI.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Thoracolumbar junction burst fractures remain a challenging problem due  to controversy over the treatment choice of short- or long-segment posterior fixation. The aim of the present study was to compare life quality and sexual function of patients after short- and long-segment posterior fixations in the treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 24 sexually active male patients diagnosed with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures were randomly assigned to either the short-segment posterior fixation (SSPF) group or the long-segment posterior fixation group (LLPF). The exclusion criteria were rheumatological disease and spinal surgery history. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index or smoking habits between the groups. The life quality score of EQ-5D and the International Index of erectile function (IIEF-5) score of male patients and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score of female partners were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in the SSPF and LSPF groups was 44.58 and 42.92 years, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the preoperative EQ-5D and IIEF-5 scores of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners. Postoperatively, the EQ-5D scores (p = 0.011) and IIEF-5 scores (p = 0.000) of male patients and the FSFI score of their partners (p = 0.001) were better in the short-segment group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with SSPF have better sexual function and life quality with their partners compared to those treated with LSPF. The main clinical relevance of this study is that the impact of the choice of short or long-segment treatment on postoperative sexual function and life quality should be considered by surgeons when performing posterior fixation after thoracolumbar junction burst fractures.},

Extracanal leakage of both low-viscosity PMMA and calcium phosphate (CP) as well as the following roentgenographic parameters: segmental kyphosis (SKA), anterior (AVBHr) and posterior (PVBHr) vertebral body height ratio, spinal canal encroachment (SCE) clearance, and functional outcome measures: VAS and SF-36, were recorded and compared between the two groups. All patients in both groups were followed for a minimum 26 (Group A) and 25 (Group B) months. Extracanal CP and PMMA leakage was observed in four (18 {\%}) and three (15 {\%}) vertebrae/patients of group A and B, respectively. Hybrid fixation improved AVBHr, SKA, SCE, but PVBHr only in group B. VAS and SF-36 improved postoperatively in the patients of both groups. Short-segment construct with the novel KIVA implant restored better than BK-fractured lumbar vertebral body, but this had no impact in functional outcome.

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: When used to fixate traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures,  pedicle screw constructs may fail in the presence of severe vertebral body comminution as the intervertebral disc can creep through the fractured endplates leading to insufficient anterior column support. Balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and subsequent calcium phosphate cement augmentation may prevent this event by restoring the disc space boundaries. The results of the first studies using BAER after pedicle screw fixation are encouraging, showing good fracture reduction, few complications, and minimal loss of correction at 2 years of follow-up. PURPOSE: To present the clinical and radiological outcome of 20 patients treated for traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures with pedicle screws and BAER after a minimum of 6 years follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty consecutive neurologically intact adult patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiological parameters (wedge/Cobb angle on plain radiographs and mid-sagittal anterior/central vertebral body height on magnetic resonance imaging scans) and patient reported parameters (EQ-5D and Oswestry Disability Index) were used. METHODS: All patients had previously undergone pedicle screw fixation and BAER with calcium phosphate cement augmentation. The posterior instrumentation was removed approximately 1.5 years after index surgery. Radiographs were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, after removal of the pedicle screws, and at final follow-up (minimum 6 years post-trauma). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained preoperatively, 1 month after index surgery, and 1 month after pedicle screw removal. Health questionnaires were filled out during the last outpatient visit. RESULTS: The pedicle screw instrumentation was removed uneventfully in all patients and posterolateral fusion was observed in every case. The mean wedge and Cobb angle converged to almost identical values (5.3 degrees and 5.8 degrees , respectively) and the mid-sagittal anterior and central endplates were reduced to approximately 90{\%} and 80{\%} of the estimated preinjury vertebral body height, respectively; this reduction was sustained at follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes showed favorable results in 79{\%} of the patients. One patient required (posterior) reoperation due to adjacent osteoporotic vertebral body collapse after pedicle screw removal. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon-assisted endplate reduction is a safe and low-demanding adjunct to pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. It may help achieve minimal residual deformity and reduce the number of secondary (anterior) procedures. Despite these positive findings, one in five patients experienced daily discomfort and disability.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study compared two groups of patients who were operated because of thoracolumbar burst fracture secondary to spinal trauma in terms of neurologic deficits, degree of improvement, and radiologic measurements at one-year follow-up. The first group (group I) included the patients who underwent posterior total laminectomy, peroperative reduction of intracanal bone fragments, and posterior spinal instrumentation and the second group (group II) included the patients who underwent total laminectomy, and spinal instrumentation without reduction of free bone fragments. RESULTS: Neither group showed significant correlation with any measurement parameter. Radiological assessments and clinical improvements did not disclosed significant difference between the two groups at one-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Retropulsion of free bone fragments extend the time of surgery and causes complications. This study found that there is no need to retropulse the bone fragments in the spinal canal in patients with unstable burst fractures who underwent total laminectomy and posterior long segment stabilization.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a high incidence of vertebral burst fractures following low velocity trauma in the elderly. Treatment of unstable vertebral burst fractures using the same principles like in stable vertebral burst fractures may show less favourable results in terms of fracture reduction, maintenance of reduction and cement leakage. In order to address these shortcomings this study introduces cementless fixation of unstable vertebral burst fractures using internal fixators and expandable intravertebral titanium mesh cages in a one-stage procedure via minimum-invasive techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 16 consecutive patients (median age 76 years, range 58-94) with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures and concomitant osteoporosis were treated by an internal fixator inserted via minimum invasive technique one level above and below the fractured vertebra. Fracture reduction was achieved and maintained by transpedicular placement of two titanium mesh cages into the fractured vertebral body during the same procedure. Intra- and postoperative safety of the procedure as well as analysis of reduction quality was analysed by 3D C-arm imaging or CT, respectively. Clinical and radiographic follow-up averaged 10.4 months (range 4.5-24.5). RESULTS: Stabilization of the collapsed vertebral body was achieved in all 16 cases without any intraoperative complication. Surgical time averaged 102 +/- 6.6 minutes (71-194). The postoperative kyphotic angle (KA) and Cobb angle revealed significant improvements (KA 13.7 degrees to 7.4 degrees , p {\textless} 0.001; Cobb 9.6 degrees to 6.0 degrees , p {\textless} 0.002) with partial loss of reduction at final follow-up (KA 8.3 degrees , Cobb 8.7 degrees ). VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) improved from 7.6 to 2.6 (p {\textless} 0.001). Adjacent fractures were not observed. One minor (malposition of pedicle screw) complication was encountered. CONCLUSION: Cementless fixation of osteoporotic burst fractures revealed substantial pain relief, adequate maintenance of reduction and a low complication rate. Bony healing after unstable osteoporotic burst fractures is possible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.germanctr.de DRKS00005657.},

All level I-III studies, studies with long-term results and comparative studies were included and summarized. RESULTS: Details of five randomized control trials were included. Additionally, three comparative studies and two studies with long-term outcomes were detailed in this review. The fracture severity reported in the included studies varied tremendously. Most classification used did not adequately describe the complexity of fracture configuration. A wide variety of treatment strategies were outlined, ranging from non-operative therapy to aggressive surgical intervention with combined anterior-posterior approaches. Thus, the treatment of incomplete burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine is quite diverse and remains controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete burst fractures can differ tremendously regarding the degree of instability they confer to the thoracolumbar spine. Based on a detailed review of the literature, it is clear that good results can be obtained with both non-operative and operative strategies to treat these injuries. In the authors' opinion, the intervertebral disc plays a key role in determining the long-term clinical and radiological outcome. Thus, an incorporation of the intervertebral disc pathology into the existing classification systems would be a valuable prognostic factor.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively compared 25 cases that used the autogenous iliac bone grafting with 18 cases that used a titanium mesh cage for reconstruction of the vertebral body. OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and radiographic results of the autogenous iliac bone and a titanium mesh cage used to reconstruct the vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Grafting of the autogenous iliac bone as a strut bone has been traditionally applied for reconstruction of the spine using anterior approach. Although grafting the autogenous iliac bone as a strut bone achieves a high bone fusion rate, it has reported complications in the donor site. For this reason, bone fusion with a mesh cage has been introduced. METHODS: Between March 2000 and December 2010, 43 cases that underwent decompression and instrumented fusion for unstable burst fractures using the anterior approach were enrolled. Levels of injury were T12 in 8 cases, L1 in 19 cases, L2 in 11 cases, and L3 in 5 cases. The mean follow-up period was 64.5 months (range, 14-129 mo). RESULTS: The local kyphotic angle in the group that used the tricortical autogenous iliac bone (group A) was measured 24.81+/-2.27 degrees preoperatively and 4.95+/-0.61 degrees at the last follow-up. The angle in the group that used a titanium mesh cage (group B) was 25.21+/-1.55 degrees preoperatively and 3.9+/-0.43 degrees at the last follow-up. Both groups obtained bone fusion of grade I and II by Bridwell fusion criteria. The operation site visual analog scale and Korean Oswestry disability index did not differ significantly between 2 groups. Donor site visual analog scale and the operation time was significantly in favor of group B (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Titanium mesh cage filled with the autogenous cancellous bone shortened operation time and reduced the risk of complications in the donor site compared with the group that used the tricortical iliac bone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done. MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95{\%} CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95{\%} CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95{\%} CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95{\%} CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95{\%} CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. It is likely, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Controversies persist for the best treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Anterior corpectomy and discectomy followed by reconstruction with intervertebral cage and posterior fixation, for example, are based mainly on the widespread assumption that intervertebral discs involved in burst-type fractures, typically, do not survive the traumatic event and will degenerate irrevocably. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether intervertebral discs, located adjacent to traumatic burst fractures and treated with pedicle screw fixation and direct end-plate restoration, survive the traumatic event or irrevocably progress to severe disc degeneration. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty adult patients with traumatic burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine and treated with pedicle screw fixation and direct end-plate reduction were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Disc degeneration according to the Pfirrmann classification. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained preoperatively, 1 month after surgery and 1 month after pedicle screw removal 12 to 18 months after index surgery. Degeneration of the intervertebral discs adjacent to the fracture was assessed using the Pfirrmann classification. Grade 1/2/3 was defined as mild-to-moderate degeneration of the intervertebral disc (MDID), whereas Grade 4/5 was defined as severe-to-endstage degeneration of the intervertebral disc (SDID). Repeated measure analysis was performed to detect significant differences between MDID and SDID scores. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (38 discs) were fully documented and available for study. All discs showed MDID preoperatively, and while five discs (13{\%}) progressed to SDID at 12 to 18 months posttrauma, the other discs did not show progression of degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Intervertebral discs adjacent to traumatic burst fractures treated with pedicle screw instrumentation and direct end-plate restoration do not routinely seem to progress to severe degeneration at 12 to 18 months postinjury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posterior pedicle screw fixation has become a popular method for treating thoracolumbar burst fractures. However, it remains unclear whether additional fusion could improve clinical and radiological outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of fusion as a supplement to pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MEDLINE, OVID, Springer, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the clinical and radiological efficacy of fusion versus nonfusion for thoracolumbar burst fractures managed by posterior pedicle screw fixation. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We generated pooled risk ratios or weighted mean differences across studies. Based on predefined inclusion criteria, 4 eligible trials with a total of 220 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The mean age of the patients was 35.1 years. 96.8{\%} of the fractures were located at T12 to L1 level. Baseline characteristics were similar between the fusion and nonfusion groups. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding radiological outcome, functional outcome, neurologic improvement, and implant failure rate. The pooled data showed that the nonfusion group was associated with significantly reduced operative time (p{\textless}0.0001) and blood loss (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: The results of this meta-analysis suggested that fusion was not necessary when thoracolumbar burst fracture was treated by posterior pedicle screw fixation. More randomized controlled trials with high quality are still needed in the future.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of reinforcing short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting in restoring vertebral body height and preventing loss of correction in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out from the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China. Forty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit were operatively treated between July 2008 and June 2011. Patients in group A (n=21) were treated by short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting, whereas patients in group B (n=25) were treated by short-segment fixation without bone grafting. The preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up radiographs (anterior, middle, posterior vertebral height, and local kyphosis angle) were evaluated. RESULTS: All 46 patients in both groups obtained satisfactory reduction of fractured vertebrae. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups according to the improvement of body height and local kyphosis angle. However, correction losses were observed in both groups. Less losses of anterior body height (p=0.0007), middle body height (p{\textless}0.0001), and local kyphosis angle (p=0.0447) were detected in group A than group B. The rate of failure in group A (4.8{\%}) was significantly lower than that in group B (28.0{\%}) (p=0.0383). CONCLUSION: Reinforcement of short-segment fixation with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting can effectively restore vertebral body height and prevent loss of correction for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the clinical  outcomes of thoracolumbar burst fractures (TLBFs) treated with open reduction and internal fixation via the posterior paraspinal muscle approach (PPMA) and the post-middle approach (PA). METHODS: Patients with a traumatic single-level TLBFs (T10-L2), treated at our hospital between December 2009 and December 2014, were randomly allocated to Group A (PPMA) and Group B (PA). Sex, age, time from injury to surgery, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale score (ASIAIS), comorbidities, vertebral level, pre- and postoperative kyphotic angle (KA), visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were included in the analysis. Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, x-ray exposure time, postoperative drainage volume, superficial infection, and occurrence of deep infection were documented. The patients were followed up at 2 weeks; 1, 3, and 6 months; 1 and 2 years; and every 6 months thereafter. Radiological assessments were performed to assess fracture union and detect potential loosening and breakage of the pedicle screws and rods at each follow-up. Postoperative VAS and ODI scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were enrolled (30 in Group A and 32 in Group B, respectively). The operative time (P {\textless} .001) and x-ray exposure time (P {\textless} .001) in Group A were significantly longer than those in Group B. However, compared to Group B, there were less intraoperative blood loss (P {\textless} .001), lower postoperative drainage volume (P {\textless} .001), lower VAS scores (2-week (P = .029), 1-month (P = .023), 3-month (P = .047), and 6-month follow-up (P = .010)), and lower ODI scores (2-week, P = .010; 1-month, P {\textless} .001; 3-month, P = .028; and 6-month follow-up, P = .033) in Group A. CONCLUSIONS: Although PPMA required a longer operative time and x-ray exposure time, PPMA provided several advantages over PA, including less intra-operative blood loss and lower postoperative drainage volume, and greater satisfaction with postoperative pain relief and functional improvement, than PA, especially at the 6-month follow-up after surgery. Further high-quality multicenter studies are warranted to validate our findings.},

METHODS: From January 2008 to May 2014,36 cases of thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent operation of decompression, fusion, and internal fixation was retrospective analyzed. Among them, 16 patients were treated through posterior approach as posterior group, including 13 males and 3 females aged from 37 to 62 years old; 9 cases caused by falling injury, 3 cases by traffic accident injury,4 cases by heavy aboved;the injury segment was on T(1)(2) in 2 cases, L(1) in 5 cases, L(2) in 7 cases, L(3) in 2 cases; according ASIA grade, 3 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 2 cases were grade C, 5 cases were grade D, 4 cases were grade E; the time between injury and operation ranged from 5 to 15 days. Other 20 patients were treated through anterior-lateral approach as anterior-lateral group, including 15 males and 5 females with age from 27 to 62 years old; 12 cases caused by falling injury, 4 cases by traffic accident injury, 4 cases by heavy aboved; the injury segment was on T(1)(2) in 2 cases, L(1), in 7 cases, L(2) in 9 cases, L(3) in 2 cases; for ASIA grade: 4 cases were grade A, 2 cases were grade B, 4 cases were grade C, 6 cases were grade D, 4 cases were grade E; the time between injury and operation ranged from 4 to 12 days. The operation time, bleeding during operation and postoperative drainage volume were observed in two groups,and the changes of nerve function of ASIA grade, clinical efficacy,improved degree of thoracic and lumbar lordosis,and bony fusion were compared between two groups. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 12 to 24 months with an average of (15.8 +/- 3.3) months. The operation time, bleeding during operation, and postoperative drainage volume had no significant different between two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). As compared with preoperative, ASIA grade of two groups at last follow-up had statistically significantly different (P {\textless} 0.01), the neural function of two groups after operation was recovered for different extent. The JOA score of two groups was compared between last follow-up and preoperative, the difference had statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.01), the two groups showed good clinical effect. The clinical results of ASIA grade, JOA score and RIS had no significant differences between two groups. All patients of two groups were obtained fusion. Thoracic and lumbar lordosis angle improvement degree had no significant difference between two groups ,it bad significant difference had statistical significance compared with preoperative, the two approaches could effectively restore the spinal sequence. CONCLUSION: For patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture just treated by anterior decompression and reconstruction of anterior column, according to the degree of operation performer' skill proficiency and the patient' condition to choose, but for patients must performed the spinal canal decompression anterior and posterior, the three column-reconstruction to required anterior-posterior approach, the posterior unilateral approach corpectomy fusion screw-rod fixation obviously shorten operation time, reduce the operation wound, it is worth the clinical promotion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the methods for, and clinical outcome of, the operative treatment of thoracolumbar fractures through an approach via the paravertebral muscle (PVM). METHODS: From June 2005 to August 2006, 62 patients, comprising 48 men and 14 women with an average age of 45.2 years (range, 21-58) with thoracolumbar fractures without neurological involvement underwent surgical treatment. Twenty-one fractures were located at T12, 24 at L1 and 17 at L2. The study comprised 15 compression and 47 burst fractures with an intact posterior column. Thirty-four cases were selected randomly to undergo surgery through the above approach, while the other 28 cases underwent the traditional procedure. After making a posterior midline incision, which not only facilitates insertion of pedicle screws and fusion of the graft bone at facet joints, but spares the attachment of PVM, the interval between the longissimus and multifidus muscles was undermined. Drainage was not routinely needed and the patients became ambulant with a brace earlier post-operatively. RESULTS: The new approach had statistically significant advantages (P {\textless} 0.005) over the traditional one in regard to blood loss, drainage, duration of recumbency and visual analogue scale (VAS), although the time required was almost the same for the two procedures. Till August 2007, 56 patients were successfully followed up for 12 to 26 months (mean, 18.6) and bone fusion was identified in all cases. Neither reduction loss nor loosening or breakage of the fixation occurred. CONCLUSION: The technique of operating through an approach between the PVM is recommended for thoracolumbar fractures because it is much less invasive, can reduce blood loss and accelerates rehabilitation.},

Methods: Between May 2014 and February 2016, 43 cases of type A3 thoracolumbar burst fracture with or without nerve symptoms were treated with pedicle screw fixation and neural decompression. Of them, 21 patients underwent percutaneous pedicle screw fixation and minimally invasive decompression in the same incision (percutaneous group), and the other 22 patients underwent traditional open surgery (open group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, fractures level, preoperative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) score, load-sharing classification, height of injury vertebrae, kyphotic Cobb angle, and spinal canal encroachment between 2 groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05). The length of soft tissue dissection, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, X-ray exposure times, and incision visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 1 day after operation were recorded and compared. At last follow-up, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and low back pain VAS score were recorded and compared respectively. The ASIA grade recovery was evaluated; the height of injury vertebrae, kyphotic Cobb angle, and spinal canal encroachment were assessed postoperatively. Results: Percutaneous group was significantly better than open group in the length of soft tissue dissection, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and incision VAS at 1 day after operation ( P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found in operation time between 2 groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05); however, X-ray exposure times of open group were significantly better than that of percutaneous group ( P{\textless}0.01). The patients were followed up 12 to 19 months (mean, 15.1 months) in 2 groups. All patients achieved effective decompression. No complications of iatrogenic neurological injury and internal fixation failure occurred. The height of injury vertebrae, kyphotic Cobb angle, and spinal canal encroachment of the fractured vertebral body were significantly improved at 3 days after operation when compared with preoperative ones ( P{\textless}0.05), but no significant difference was found between 2 groups ( P{\textgreater}0.05). At last follow-up, JOA score and low back pain VAS score of percutaneous group were significantly better than those of open group ( P{\textless}0.05). The neurological function under grade E was improved at least one ASIA grade in 2 groups, but no significant difference was shown between 2 groups ( Z=0.480, P=0.961). Conclusion: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation and minimally invasive decompression in the same incision for type A3 thoracolumbar burst fracture has satisfactory effectiveness. And it has the advantages of minimal trauma, quick recovery, safeness, and reliableness.},

To evaluate whether failure of the fracture fragment at the anterior column reduction in thoracolumbar fracture has an influence on the final radiologic and clinical outcomes.Cervical teardrop fracture has caused wide concern in spinal surgery field. Although similar fracture fragment at the anterior column was also observed in thoracolumbar burst fractures, the conception of teardrop fracture in thoracolumbar fractures was rarely mentioned in the literature, let alone a study.Fifty patients who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fractures with a fracture fragment at the anterior column were prospectively analyzed. Twenty-seven patients in whom the fragments were reduced by posterior surgery, verified by postoperative X-ray or CT, were included in the reduced group, and 23 patients were included in the nonreduced group. Radiologic and clinical outcomes of both groups were compared after over 2 years follow-up.There was no significant difference regarding to Cobb angle, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, and disc grade between the 2 groups preoperatively. At final follow-up, the mean angle of kyphosis was 13.91 degrees +/- 3.47 degrees in the nonreduced group and 8.42 degrees +/- 2.07 degrees in the reduced groups (P {\textless} 0.01). All fractures consolidated in the reduced group, but the nonreduced group revealed 3 cases with nonunion. Besides, the average Pfirrmann grade of degenerative disc adjacent to the fractured vertebral was 2.87 +/- 1.18 in the nonreduced group, higher than 1.81 +/- 0.62 in the reduced group (P {\textless} 0.01). The ODI score in the nonreduced group was 0.54 +/- 0.13 and 0.36 +/- 0.12 in the reduced group (P {\textless} 0.01).In the present study, failure reduction of the fracture fragment at the anterior column could result in poor radiologic and clinical outcomes of the thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with posterior surgery. Therefore, we recommend the surgeon should pay more attention to reducing the fracture fragment at the anterior column.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the medium and long-term outcomes of lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior versus posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: A total of 47 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were divided into 2 groups according to surgical approaches. Group A underwent lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior approach while group B had posterior approach with subtotal corpectomy, decompression and reconstruction of spine. During a follow-up period of 36-68 months, their clinical and radiological outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. The perioperative volume of blood loss, operative duration, complications, pulmonary functions, Frankel scale and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores were recorded and analyzed. And the heights of anterior edge of vertebral body and Cobb angle were examined for radiological outcomes. RESULTS: At the latest follow-up, all patients achieved solid fusion with significant neurological improvements. The perioperative volumes of blood loss were less, operative duration was shorter and postoperative pulmonary functions were better in the group B (P {\textless} 0.05). The ASIA motor score and radiological outcomes were not significantly different at all timepoints between two groups (P {\textless} 0.05). But the neurological functions of two groups improved by approximately 1.4 Frankel grade (group A) versus 1.41 (group B) at the final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Lateral position one-stage plus anteroposterior and posterior approaches with subtotal corpectomy, decompression, and reconstruction of spine are adequate surgical treatments for thoracolumbar burst fractures. But the latter has the major advantages of less perioperative volume of blood loss, fewer complications, shorter operative duration and better pulmonary functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures is controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare intermediate-segment (IS) and long-segment (LS) instrumentation in the treatment for these fractures. METHODS: IS instrumentation was considered as pedicle fixation two levels above and one level below the fractured vertebra (infra-laminar hooks attached to lower vertebra with pedicle screws). LS instrumentation was done two levels above and two levels below the fractured vertebra. Among a total of 25 consecutive patients, Group 1 included ten patients treated by IS pedicle fixation, whereas Group 2 included fifteen patients treated by LS instrumentation. RESULTS: The measurements of local kyphosis (p = 0.955), sagittal index (p = 0.128), anterior vertebral height compression (p = 0.230) and canal diameter expansion (p = 0.839) demonstrated similar improvement at the final follow-up between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.05) between Group 1 and Group 2 regarding clinical outcome [Hannover scoring system, Oswestry disability questionnaire and the range of motion of the lumbar region compared to neutral (0 degrees )]. CONCLUSIONS: The radiographic parameters were the same between the two groups. However, the clinical parameters demonstrated that IS instrumentation is a more effective management of thoracolumbar burst fractures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal canal remodeling results according to Magerl classification and fracture localization after short- and long-segment posterior instrumentation treatment were evaluated in patients with thoracolumbar junction burst fracture. METHODS: Eighty patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: short-segment posterior instrumentation was applied in 36 patients [9F, 27M; Median age: 42.1 (range: 19-65)] and Group 2: long-segment posterior instrumentation was applied in 44 patients [18F, 26M; Median age: 46.3 (range: 18-78)]. Twenty patients had T12, 41 patients had L1 and 19 patients had L2 fracture. According to Magerl classification, 44 patients were A3.1, 19 were A3.2 and 17 were A3.3. In both groups, spinal canal remodeling effectiveness was evaluated postoperatively with respect to all parameters. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 35.7 months for Group 1 (12-58) and 33.1 months for Group 2 (12-58). In both groups, spinal canal remodeling was statistically significant, but a higher recovery ratio was obtained in Group 2 in comparison to Group 1. According to Magerl classification, in type A3.3 fractures, a more significant remodeling was obtained in Group 2 patients (p=0.005). A significant difference was determined in Group 2 at the T12 level according to fracture localization (p=0.018). CONCLUSION: An adequate spinal canal remodeling is obtained by posterior instrumentation, but in comminuted fractures like Magerl type A3.3, a better remodeling can be obtained by long-segment posterior instrumentation.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial was conducted. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiologic late results of monosegmental transpedicular fixation versus short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI) in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures and evaluate the efficacy of monosegmental transpedicular fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SSPI (1 level above and 1 below the fracture level) are accepted by many surgeons as an accepted technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. To preserve more motion segments, some authors have advocated monosegmental pedicle instrumentation (MSPI). The recent developments showed that MSPI yielded good clinical results; however, there were no report about comparison of clinical outcome between monosegmental and biosegmental transpedicular fixation in management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Eighty-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were randomized by a simple method into 2 groups. Group 1 were treated with monosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 47), and group 2 were treated with biosegmental transpedicular fixation (n = 38). Clinical (Low Back Outcome Score and Oswestry Disability Index) and radiologic (load-sharing classification index, sagittal index, and percentage of anterior body height compression) outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in age, follow-up period, and severity of the deformity and fracture. The postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, local kyphosis, percentage of anterior body height compression, and average correction loss in local kyphosis in both groups were not significantly different. The failure rate between the 2 surgical approaches was also not significantly different (group 1 = 6.38{\%} and group 2 = 5.26{\%}). Oswestry Disability Index improved in both groups by {\textgreater}25 points in a similar amount (P = 0.23). The average follow-up Low Back Outcome Score was 74.9 and 60.2 for group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = 0.033). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, radiologic parameters demonstrated that both MSPI and SSPI are the effective and reliable operative techniques for selected thoracolumbar burst fractures. MSPI shortened the operative time and decreased the amount of blood loss significantly and, thus, offered better clinical results. Nevertheless, long-term studies are supposed to be performed to support the outcomes.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that thoracolumbar AO Type A spine fractures without neurologic deficit, managed with short-segment posterior stabilization will show an improved radiographic outcome and at least the same functional outcome as compared with nonsurgically treated thoracolumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are various opinions regarding the ideal management of thoracolumbar Type A spine fractures without neurologic deficit. Both operative and nonsurgical approaches are advocated. METHODS: Patients were randomized for operative or nonsurgical treatment. Data sampling involved demographics, fracture classifications, radiographic evaluation, and functional outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen patients received nonsurgical therapy, and 18 received surgical treatment. Follow-up was completed for 32 (94{\%}) of the patients after a mean of 4.3 years. At the end of follow-up, both local and regional kyphotic deformity was significantly less in the operatively treated group. All functional outcome scores (VAS Pain, VAS Spine Score, and RMDQ-24) showed significantly better results in the operative group. The percentage of patients returning to their original jobs was found to be significantly higher in the operative treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a Type A3 thoracolumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit should be treated by short-segment posterior stabilization.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of the current study is to establish a surgical algorithm to accompany the AOSpine thoracolumbar spine injury classification system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A survey was sent to AOSpine members from the six AO regions of the world, and surgeons were asked if a patient should undergo an initial trial of conservative management or if surgical management was warranted. The survey consisted of controversial injury patterns. Using the results of the survey, a surgical algorithm was developed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The AOSpine Trauma Knowledge forum defined that the injuries in which less than 30 {\%} of surgeons would recommend surgical intervention should undergo a trial of non-operative care, and injuries in which 70 {\%} of surgeons would recommend surgery should undergo surgical intervention. Using these thresholds, it was determined that injuries with a thoracolumbar AOSpine injury score (TL AOSIS) of three or less should undergo a trial of conservative treatment, and injuries with a TL AOSIS of more than five should undergo surgical intervention. Operative or non-operative treatment is acceptable for injuries with a TL AOSIS of four or five.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The current algorithm uses a meaningful injury classification and worldwide surgeon input to determine the initial treatment recommendation for thoracolumbar injuries. This allows for a globally accepted surgical algorithm for the treatment of thoracolumbar trauma.},
