Background: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of thoracolumbar burst fractures
(TLBFs) treated with open reduction and internal fixation via the posterior paraspinal muscle approach (PPMA) and the post-middle
approach (PA).
Methods: Patients with a traumatic single-level TLBFs (T10-L2), treated at our hospital between December 2009 and December
2014, were randomly allocated to Group A (PPMA) and Group B (PA). Sex, age, time from injury to surgery, the American Spinal Injury
Association Impairment Scale score (ASIAIS), comorbidities, vertebral level, pre- and postoperative kyphotic angle (KA), visual analog
scale (VAS) pain score, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were included in the analysis. Operative time, intraoperative
blood loss, x-ray exposure time, postoperative drainage volume, superficial infection, and occurrence of deep infection were
documented. The patients were followed up at 2 weeks; 1, 3, and 6 months; 1 and 2 years; and every 6 months thereafter.
Radiological assessments were performed to assess fracture union and detect potential loosening and breakage of the pedicle
screws and rods at each follow-up. Postoperative VAS and ODI scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes.
Results:A total of 62 patients were enrolled (30 in Group A and 32 in Group B, respectively). The operative time (P<.001) and x-ray
exposure time (P<.001) in Group A were significantly longer than those in Group B. However, compared to Group B, there were less
intraoperative blood loss (P<.001), lower postoperative drainage volume (P<.001), lower VAS scores (2-week (P=.029), 1-month
(P=.023), 3-month (P=.047), and 6-month follow-up (P=.010)), and lower ODI scores (2-week, P=.010; 1-month, P<.001; 3-
month, P=.028; and 6-month follow-up, P=.033) in Group A.
Conclusions: Although PPMA required a longer operative time and x-ray exposure time, PPMA provided several advantages over
PA, including less intra-operative blood loss and lower postoperative drainage volume, and greater satisfaction with postoperative
pain relief and functional improvement, than PA, especially at the 6-month follow-up after surgery. Further high-quality multicenter
studies are warranted to validate our findings.

PA","the mean spine pedicle width in the Asian
population is only approximately 8mm,[9] increasing the risk
pedicle screw placement failure, which can lead to serious
surgical complications, such as neurovascular injury, visceral
injury and decreased vertebral stability.[10] To reduce the
potential risk for failure, most clinicians tend to choose a
large-incision post-middle approach (PA) for implantation.
However, the PA approach results in extensive soft-tissue
damage, secondary to stripping of the posterior paraspinal
muscles away from the spine. In 1959, Watkins[11] first proposed
use of a posterior paraspinal muscle approach (PPMA) to the
lumbar spine. Subsequently, Wiltse et al[12,13] adapted the PPMA
to approach the thoracic spine between the lateral border of the
multifidus and the longissimus, demonstrating that a PPMA
might provide easy access to the facet and transverse process and,
therefore, be useful as a surgical approach for pedicle screw
placement and posterolateral fusion, without creating vertebral
canal decompression.",,,"Patients who met the inclusion criteria were numbered by
